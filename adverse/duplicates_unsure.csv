Shakshi	Esperanza Caridad MARADIAGA LOPEZ	Individual	https://todaynicaragua.com/us-pushes-honduras-to-crack-down-on-cachiros/	"US authorities, with Honduras government assistance, have cracked down on one of Honduras’ largest drug transport organizations, the Cachiros, seizing properties and businesses and in the process painting a picture of a group whose reach may extend to Honduras’ political and possibly its financial elite.

Honduras police and military have identified 61 properties, 4 commercial establishments, and 24 vehicles in two provinces for seizure, as well as 64 dollar and lempira bank accounts to be frozen at the US Treasury Department’s behest, La Prensa reported.

The US Treasury estimated the value of the assets at $500 million, the newspaper said.

In a statement, the Treasury said the Cachiros is headed by Javier and Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, and its members include their father, Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona, mother, Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez, sister, Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga, and brother, Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga. They do not face charges in Honduras and no formal indictment has been released in the United States.

As opposed to its July 1 statement, in which it named the group as “specially designated narcotics traffickers” without providing details, the Treasury this time identified several companies the group controls, among them a mining operation, a cattle ranch, an African Palm oil processor and a zoo.

An anonymous Treasury source told El Heraldo that there were “dozens” of companies and proxies laundering money for the organization.

The money comes from the group’s lucrative drug trafficking business, which the Treasury detailed in its statement.

“Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel,” the Treasury said. “Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.”

InSight Crime Analysis

If you look at the organizational chart provided by the Treasury (see below, or for complete version see attachment), you might mistake this group for a small, rural band of gangsters. But this organization has deep contacts in the country’s elite that keep their money safe and the judicial authorities at bay. It also has a distribution network that stretches into three countries.

At least part of their reach came to light in a Wikileak cable in which outgoing Ambassador Charles Ford spoke candidly about then President Manuel Zelaya. In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups “have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own” to a high level post in the Security Ministry.

One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros’ candidate for the ministry job.

The Treasury also does not mention the family’s possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros.
The club counts Banco Continental — a company managed by one of the country’s wealthiest families — as one of its other sponsors.

The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams.

The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south.

However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala – Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime’s estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province.

The Cachiros are the second large organization that the US Treasury has outed in recent months from Honduras. The other is led by Jose Miguel “Chepe” Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after the US added him to the same list the Cachiros made in July.

As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged. The head of the Senate’s banking committee called on banks to stop doing business with money launderers; a frontrunner in November’s presidential elections said all candidates should “abstain from using dirty money.”

But sincerity is in short supply in Honduras. Santos Isidro Rivera was arrested briefly earlier this year on weapons charges but released. Leonel was arrested in 2011, but also released.

The Honduran state has largely collapsed, leaving a rich stew of corruption and drug trafficking, which is now boiling over. Witness the fact that the Cachiros have a road construction business, the perfect way to feed corrupt politicians and launder illicit proceeds at the same time.

Drug traffickers still appear to fear the United States, especially the prospect of extradition, which the Honduras government recently green-lighted. However, only one person, who was not a Honduran, has been extradited since, and while the United States is pressuring for the Honduran government to start capturing and extraditing local suspects, the subject appears to be too sensitive, especially with presidential elections coming.

To be sure, the United States, despite providing millions in support for the security and judicial authorities in Honduras, seems to have run out of ways to pressure the Honduran state to reform its own institutions and to take action on its own. And while efforts such as the move to tackle the Cachiros are an important first step, they came at the behest of a powerful outsider, not a reform-minded, courageous Honduran seeking to change the direction of this nation."

In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups “have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own” to a high level post in the Security Ministry.</p>\n\n<p>One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. <a href=""http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2006/05/03/hoy/mundo/587460.html"">Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated</a> shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros’ candidate for the ministry job.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury also does not mention the family’s possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros. <br>The club counts Banco Continental — a company managed by one of the country’s wealthiest families — as one of its other sponsors.</p>\n\n<p>The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities <a href=""http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/263104"">arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron</a> last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the <a href=""http://nuevaya.com.ni/2013/04/presentan-nuevas-pruebas-contra-supuesto-narco-del-cartel-del-valle-de-colombia/"">Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala – Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime’s estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province.</p>\n\n<p>The Cachiros are the second large organization that the US Treasury has outed in recent months from Honduras. The other is led by Jose Miguel “Chepe” Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after <a href=""http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/honduras-congressional-hopeful-added-to-us-kingpin-list"">the US added him to the same list</a> the Cachiros made in July.</p>\n\n<p>As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged. The head of the Senate’s banking committee called on banks <a href=""http://www.latribuna.hn/2013/09/20/bancos-deben-bloquear-las-cuentas-por-lavado-de-activos/"">to stop doing business with money launderers</a>; a frontrunner in November’s presidential elections said <a href=""http://www.latribuna.hn/2013/09/20/juan-orlando-hernandez-todo-politico-debe-abstenerse-de-usar-dinero-oscuro-o-mal-habido/"">all candidates should “abstain from using dirty money.”</a></p>\n\n<p>But sincerity is in short supply in Honduras. <a href=""http://www.elheraldo.hn/Secciones-Principales/Sucesos/Detienen-a-cinco-personas-en-operativo-en-Ticamaya"">Santos Isidro Rivera was arrested briefly</a> earlier this year on weapons charges but released. <a href=""http://www.radiocadenavoceshn.com/rcv/todas-las-noticias/sucesos/seguridad-da-nombre-de-miembro-de-los-cachiros.html"">Leonel was arrested in 2011</a>, but also released.</p>\n\n<p>The Honduran state has largely collapsed, leaving a rich stew of corruption and drug trafficking, which is now boiling over. Witness the fact that the Cachiros have a road construction business, the perfect way to feed corrupt politicians and launder illicit proceeds at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Drug traffickers still appear to fear the United States, especially the prospect of extradition, which the Honduras government recently\xa0green-lighted. However, only one person, who was not a Honduran, has been extradited since, and while the United States is pressuring for the Honduran government to start capturing and extraditing local suspects, <a href=""http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/honduras-murders-sparks-fear-of-extradition-backlash"">the subject appears to be too sensitive</a>, especially with presidential elections coming.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, the United States, despite providing millions in support for the security and judicial authorities in Honduras, seems to have run out of ways to pressure the Honduran state to reform its own institutions and to take action on its own. And while efforts such as the move to tackle the Cachiros\xa0are an important first step, they came at the behest of a powerful outsider, not a reform-minded, courageous Honduran seeking to change the direction of this nation.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2013-09-21T03:43:03-06:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2013-09-21T03:43:03-06:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	am	Duplicate of row 703	Canberk		US Pushes Honduras to Crack Down on Cachiros
Shakshi	Santos Isidro RIVERA MARADIAGA	Individual	https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl2168.aspx	"Action Sanctions Individuals and Businesses Linked to Los Cachiros

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of seven individuals and five businesses tied to the Honduran drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros. The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization: Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros). In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization's drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.

""Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,"" said Treasury's Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin. ""Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are – drug traffickers and money launderers.""

Today's action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.

""Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers. We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,"" said DEA's Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.

This action marks the U.S. Government's second action against Los Cachiros in four months. In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today's action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.

In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime. Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.

The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization. The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Shakshi	Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad MANSUR	Individual	https://editorials.voa.gov/a/treasury-designates-four-hezbollah-leaders/1742730.html	"The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group which has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization since 1997. They are Khalil Yusif Harb, Muhammad Kawtharani, Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur and Muhammad Qabalan.

These individuals were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters for acting for, or on behalf of Hezbollah. This means that their assets within the reach of the United States will be frozen. No U.S. citizen may engage in business with them.

Since the 1980s, Khalil Yusif Harb has served as a leader within Hezbollah. In 2010, he planned unspecified attacks against Israeli officials in Israel and later served as commander of a Lebanon-based special unit that focused on Israel. He has also been involved in Hezbollah’s finances, last year facilitating the movement of large amounts of currency to Yemen.

Muhammad Kawtharani has worked on behalf of Hezbollah's leadership to promote the group's interests in Iraq, including Hezbollah’s efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi insurgent groups. Kawtharani last year assisted in moving fighters to Syria to support the Assad regime.

Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur served as an Egypt-based leader of a Hezbollah cell that targeted tourist destinations. In 2009, Mansur’s cell was disrupted and, along with a number of his fellow operatives, he was arrested for planning to carry out terrorist operations against Israeli and other tourists in Egypt. He was sentenced by an Egyptian court to 15 years in prison, but escaped and returned to Lebanon.

Muhammad Qabalan was the Lebanon-based leader of Unit 1800, and Mansur’s superior, coordinating the Egyptian cell’s activities from Lebanon. For his involvement, he was sentenced in absentia by the Egyptian court, to life imprisonment.

“Whether ferrying foreign fighters to the front lines of the Syrian civil war or inserting clandestine operatives in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere, Hezbollah remains a significant global terrorist threat,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “So long as Hezbollah spreads instability, conducts terrorist attacks and engages in criminal and illicit activities around the world, we will continue to sanction Hezbollah’s operatives, leaders and businesses, wherever they may be found.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605054150955-c254562c88f0a478', 'domain': 'voa.gov', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://editorials.voa.gov/a/treasury-designates-four-hezbollah-leaders/1742730.html', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://editorials.voa.gov/a/treasury-designates-four-hezbollah-leaders/1742730.html', 'author': 'VOA', 'images': ['https://gdb.voanews.com/ACE1CB5C-F98C-4AAB-AA33-237127110DDC_cx0_cy3_cw0_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/ED0AAB4A-26A2-468D-8D4D-527999136376_cx0_cy6_cw0_w250_r1.jpg'], 'headline': 'Treasury Designates Four Hezbollah Leaders', 'audioUrls': ['https://av.voanews.com/clips/ENGL/2013/09/03/f3da69a2-082c-4c72-9761-65529bace170.mp3'], 'mainImage': 'https://gdb.voanews.com/ACE1CB5C-F98C-4AAB-AA33-237127110DDC_cx0_cy3_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': ""The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group which has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization since 1997.

He was sentenced by an Egyptian court to 15 years in prison, but escaped and returned to Lebanon.\n\nMuhammad Qabalan was the Lebanon-based leader of Unit 1800, and Mansur’s superior, coordinating the Egyptian cell’s activities from Lebanon. For his involvement, he was sentenced in absentia by the Egyptian court, to life imprisonment.\n\n“Whether ferrying foreign fighters to the front lines of the Syrian civil war or inserting clandestine operatives in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere, Hezbollah remains a significant global terrorist threat,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “So long as Hezbollah spreads instability, conducts terrorist attacks and engages in criminal and illicit activities around the world, we will continue to sanction Hezbollah’s operatives, leaders and businesses, wherever they may be found.”"", 'authorsList': ['VOA'], 'description': 'The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah.', 'probability': 0.9835677, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://editorials.voa.gov/a/treasury-designates-four-hezbollah-leaders/1742730.html', 'dateModified': '2013-09-04T21:43:37+00:00', 'datePublished': '2013-09-02T00:00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class=""col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-8 pull-left bottom-offset content-offset"">\n<div class=""intro intro--bold"">\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=""article-content"" class=""content-floated-wrap fb-quotable"">\n<div class=""wsw"">\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on four members of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group which has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization since 1997.

Karl	Camorra	Organization	https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2121.aspx	"New Sanctions Announced Against the Camorra and the Brothers' Circle

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five members of the Italian Camorra, including the mob boss Marco Di Lauro and the fugitive Mario Riccio, as well as two businesses linked to individuals acting on behalf of a key member of the Brothers' Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network. These Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continue to use various methods to conceal the proceeds earned from their illicit activities and maintain access to the international financial system. Today's actions are the latest in the Treasury Department's use of executive authorities to expose, undermine, and disrupt these criminal activities which include: money laundering, extortion, drug trafficking, kidnapping and counterfeiting.

""Today's action against key members of criminal organizations that engage in serious crimes around the world is a continuation of our systematic effort to expose and disrupt these dangerous groups and protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit activity,"" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

President Obama identified the Camorra, and the Brothers' Circle, along with the Yakuza and the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) in July 2011, and he charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against their members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations.

Today's action freezes any assets these individuals and businesses may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. To date, the Treasury Department has designated 34 individuals and entities related to TCOs and has exposed their activity ranging from Europe to Asia to the Middle East. Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as identify other significant TCOs, such as MS-13 which was named in October 2012, in order to expose and disrupt their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from abuse.

The Camorra

The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Italian law enforcement has conducted multiple operations this year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of 450 million euros from the Casalesi clan in June. To date, Treasury has designated nine individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.

The Camorra members designated today have all played a role in the recent inter-clan violence that has wreaked havoc on northern Naples. In October 2012, all five were identified by Italian authorities as involved in the murder of a bystander to the feud. Marco Di Lauro has been on Italy's Most Wanted List since 2004 for mafia-related activities. Mario Riccio is involved in a drug trafficking business that nets tens of millions of euros every year. Until his capture in January, Antonio Mennetta was in charge of a group responsible for assassinating enemies of a young splinter clan supported by Di Lauro, the ""Vanella Grassi"" or ""Girati"". Mariano Abete, also currently in jail, was arrested for mafia associated activity and conspiracy to deal drugs. Rosario Guarino, implicated in a dozen murders, was arrested in November 2012 for mafia associated activities and drug trafficking. Each of these five individuals were designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Camorra.

The Brothers' Circle

The Brothers' Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has designated 16 individuals connected with the Brothers' Circle, including both Brothers' Circle members and their subordinates, under E.O. 13581. These designated individuals include key member Vladislav Leontyev, as well as two individuals acting for or on his behalf, Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian. Leontyev, Manuylov, and Shaybazian were designated by Treasury in February 2012. Today, Treasury is taking action against the companies Avuar OOO and Guga Arm SRO because they are owned or controlled by Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian, respectively. Aleksandr Manuylov is the sole director of Avuar OOO while Lazar Shaybazian is the director, sole board member, and 100 percent owner of Guga Arm SRO.

Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as identify other significant TCOs, such as MS-13 which was named in October 2012, in order to expose and disrupt their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from abuse.\n\nThe Camorra\n\nThe Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Italian law enforcement has conducted multiple operations this year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of 450 million euros from the Casalesi clan in June. To date, Treasury has designated nine individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.\n\nThe Camorra members designated today have all played a role in the recent inter-clan violence that has wreaked havoc on northern Naples. In October 2012, all five were identified by Italian authorities as involved in the murder of a bystander to the feud. Marco Di Lauro has been on Italy\'s Most Wanted List since 2004 for mafia-related activities. Mario Riccio is involved in a drug trafficking business that nets tens of millions of euros every year. Until his capture in January, Antonio Mennetta was in charge of a group responsible for assassinating enemies of a young splinter clan supported by Di Lauro, the ""Vanella Grassi"" or ""Girati"". Mariano Abete, also currently in jail, was arrested for mafia associated activity and conspiracy to deal drugs. Rosario Guarino, implicated in a dozen murders, was arrested in November 2012 for mafia associated activities and drug trafficking. Each of these five individuals were designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Camorra.\n\nThe Brothers\' Circle\n\nThe Brothers\' Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has designated 16 individuals connected with the Brothers\' Circle, including both Brothers\' Circle members and their subordinates, under E.O. 13581. These designated individuals include key member Vladislav Leontyev, as well as two individuals acting for or on his behalf, Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian. Leontyev, Manuylov, and Shaybazian were designated by Treasury in February 2012. Today, Treasury is taking action against the companies Avuar OOO and Guga Arm SRO because they are owned or controlled by Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian, respectively.

Shakshi	Santos Isidro RIVERA MARADIAGA	Individual	https://internationaltransnationalcriminaldefenselawyers.wordpress.com/tag/santos-isidro-rivera-maradiaga/	"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on September 19, 2013 released the following:

“Action Sanctions Individuals and Businesses Linked to Los Cachiros

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of seven individuals and five businesses tied to the Honduran drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros. The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization: Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros). In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization’s drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.

“Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are – drug traffickers and money launderers.”

Today’s action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.

“Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers. We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,” said DEA’s Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.

This action marks the U.S. Government’s second action against Los Cachiros in four months. In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.

In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime. Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.

The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization. The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Two top Brazilian businessmen have been arrested as part of a major investigation into corruption at state-owned oil giant Petrobras.

Marcelo Odebrecht heads the Odebrecht group - Latin America's largest construction conglomerate.

Also detained is Otavio Azevedo, boss of Andrade Gutierrez, another top construction company.

Investigators allege firms paid corrupt officials in order to get lucrative Petrobras contracts.

The scandal has rocked Brazil's governing Workers' Party, with top politicians accused of taking bribes.

But President Dilma Rousseff, who chaired Petrobras when much of the corruption is believed to have taken place, has been cleared of involvement.

Odebrecht is one of Brazil's most successful construction firms - with a huge presence in countries like Angola and Mozambique.

Among its many works is the Sao Paulo stadium used in the opening of last year's Fifa World Cup.

Just last month its president took pride in the fact that his company had not been implicated in the wide-ranging investigations into Petrobras.

But today Marcelo Odebrecht is under police custody.

Even before the Petrobras scandal, Odebrecht was accused by critics of benefiting from close relations with the Brazilian government.

The accusation led Brazil's investment bank BNDES to reveal details of how much money it lent to Odebrecht to build infrastructure projects in Cuba and Angola.

Now Odebrecht is at the centre of Brazil's costliest corruption scandal.

Odebrecht had been named by former Petrobras executives as one of the companies that allegedly paid bribes in exchange for contracts with the oil firm, but until now the firm had not been targeted by investigators.

Odebrecht said in a statement (in Portuguese) its offices had been raided, and arrests had been made, but called them ""unnecessary"" as it had been co-operating with the authorities.

Andrade Gutierrez also said it was co-operating, according to the Reuters news agency, but had no connection to the investigation into Petrobras.

Announcing the arrests, a police spokesman said the operation sent a ""clear message"" no one would escape their attention, no matter how big they were.

Petrobras' investments alone represent 2% of Brazil's gross national product, and its downturn has harmed a national economy struggling as a result of low commodity prices."

Shakshi	Esperanza Caridad MARADIAGA LOPEZ	Individual	https://ofac-sdn-list-removal.com/tag/esperanza-caridad-maradiaga-lopez/	"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on September 19, 2013 released the following:

“Action Sanctions Individuals and Businesses Linked to Los Cachiros

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of seven individuals and five businesses tied to the Honduran drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros. The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization: Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros). In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization’s drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.

“Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are – drug traffickers and money launderers.”

Today’s action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.

“Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers. We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,” said DEA’s Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.

This action marks the U.S. Government’s second action against Los Cachiros in four months. In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.

In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime. Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.

The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization. The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.  Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization:  Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros).  In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization’s drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.</p>\n\n<p>“Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin.  “Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are – drug traffickers and money launderers.”</p>\n\n<p>Today’s action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.</p>\n\n<p>“Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers.  We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs.  The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,” said DEA’s Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.</p>\n\n<p>This action marks the U.S. Government’s second action against Los Cachiros in four months.  In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act.  Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel.  Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America.  It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.</p>\n\n<p>In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime.  Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.</p>\n\n<p>The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization.  The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).</p>\n\n<p>Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000.  OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide.  Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties.  Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million.  Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million.  Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.</p>\n\n<p>For a chart relating to today’s actions click <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/20130919_los_cachiros.pdf"">here</a>”</p>\n\n<p>————————————————————–</p>\n\n<p><a href=""http://mcnabbassociates.com/ofac-litigation-video.html#OFAC-SDN-List-Removal"">OFAC SDN List Removal</a></p>\n\n<p>————————————————————–</p>\n\n<p>To find additional global criminal news, please read <a href=""http://paper.li/douglasmcnabb/globalcriminaldefense"">The Global Criminal Defense Daily</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Douglas McNabb and other members of the U.S. law firm practice and write and/or report extensively on matters involving Federal Criminal Defense, INTERPOL Red Notice Removal, International Extradition Defense, OFAC SDN Sanctions Removal, International Criminal Court Defense, and US Seizure of Non-Resident, Foreign-Owned Assets.

The 29-year-old otherwise known as 'Joe Banana' had been on the run since March 2011 and was found in a secret hideout in Arzano just north of the southern coastal metropolis.

He was one of five fugitives whose names and photographs were released in October in an invitation to the local population for information about their whereabouts. Interior Minister Annamaria Cancellieri congratulated the national police chief Antonio Manganelli on the arrest.

Sebastien	Roman Abramovich	individual	https://www.fr24news.com/a/2020/09/leaks-show-chelsea-owner-abramovich-funded-group-of-israeli-settlers-roman-abramovich.html	"Companies controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich have donated tens of millions of pounds to a highly controversial Israeli settler group accused of displacing Palestinian families from Jerusalem, according to documents leaked and viewed by BBC News Arabic .

The Russian billionaire oligarch, who obtained Israeli citizenship in 2018, has been a passionate philanthropist in Israel, donating huge sums to research and development projects and investing in local businesses.

However, four companies he owns or controls in the British Virgin Islands have contributed more than $ 100million (£ 74million) to Elad, a group that supports settlements in the Palestinian neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem called Silwan. , BBC News Arabic reported.

These numbers would mean that the owner of the British football club was the biggest donor in the past 15 years to Elad, a Hebrew word which means “the everlasting faith of God”, he added.

The group, which also enjoys support from the Israeli government, has sought to strengthen the Jewish presence in the Silwan neighborhood at the expense of its Arab residents.

Elad manages an archaeological site in Silwan called the City of David which has become a huge tourist attraction. The excavation has been criticized by European Union diplomats as seeking to ignore the diversity of the ancient city’s history in favor of an “exclusively Jewish narrative, while detaching the place from its Palestinian environment.”

The City of David website said it was “determined to carry on King David’s legacy as well as reveal and connect people to the glorious past of ancient Jerusalem through four key initiatives: archaeological excavations, tourism development, educational programs and residential revitalization ”.

Elad, similar to other settler organizations, has grown by buying Palestinian homes and using controversial Israeli laws that allow the state to take control of Palestinian property. About 450 settlers currently live alongside nearly 10,000 Palestinians in Silwan.

BBC News Arabic uncovered Abramovich’s donations by going through thousands of leaked documents detailing $ 2 billion (£ 1.55 billion) in potentially corrupt transactions that were swept away by the US financial system.

More than 2,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) filed with the U.S. government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) were disclosed to Buzzfeed News, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, of which the BBC is a member. .

Banks and other financial institutions file PADs when they believe a customer is using their services for potential criminal activity. While an SAR by itself doesn’t force a bank to cease doing business with the customer in question, it points to contentious actions hidden in the financial world.

The leaks, known as the FinCEN files, have already rocked the financial industry, with allegations of dirty money flowing freely around the world. Shares in the banking sector fell on Monday. Other prominent figures, such as former Trump political strategist Paul Manafort, have also been identified in an SAR.

The BBC report did not say whether Abramovich companies or donations were included in an SAR, nor did it charge Abramovich or the companies with breaking the law in any country. Abramovich was the subject of a SAR in 2016 concerning offshore shell companies linked to his football business.

In its report, which aired on its flagship Panorama program, BBC Arabic quoted Elad as saying they follow all regulations of Israeli nonprofits but would not confirm whether Abramovich was a donor.

The news channel quoted an Abramovich spokesman as saying: “[he] is a committed and generous supporter of Israeli and Jewish civil society, and over the past 20 years has donated over five hundred million dollars to support healthcare, science, education, and communities Jews in Israel and around the world.

Settlement activities on occupied lands are considered illegal under international law. Israel argues that all of Jerusalem is its sovereign territory, although this claim is largely unrecognized.

Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital encouraged the Israeli government and the powerful settler movement. US Ambassador to Israel and staunch supporter of the settlements, David Friedman, took part in an opening ceremony in the City of David."

Shakshi	Mario RICCIO	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26031009	"Published

Police in Naples have detained Camorra clan boss Mariano Riccio, aged 23 and described as one of the 100 most wanted men in Italy.

He is facing a 16-year jail sentence for drug trafficking and is seen by investigators as a key figure in a war for control of the mafia drug trade.

Riccio was seized outside the city and police said he did not resist arrest.

Separately, 29 suspected Camorra members have been arrested in Rome in connection with fraud and extortion.

They have been linked to the Zaza clan in the western Fuorigrotta area of Naples.

The Camorra is a formidable mafia network based in the Naples area, which is believed to have extended its influence to Rome and as far north as Florence.

Mario Riccio, believed by police to head another clan called the Amato-Pagato, has been on the run since 2011. He was reportedly arrested at a house north of Naples, where he was staying with his wife and baby daughter.

He is wanted for his alleged role in a drug feud in the Scampia area of northern Naples.

Beyond its role in the drugs trade, the Camorra has been active in illegal waste dumping around the city and the government said last month it would consider sending in the army to tackle the problem.

Mariano Abete was the son for former boss Argangelo Abete and was known in the Italian media as “ Baby Boss ” taking over the family at age twenty one. He took over as head of the mafia family after his fathers arrest and the murder of his uncle. Mariano was now leading the family in a bloody war over drug turf against the Scissionisti clan a rival Camorra faction. The turf war has claimed the lives of dozens of known mobsters from both clans in recent months. Despite his age Italian police say that Mariano was a very powerful and dangerous mobster.

“Mariano Abete Arrest”

Abete was found hiding in a small hidden room in his mothers house in Naples. Police began to break down the wall when his mother intervened begging police not to hurt him and opening the secret doorway to the room. The room was nothing more then a small space hidden between two walls that was accessed by a movable wall operated by remote control. The small space contained only a canister of oxygen , mattress, pillow, and a crucifix.

Archangel Abete sometimes referred to as super boss because he led a splinter factions rebellion against the ruling family of the Neapolitan Mafia. Being the son of the so called super boss made Mariano mafia royalty says Italian police. Mariano is also the newphew of a notorious mafia don murdered in September in an ambush as revenge for the murder of a rival mafioso known was “Wooden Hands”. The mobster got the nickname because he had lost both hands years ago when a home made bomb exploded and now wore prosthetics. The hit on Mariano’s uncle was the latest murder in the bloody turf war.

Camorra mob hit caught on security video

April 15, 2013, 6:27 am

A security camera at a cheese factory allegedly captured a suspected Camorra or Neapolitan Mafia hitman gunning down a rival mobster. Police claim the security camera footage shows Gianluca Troise pursuing rival Naples mafia clan member Luigi Felaco , bringing him down with a gunshot , then chasing him down finishing him off with multiple shots to the head. The hit took place last December and the recent 20 second security camera footage obtained by police has lead to the arrest of Troise. Police say they believe the mafia hit was part of a ongoing turf war for control of international drug markets in Naples, Italy.

US targets leaders of violent street gang
By ALICIA A. CALDWELL Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The government on Wednesday designated six leaders of the violent street gang MS-13 as international criminals, stepping up a crackdown on the sprawling U.S. and Central American gang's finances.

The Treasury Department in October designated MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, as an international criminal organization. The Obama administration said that makes the gang subject to penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and gives the U.S. an opportunity to hinder MS-13's ability to funnel money to its leaders in El Salvador or launder criminal proceeds through otherwise legitimate businesses.

Adding the names of six of the gang's purported leaders allows the U.S. to target their bank accounts individually.

The men added to the transnational criminal organization designation are: Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon, 28; Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 37; Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa-Larios, 39; Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, 44; Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35; and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34.

All are from El Salvador. Turcios, Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios have been indicted in the United States on criminal charges. Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios are jailed in El Salvador and Turcios' whereabouts are unknown. Federal court records do not list attorneys of any of the three men."

Sebastien	Marcelo Odebrecht	individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39194395	"Published

For years, Latin America's construction giant, Odebrecht, built some of the region's most crucial infrastructure projects.

But then it became well-known for another superlative: its involvement in one of the biggest corruption cases in history.

In 2016, the Brazilian-based group signed what has been described as the world's largest leniency deal with US and Swiss authorities, in which it confessed to corruption and paid $2.6bn (£2.1bn) in fines.

Seventy-seven company executives agreed to plea bargains with Brazilian authorities, and their statements to investigators were made public.

Their revelations had strong political and economic repercussions throughout Latin America.

What is Odebrecht and why is it important?

It's not a brand many outside Latin America will recognise, but Grupo Odebrecht is the region's largest construction conglomerate.

It started out as a small family construction group in the 1940s founded by Brazilians of German origin. It grew quickly and at its peak, around 2010, the company had 181,000 employees across 21 countries.

Its focus is on building large projects, such as Caracas' metro, a port in Cuba and much of the infrastructure used by Brazil in the 2014 World Cup, including some of the stadiums.

The company is also one of the biggest donors to politicians in Brazil.

What has the company done that is illegal?

Odebrecht is one of the firms that have been caught in Operacao Lava Jato, Brazil's corruption probe into the state oil giant Petrobras. Dozens of companies acknowledged paying bribes to politicians and officials in exchange for contracts with Petrobras.

In June 2015, the group's chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, the grandson of its founder, was arrested. Since then, he and dozens of other company executives have been jailed.

In 2016, all of them signed deals with Brazilian investigators, agreeing to confess to crimes and to identify corrupt officials in exchange for shorter prison sentences.

Odebrecht executives have confessed to paying bribes in exchange for contracts not only in Brazil, but in various parts of the world. An international taskforce of investigators is looking into bribery in 10 countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

In December 2016, Odebrecht signed a leniency deal with authorities in the US and Switzerland, agreeing to pay $2.6bn in fines for its past mistakes - the largest sum of its kind in the world.

The company also tried to settle cases with other governments so that it would be allowed to tender for future major infrastructure projects.

What have Odebrecht executives confessed to?

The most explosive statements came from the former boss, Marcelo Odebrecht, who said that part of the $48m he donated to Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer's campaign in the 2014 Brazilian presidential election was illegal.

Outside Brazil, revelations made by Odebrecht executive Jorge Barata prompted investigators in Peru to issue an arrest warrant against former President Alejandro Toledo, who is currently considered a fugitive.

All those mentioned in the statements have strongly denied any wrongdoing, and have accused Odebrecht executives of lying.

Are these confessions reliable?

Not always. It is hard for investigators to determine whether those arrested are actually confessing to real crimes, or whether they are telling a story that prosecutors want to hear in exchange for shorter prison sentences.

Plea bargains can be very rewarding for those who sign them. Some of the Petrobras executives who signed such deals in 2014 are now out of prison and serving their sentences at homes, instead of spending years in jail.

On the other hand, plea bargains have been instrumental in bringing to justice powerful people who would otherwise never have been caught."

Shakshi	Bulut YAYLA	Individual	http://infomobile.w2eu.net/2013/06/02/urgent-announcement-concerning-the-case-of-the-enforced-disappearance-of-bulut-yayla/	"Athens, 2.6.2013

On Thursday 30.05.2013 at 9.30pm, Bulut Yayla, a 24 years old, Turkish political refugee was detained, beaten and violently abducted by people aboard a private car at the center of Athens – Greece.
Through eyewitness testimonies and research conducted by the victim’s comrades and lawyers, it was revealed that the license plate of the car in question belongs to the Greek Police. However, the police still claim they have nothing to do with the incident, despite the persistent and constant allegations of his comrades, lawyers and political actors.
Yesterday 01.06.2013, Bulut Yayla’s family announced that he is kept in custody at Istanbul’s Antiterrorist Unit. According to the victim’s allegations, a group of people speaking Greek, pushed him inside a car, using extreme violence, shutting his mouth and eyes. Then he was transferred by another car by a second group of people speaking Greek and Turkish and then a third group who spoke Turkish and English.
During his captivity Y.B. suffered violence, abuse and ill-treatment. On Friday noon, Bulut Yayla was delivered to the Police Department of Edirne from where he was transferred to Istanbul’s Antiterrorist Unit.
Bulut Yayla’s enforced disappearance is proof of the most obscure aspect of state fascism. The partner authorities of the Greek and Turkish states used brutal force and arbitrary violence, as if legal order and humans as subjects of law are non-existent. The full depreciation of political asylum processes, of extradition and deportation, the negation of judicial review and the ill-treatment of humans as if they have no voice, can create only fear, insecurity and anger to every citizen.
It is not the first time that the state authorities, under the pretext of the “war against terrorism” cooperate at international level with the goal to deny every sense of human dignity.
As lawyers, we do know that the laws and the legal procedures are under threat and will always be by the state authority itself.
In such cases of extremely unlawful para-state acts, we declare that we stand in solidarity with every victim of state arbitrariness.
We will insist in giving voice to the unfairly treated that the state wants to be silenced, to bring to the public sphere those that the obscure transnational collaborations want to wipe out; and reveal those who are responsible and hidden behind the opacity, the cover ups and lies.
We do not aim to restore legitimacy given that Yayla Bulut’s future is already known and the harm to democratic rights is irretrievable.
We denounce the Greek Police which consistently and systematically obstructs the submission of asylum claims and the asylum procedure. Yayla Bulut tried, in vain, to submit an asylum claim despite the fact that he is a political refugee and a victim of torture in Turkey due to his political convictions.
We denounce the government and its secret international agreements that led to the systematic persecution of Turkish political refugees through international arrest warrants. Now they circumvent and ridicule Justice that tried to stop cases of ungrounded extradition requests.
We aim to protect our rights and liberties and our personal dignity against a system in decline; a deteriorating system that moves from the violation of liberties to enforced disappearances and abductions of people, breaching any legitimacy whatsoever and outwardly jeopardizing even the minimum guarantees of respect for society."

Darya	Wells Fargo	company	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/business/wells-fargo-federal-reserve.html	"Last year, a longtime Wells Fargo investor, Gerald R. Armstrong, submitted a shareholder proposal calling for the bank’s directors to be replaced. His proposal was voted down. Mr. Armstrong welcomed Friday’s news. “I hope they bring in some very effective new directors,” he said.

A review that Wells Fargo’s board commissioned last year, conducted by four directors and the outside law firm Shearman & Sterling, found that lax internal oversight allowed problems to fester for years.

The Fed, in letters sent Friday to Wells Fargo board members, leveled harsh criticism on their oversight of the bank and made clear that more changes need to happen quickly.

“Your performance in addressing these problems is an example of ineffective oversight that is not consistent with the Federal Reserve’s expectations for a firm of WFC’s size and scope of operations,” wrote Michael S. Gibson, the Fed’s head of banking supervision, in a letter to John G. Stumpf, the bank’s former chief executive. Mr. Stumpf retired under pressure in the wake of the scandal with a pretax payout of more than $80 million in stock options and other compensation.

“The bank is lucky it is too big to shut down,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “A smaller bank might have lost its banking licenses.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605056011398-12dbf1404a9141a5', 'domain': 'nytimes.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/business/wells-fargo-federal-reserve.html', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/business/wells-fargo-federal-reserve.html', 'author': 'Emily Flitter', 'images': ['https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/03/business/03WELLSFARGO/merlin_111916157_1fbd13e0-4776-4640-b820-14d68b459ffc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'], 'headline': 'Federal Reserve Shackles Wells Fargo After Fraud Scandal', 'mainImage': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/03/business/03WELLSFARGO/03WELLSFARGO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&sig=0x3c114bba786fbc3eec64cbac82c10e2a', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Last year, a longtime Wells Fargo investor, Gerald R.

Ms Patel said the threat level had been raised from substantial to severe meaning that an attack is highly likely. Ms Patel added that this was connected to the recent attacks that had occurred in European countries.  She said: ""The British public should be alert but not alarmed and this is a precautionary measure following the terrible incidents we have seen in France last week and the events we saw in Austria last night.  ""The first and most important duty of the Government is obviously to protect the British public and we are doing that and will continue to do that through the measures and tools we have put in place in terms of dealing with terrorists and terrorist activity.  ""At this particular stage, if the public has any concerns I would ask that they report anything of concern that they may have to the police.  ""But as I have said, this is a precautionary measure in light of recent events we have seen.""  DON'T MISS: Austria shooting: Video shows police swoop as multiple shots fired  Ms Patel was then asked what the Government is doing to ensure the safety of the public at this stage.  She said: ""Well first of all the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre is an independent body and they have made the judgement in light of recent events we have seen in France and Austria.  ""In terms of counter activity, we work with our outstanding intelligence and police forces and intelligence agencies to put the protective and preventative measures in place, that will continue.  ""Of course now the public will see more visible policing across the country and that is right in light of the threat going up but as I have said the public should not be alarmed.  This announcement comes after Austrian police were forced to respond to multiple gun attacks in Vienna yesterday evening.  The attack killed four people with a total of 22 people injured.  A gunman shot dead by police was identified as a 20-year-old Islamist terrorist who was released early from prison in December.  Two men and two women died of their gunshot wounds after a gunman opened fire at six locations in the city centre on Monday.  Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress.  He added: ""It was clearly an attack driven by hatred of our way of life, our democracy...a repulsive terror attack."""
