**First step: double-checking**

In the Git repo, there are files of data called ./adverse/nan.csv, ./nonadverse/nan.csv that have not been double-checked. We double-check it before 22 November 2020:
- Shakshi: double check ./adverse/nan.csv, lines 0 to 125
- Carel: double check ./adverse/nan.csv, lines 126 to 250
- Wanting: double check ./nonadverse/nan.csv, lines 0 to 125
- Sebastien: double check ./nonadverse/nan.csv, lines 126 to 184 + ./adverse/nan.csv lines 251 to 319

In addition, each one of us should look into one model that could be applied to the data.

**Second step: preprocessing by converting text to vectors**

Shakshi will convert articles to vectors, using Word2vec and other algos. This will take place from November 23 to November 29

**Third step: testing different models**

This will take place starting on November 30. The models that can be trained are various:
- LSTM
- neural network
- classification using SVM, ...
- others

Each person should come up with a different model to try and test.

The training data will be 80%  of what we have, and testing will be on 20%.


**Fourth step: optimization**

From the previous step, someone will work on finding the best parameters for optimization.
