Shakshi	Imran Khan	Individual	aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/28/pakistan-to-hold-talks-with-india-if-siege-on-kashmir-is-lifted	"Imran Khan says he is open to dialogue if Kashmiris are given the right to self-determination as per the UN resolutions.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has reiterated that he is prepared to hold talks with neighbouring India only if it lifts its “military siege” on Indian-administered Kashmir and gives its residents the right to self-determination.

Khan made the remarks during a short video address released on Tuesday to coincide with the anniversary of the day Indian security forces entered the part of Kashmir it administers in 1947, two months after both India and Pakistan gained independence from the British.

In his speech, Khan said he would engage in dialogue with India only if it took steps to reverse what Pakistan terms New Delhi’s “occupation” of India’s only Muslim-majority region.

“I am ready [for talks], but for that, you will need to end the military siege that you have imposed on Kashmir, and the second thing is that you will need to give Kashmiris the right to self-determination as per the United Nations’ resolutions,” said Khan.

Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer separate portions of it, divided by a Line of Control, across which a tenuous ceasefire has been in place since 2003.


In August 2019, India revoked a constitutional provision that had given Indian-administered Kashmir a measure of autonomy, bringing it into the country’s administrative and governance mainstream.

The move was accompanied by the influx of tens of thousands of troops into the territory, where an armed separatist movement has raged for years.

A curfew was imposed across the mountainous Himalayan territory, with severe restrictions on public gatherings, communication and other civil liberties and hundreds of people arrested.

The restrictions have continued after the coronavirus pandemic erupted in March.

In his comments on Tuesday, Khan decried what he termed a “military siege” of Kashmir’s citizens in Indian-administered Kashmir.

“They are neither Indian citizens, and neither do they have the right of self-determination that was given by the United Nations Security Council,” he said.

In 1948, the UN Security Council passed a resolution mandating that both sides cease hostilities to pave the way for a plebiscite where Kashmiris would be given the right to choose between joining either Pakistan or India.

But New Delhi has continued to tighten its control over the Muslim-majority region with a large military presence and a series of legislation aimed at suppressing the separatist voices.

Khan’s statement on Tuesday coincided with India enacting new laws that allow any Indian national to buy land in Indian-administered Kashmir, spurring allegations about New Delhi planning a demographic change in the region.

Carel	DNB	Organization	https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-electronic-money-scandinavia	"Norway’s largest bank DNB proposes to stop using cash as a means of payment in the country.

According to the DNB bank’s executive Trond Bentestuen, more that half of all cash transfers in the country are made without the banks’ control, and so could be used for illegal purposes. He commented to local news media outlet VG.no:

“Today, there is approximately 50 billion kroner in circulation and [the country’s central bank] Norges Bank can only account for 40 percent of its use. That means that 60 percent of money usage is outside of any control. We believe that is due to under-the-table money and laundering.”

Norway has already became one of the leading countries to propose using electronic money. Several banks have already refused to accept or offer cash transactions in their branches all over the country.

Sweden and Denmark to become cashless

The widespread adoption of mobile payment solutions and bankcards turned out to be more popular among Swedes than old-fashioned cash payments. A study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has shown that Sweden may become the world’s first cashless country.

Niklas Arvidsson, an industrial technology and management researcher at KTH, commented that now of all Swedish crowns in circulation, “only somewhere between 40 and 60 percent is actually in regular circulation”.

Moreover, Bengt Nilervall from the Swedish Federation of Trade explained that moving to a cashless society is safer and saves money. He adds:

“So Swedes feel confident paying electronically.”

The Chamber of Commerce of Denmark has also proposed to allow most retailers (except for essential services like hospitals, post offices, etc.) to make all money transactions electronically and ban cash. Moreover, the Danish government has “set a 2030 deadline to completely do away with paper money.”

Norwegian banks refuse to work with cash

Another of Norway’s largest banks, Nordea, has also refused to accept cash in November 2015. It left only one branch in Oslo Central Station to continue handling cash, thus enabling customers to still be able to get cash via banks ATMs.

Åse Dahl, manager of the Nordea bank branch at Oslo Central Station, said:

“The whole of society is going in this direction. The other banks will follow – it’s just a matter of time.”

However, to date, the Finance Ministry of Norway has no plans to change its laws, at least for now, as there are still many people, including the elderly, who still want to use cash.

Is this a chance for Bitcoin?

It is. However, as Norway is not an EU country, the local legal approach towards Bitcoin differs from most neighbour countries that follow the decision of European Court of Justice that Bitcoin ‘ be exempted from VAT ’.

In 2014 some local banks were closing bank accounts of Bitcoin-related companies, like Länsförsäkringar that said they did not want any customers using Bitcoin or Nordea that closed the accounts of Bitcoinbolag. Also Bitcoin exchange into the local Norwegian krone (NOR) is subject to a 25% VAT.

Nevertheless, Denmark and Sweden are EU countries. Also in May 2015, the Tax Authority of Sweden published guidelines for assessing Income Tax on Bitcoin mining. The guidelines state that the only prohibited activity that includes the usage of Bitcoins in the buying and selling of scrap metal."

Sebastien			https://hyperallergic.com/597566/the-british-museum-isnt-doing-enough-to-fight-illegal-antiquities-trafficking/	"In September, the British Museum announced that it had helped British police identify and return a 4,400-year-old sculpture to Iraq. The object is a limestone plaque that would have originally lined the wall of a temple in the region of Sumer, now southern Iraq. The plaque was previously unknown, presumably looted from a site in Iraq and smuggled out of the country. It was identified after being posted for sale on an online website, TimeLine Auctions, in May of 2019. TimeLine insists that they did nothing wrong, that they checked sources such as the Art Loss Register. But this is apparent due diligence is just a façade. As any experienced auction house would know, objects looted from the ground would not show up in a database of known items reported missing.

The announcement was merely the latest in a series of such events over the past several years. The British Museum is, in its own words, “the main advisory body in the UK in the event of any enquiries over illicit trafficking or export licensing of antiquities,” working with the Metropolitan Police (aka Scotland Yard), British customs, and other government agencies. Earlier this year they announced the return of a sculpture looted from the National Museum of Afghanistan in the early 1990s (again after being offered for sale by TimeLine Auctions). Last year, it was nine terracotta heads from Buddhist sculptures smuggled from Afghanistan, a 3,100 year old kudurru (a stone recording a land grant) looted from southern Iraq, and 156 cuneiform tablets, “the largest such group to be seized in the UK and returned to Iraq.” (This month, the Guardian reported that the museum has identified six glazed tiles smuggled out of Uzbekistan.

Returning stolen artifacts to their countries of origin is a good thing. It reverses the drain on cultural heritage that occurs during conflicts and builds up good will between countries. But how much is this impacting the illegal antiquities trade in general? Several recent studies suggest the trade continues on a massive scale, despite the work of governments, law enforcement, and institutions such as the British Museum. The studies also show that antiquities traffickers favor coins and other small finds — items of little value individually but that add up in bulk, and that can be smuggled easily — not the unique sculptural pieces typically announced by the British Museum. While they may grab headlines, the museum’s efforts are a drop in the bucket.

Ironically, Dr St John Simpson, the British Museum curator most directly involved with the identification and return of these trafficked artifacts, has consistently downplayed the level of antiquities looting and smuggling going on today. Simpson insists that most antiquities looting in Iraq ended in the immediate aftermath of the 2003 US invasion, despite Iraqi claims to the contrary. He has also suggested that no artifacts can be proven to have entered the UK from Syria in the last nine years while dismissing the overwhelming evidence of large-scale looting during that country’s civil war.

It is also ironic to see the British Museum at the forefront of cultural heritage repatriation. The museum is infamous for failing to seriously address how it acquired much of its own collection — most notably the Parthenon sculptures (known as the “Elgin marbles”), but also the Benin bronzes, the Maqdala collection, and many other artifacts. “The world’s largest receiver of stolen goods” is what a leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, called the museum in the Guardian last November. A day after the Guardian article, Robertson’s book Who Owns History? Elgin’s Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure came out – and so did a British Museum blog post by St John Simpson on the British Museum’s work “identifying and returning looted objects.” The timing is suggestive. Does the museum use its work policing the antiquities market to distract from its historic role in acquiring looted and smuggled objects?

Museum public relations presents its work in identifying trafficked antiquities as an altruistic enterprise. “The British Museum is absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage,” director Hartwig Fischer assures the public in the museum’s press release for the Sumerian plaque. Earlier this year, Fischer praised the museum’s efforts “in the reconstruction of the rich cultural heritage of Afghanistan after decades of conflict, destruction and loss.” What goes unmentioned is that the British Museum receives many benefits from this and other cultural heritage efforts. For instance, it gets to put many of the trafficked artifacts it identifies on temporary display before handing them over to their source countries. (The Sumerian plaque is currently on temporary display at the British Museum.) And throughout, it gets glowing press coverage.

The British Museum could use its work identifying smuggled antiquities to take a thoughtful look at its own past. Instead, we get empty clichés. The reality is that cultural heritage is determined by the powerful for their own benefit, whether they are governments, wealthy individuals — or institutions like the British Museum."

The object is a limestone plaque that would have originally lined the wall of a temple in the region of Sumer, now southern Iraq.

It reverses the drain on cultural heritage that occurs during conflicts and builds up good will between countries. But how much is this impacting the illegal antiquities trade in general? Several <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/art-world/germany-illicit-antiquities-1826016"">recent studies suggest</a> the trade <a href=""https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Site-Level-Market-Model-of-the-Antiquities-Trade-Greenland-Marrone/7f98d99ee7eed82abba4621042e0c44708dcd7d4"">continues on a massive scale</a>, despite the work of governments, law enforcement, and institutions such as the British Museum. The studies also show that antiquities traffickers <a href=""https://traffickingculture.org/publications/brodie-n-and-isber-sabrine-2018-the-illegal-excavation-and-trade-of-syrian-cultural-objects-a-view-from-the-ground-journal-of-field-archaeology-431-74-84/"">favor coins and other small finds</a> — items of little value individually but that add up in bulk, and that can be smuggled easily — not the unique sculptural pieces typically announced by the British Museum. While they may grab headlines, the museum’s efforts are a drop in the bucket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, <a href=""https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG78612"">Dr St John Simpson</a>, the British Museum curator most directly involved with the identification and return of these trafficked artifacts, has consistently downplayed the level of antiquities looting and smuggling going on today. Simpson insists that <a href=""https://culturalpropertynews.org/st-john-simpson-interview-afghanistan-repatriation-daesh-database-archaeology-and-the-illicid-report/"">most antiquities looting in Iraq ended in the immediate aftermath of the 2003 US invasion</a>, despite <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iraq-looting-heritage-culture-coronavirus"">Iraqi claims to the contrary</a>. He has also suggested that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/uk-curator-criticises-misleading-reports-about-looted-items"">no artifacts can be proven to have entered the UK from Syria in the last nine years</a> while dismissing the overwhelming evidence of large-scale looting during that country’s civil war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also ironic to see the British Museum at the forefront of cultural heritage repatriation. The museum is infamous for failing to seriously address how it acquired much of its own collection —\xa0 most notably the Parthenon sculptures (known as the “Elgin marbles”), but also <a href=""https://bookshop.org/books/the-brutish-museums-the-benin-bronzes-colonial-violence-and-cultural-restitution/9780745341767"">the Benin bronzes</a>, the <a href=""https://www.britishmuseum.org/about-us/british-museum-story/objects-news/maqdala-collection"">Maqdala collection</a>, and many other artifacts. “The world’s largest receiver of stolen goods” is what a leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, called the museum <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/british-museum-is-worlds-largest-receiver-of-stolen-goods-says-qc"">in the <em>Guardian</em> last November</a>. A day after the <em>Guardian</em> article, Robertson’s book <a href=""https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/who-owns-history""><em>Who Owns History? Elgin’s Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure</em></a> came out – and so did a British Museum blog post by St John Simpson on <a href=""https://blog.britishmuseum.org/art-in-crisis-identifying-and-returning-looted-objects/"">the British Museum’s work “identifying and returning looted objects.”</a> The timing is suggestive. Does the museum use its work policing the antiquities market to distract from its historic role in acquiring looted and smuggled objects?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Museum public relations presents its work in identifying trafficked antiquities as an altruistic enterprise. “The British Museum is absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage,” director Hartwig Fischer assures the public in the museum’s press release for the Sumerian plaque. Earlier this year, Fischer praised the museum’s efforts “in the reconstruction of the rich cultural heritage of Afghanistan after decades of conflict, destruction and loss.” What goes unmentioned is that the British Museum receives many benefits from this and other cultural heritage efforts. For instance, it gets to put many of the trafficked artifacts it identifies on temporary display before handing them over to their source countries. (The Sumerian plaque is currently on temporary display at the British Museum.) And throughout, it gets glowing press coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British Museum could use its work identifying smuggled antiquities to take a thoughtful look at its own past. Instead, we get empty clichés. The reality is that cultural heritage is determined by the powerful for their own benefit, whether they are governments, wealthy individuals — or institutions like the British Museum.</p>\n<aside>\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<amp-analytics class=""i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined"" style=""width:1px;height:1px;""

The museum is infamous for failing to seriously address how it acquired much of its own collection —\xa0 most notably the Parthenon sculptures (known as the “Elgin marbles”), but also <a href=""https://bookshop.org/books/the-brutish-museums-the-benin-bronzes-colonial-violence-and-cultural-restitution/9780745341767"">the Benin bronzes</a>, the <a href=""https://www.britishmuseum.org/about-us/british-museum-story/objects-news/maqdala-collection"">Maqdala collection</a>, and many other artifacts. “The world’s largest receiver of stolen goods” is what a leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, called the museum <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/british-museum-is-worlds-largest-receiver-of-stolen-goods-says-qc"">in the <em>Guardian</em> last November</a>. A day after the <em>Guardian</em> article, Robertson’s book <a href=""https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/who-owns-history""><em>Who Owns History? Elgin’s Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure</em></a> came out – and so did a British Museum blog post by St John Simpson on <a href=""https://blog.britishmuseum.org/art-in-crisis-identifying-and-returning-looted-objects/"">the British Museum’s work “identifying and returning looted objects.”</a> The timing is suggestive. Does the museum use its work policing the antiquities market to distract from its historic role in acquiring looted and smuggled objects?</p>\n\n<p>Museum public relations presents its work in identifying trafficked antiquities as an altruistic enterprise. “The British Museum is absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage,” director Hartwig Fischer assures the public in the museum’s press release for the Sumerian plaque. Earlier this year, Fischer praised the museum’s efforts “in the reconstruction of the rich cultural heritage of Afghanistan after decades of conflict, destruction and loss.” What goes unmentioned is that the British Museum receives many benefits from this and other cultural heritage efforts. For instance, it gets to put many of the trafficked artifacts it identifies on temporary display before handing them over to their source countries. (The Sumerian plaque is currently on temporary display at the British Museum.) And throughout, it gets glowing press coverage.</p>\n\n<p>The British Museum could use its work identifying smuggled antiquities to take a thoughtful look at its own past. Instead, we get empty clichés. The reality is that cultural heritage is determined by the powerful for their own benefit, whether they are governments, wealthy individuals — or institutions like the British Museum.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-11-05T18:26:41+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-10-27T18:11:00+00:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	random	Isn’t Doing Enough to Fight Illegal Antiquities Trafficking	Dan	Talks about museum not doing enough to fight illegal antique.

Carel	William Gale	Individual	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/06/gen-z-covid-19-financial-crisis-lasting-scars	"Graduation was supposed to be one of the best moments of Stephany Torres’s life.

As a first-generation student at the University of California Los Angeles, Torres was looking forward to celebrating her new degree with friends and family. After graduation, she was supposed to have an internship at a law firm in Los Angeles, making new connections and getting more insight into the type of law she wants to study.

Instead, graduation and the internship were cancelled. Torres, 21, who is from South Central Los Angeles, was laid off from her on-campus job that was helping her pay her rent and support her mother. She moved back home, and while she is planning on taking on a research position at UCLA, she has been trying to look for paid positions in the legal field.

“I had built up my resume to land an internship like this,” Torres said. “When that was taken from me it was really hard because I just feel so much uncertainty right now.”

The coronavirus pandemic has hit every generation hard, disproportionately killing older Americans and spreading economic fear across the entire country. For Gen Z, people born between 1997 and 2012, life has practically been upended and the ramifications of the virus and the financial crisis it has engendered threatens their livelihoods for years to come.

The unemployment rate for teens ages 16 to 19 peaked at 31% in April, more than double the national rate of 14.7%. College graduates who only months ago were on track to enter one of the best job markets in US history have instead landed in one of the worst. A slate of summer internships and jobs have been cancelled and they are worried about their parents struggling to pay bills.

A good chunk of Gen Z is still in school – the youngest are just eight years old. But for older “zoomers”, the effects of this economic downturn will likely be felt for years as they try to start careers and build savings with an economy that was struck to rubble.

“Early career events like this tend to have scarring effects, they tend to persist over time,” said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The jobs available or the wages available won’t be as good as they would have been otherwise.”

Grace Miller, 20, who will be a junior at Penn State University in the fall, emailed a local newspaper about potential internships before shutdowns began. She was told that she could potentially take on a paid position instead of an internship, but the publication stopped responding to her inquiries once shutdowns began.

Instead Miller is working at a restaurant this summer, trying to build up savings for rent and textbooks for the next school year. Her dream is to eventually work in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but she is unsure whether that dream will be a reality in a post-pandemic world.

“With journalism, there are so many newsrooms that are already struggling for money that are already cutting jobs. [Getting a job] was already going to be difficult in the first place, but add in this whole new situation and it’s concerning,” Miller said. “I’d like to think that by the time I graduate, maybe this will all be over, but I really highly doubt that.”

The US has already seen how a recession can undermine a whole generation’s ability to navigate their careers and build wealth: millennials, the group of people born between 1980 and 1996, have pretty much been defined by the effects of the last recession.

Research shows that the oldest millennials never fully recovered after the last recession hit the job and housing market. Millennials lost an estimated 13% of earnings from job cuts and reduced wages during the recession that they never got back.

A reduction in earning creates a cascading effect, especially since millennials are likely to have thousands of dollars of student and medical debt. And while those without a college degree may not have student debt, they are making far less than those with a college degree – a gap that has widened over the last few decades.

Debt makes it harder for a person to save and accumulate wealth in the form of assets. Young Americans have delayed buying homes, the most common way the average American builds wealth, due to debt and rising housing costs. Millennials have also delayed major life events, like starting families.

“Wealth inequality has worsened over the past 50 years, and you start to look at what groups are affected, and its young Americans,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, a vice president at the Urban Institute. “They’re barely breaking even with their parents. It used to be in America that every generation did better than the previous generation, but that’s no longer necessarily the case.”

The burden of debt and lack of wealth in the millennial cohort has had major health consequences. A report from the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that from 2008 and 2016, the mortality rates of people between the ages of 25 and 34 increased 20%, largely because of suicides and drug overdoses. These kinds of deaths, often called “ deaths of despair ” are closely tied to the economic troubles a person experiences that leads to hopelessness.

Gen Z is, of course, different from millennials, as members of the former love to point out. But David Grusky, a professor who put together the Stanford report, said millennials are the “canaries in the coal mine who reveal just how toxic these problems are”.

There is some hope that Gen Z is learning something from its elders. A study from earlier this year showed that Gen Z was increasingly careful with money and less likely to take out student loans than millennials.

Cyril King, 18, of West Haven, Connecticut, unenrolled from his dream school because the university was asking him to pay too much tuition – $35,000 – out of pocket. Losing a job he had in the spring hurt his finances, so King decided to enroll at Colgate University, which provided more financial aid and guaranteed that he would graduate debt free.

“I have dreams and aspirations. I want to help people. I want to be a lawyer, hopefully representing people who are unrepresented. Going to law school is another thing as well, so getting to leave without being in debt is perfect to me,” King said.

Many in Gen Z are also watching their parents struggle with unemployment or reduced hours at work amid shutdown orders and are aware their families cannot handle a big expense like college.

Taylor Pittman, 17, of New Orleans, Louisiana, said getting a full-ride scholarship to a college is the goal motivating her into her senior year of high school. Pittman has four internships this summer, all while helping care for her younger brother as her parents continue to work.

“I really just want [college] to be free so my mom and dad don’t have to stress out about paying for anything related to school,” Pittman said. “My mom and dad’s pockets can only stretch so far.”

When it came to deciding what college to go to, Jonathan Donis, 17, of Los Angeles made a list of schools that provided him with enough financial aid to graduate debt-free. The pandemic hit his family hard. His parents, essential workers who cannot work from home, have been working reduced hours and are seeing lower wages.

By going to college, Donis, who is going to Stanford University in the fall, hopes he can use his education to eventually help support his parents and his younger siblings.

“My parents always joke around like ‘you’re going to buy me a house when you graduate, right?’. I’m like, yeah, I want to own a house. I want to have a nice car. All those things that you see other people have that you don’t. I think that’s one of the things I want to do, help my parents and also help my siblings,” Donis said."

Photograph: Stanley Wu\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has hit every generation hard, disproportionately killing older Americans and spreading economic fear across the entire country. For Gen Z, people born between 1997 and 2012, life has practically been upended and the ramifications of the virus and the financial crisis it has engendered threatens their livelihoods for years to come.</p>\n<p>The <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">unemployment rate</a> for teens ages 16 to 19 peaked at 31% in April, more than double the national rate of 14.7%. College graduates who only months ago were on track to enter one of the best job markets in US history have instead landed in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/adapt-and-overcome-class-of-2020-inherits-worst-labor-market-since-the-great-depression"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">one of the worst</a>. A slate of summer internships and jobs have been cancelled and they are <a href=""https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/gen-zers-are-financially-struggling-during-covid-19-pandemic"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">worried</a> about their parents struggling to pay bills.</p>\n<p>A good chunk of Gen Z is still in school – the youngest are just eight years old. But for older “zoomers”, the effects of this economic downturn will likely be felt for years as they try to start careers and build savings with an economy that was struck to rubble.</p>\n<p>“Early career events like this tend to have scarring effects, they tend to persist over time,” said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The jobs available or the wages available won’t be as good as they would have been otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Grace Miller, 20, who will be a junior at Penn State University in the fall, emailed a local newspaper about potential internships before shutdowns began. She was told that she could potentially take on a paid position instead of an internship, but the publication stopped responding to her inquiries once shutdowns began.</p>\n<p>Instead Miller is working at a restaurant this summer, trying to build up savings for rent and textbooks for the next school year. Her dream is to eventually work in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but she is unsure whether that dream will be a reality in a post-pandemic world.</p>\n<p>“With journalism, there are so many newsrooms that are already struggling for money that are already cutting jobs. [Getting a job] was already going to be difficult in the first place, but add in this whole new situation and it’s concerning,” Miller said. “I’d like to think that by the time I graduate, maybe this will all be over, but I really highly doubt that.”</p>\n<figure itemprop=""associatedMedia image"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/ImageObject"" data-component=""image"" class=""element

Photograph: Courtesy of the subject\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The US has already seen how a recession can undermine a whole generation’s ability to navigate their careers and build wealth: millennials, the group of people born between 1980 and 1996, have pretty much been defined by the effects of the last recession.</p>\n<p>Research shows that the oldest millennials never fully recovered after the last recession hit the job and housing market. Millennials <a href=""https://kevinrinz.github.io/recession.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">lost</a> an estimated 13% of earnings from job cuts and reduced wages during the recession that they never got back.</p>\n<p>A reduction in earning creates a cascading effect, especially since <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/poll-majority-millennials-are-debt-hitting-pause-major-life-events-n862376"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">millennials</a> are likely to have thousands of dollars of <a href=""https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">student</a> and <a href=""https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/why-do-larger-share-millennials-and-gen-x-have-past-due-medical-debt-older-americans"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">medical</a> debt. And while those without a college degree may not have student debt, they are <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/06/despite-rising-costs-college-is-still-a-good-investment.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">making far less</a> than those with a college degree – a gap that has <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/12/pay-gap-between-college-grads-and-everyone-else-record/96493348/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">widened</a> over the last few decades.</p>\n<p>Debt makes it harder for a person to save and accumulate wealth in the form of assets. Young Americans have delayed <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/20/millennials-share-us-housing-market-small-shrinking/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">buying homes</a>, the most common way the average American builds wealth, due to debt and rising housing costs. Millennials have also delayed major life events, like <a href=""https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/05/27/as-millennials-near-40-theyre-approaching-family-life-differently-than-previous-generations/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">starting families</a>.</p>\n<p>“Wealth inequality has worsened over the past 50 years, and you start to look at what groups are affected, and its young Americans,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, a vice president at the Urban Institute. “They’re barely breaking even with their parents. It used to be in America that every generation did better than the previous generation, but that’s no longer necessarily the case.”</p>\n<p>The burden of debt and lack of wealth in the millennial cohort has had major health consequences. A <a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/2019/06/06/toxic-economic-trends-impacted-millennials/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">report</a> from the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that from 2008 and 2016, the mortality rates of people between the ages of 25 and 34 increased 20%, largely because of suicides and drug overdoses. These kinds of deaths, often called “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/deaths-of-despair-us-jobs-drugs-alcohol-suicide"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">deaths of despair</a>” are closely tied to the economic troubles a person experiences that leads to hopelessness.</p>\n<p>Gen Z is, of course, different from millennials, as members of the former love to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/gen-z-hate-millennials-handy-guide-generation-wars"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">point out</a>. But David Grusky, a professor who put together the Stanford report, <a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/2019/06/06/toxic-economic-trends-impacted-millennials/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">said</a> millennials are the “canaries in the coal mine who reveal just how toxic these problems are”.</p>\n<p>There is some hope that Gen Z is learning something from its elders. A <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/members-of-generation-z-are-financially-better-armed-and-better-educated-than-millennials-were-at-their-age-2020-01-29"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">study</a> from earlier this year showed that Gen Z was increasingly careful with money and less likely to take out student loans than millennials.</p>\n<p>Cyril King, 18, of West Haven, Connecticut, unenrolled from his dream school because the university was asking him to pay too much tuition – $35,000 – out of pocket. Losing a job he had in the spring hurt his finances, so King decided to enroll at Colgate University, which provided more financial aid and guaranteed that he would graduate debt free.</p>\n<figure

first-generation student at the University of California Los Angeles, Torres was looking forward to celebrating her new degree with friends and family. After graduation, she was supposed to have an internship at a law firm in Los Angeles, making new connections and getting more insight into the type of law she wants to study.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, graduation and the internship were cancelled. Torres, 21, who is from South Central Los Angeles, was laid off from her on-campus job that was helping her pay her rent and support her mother. She moved back home, and while she is planning on taking on a research position at UCLA, she has been trying to look for paid positions in the legal field.</p>\n\n<p>“I had built up my resume to land an internship like this,” Torres said. “When that was taken from me it was really hard because I just feel so much uncertainty right now.”</p>\n\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has hit every generation hard, disproportionately killing older Americans and spreading economic fear across the entire country. For Gen Z, people born between 1997 and 2012, life has practically been upended and the ramifications of the virus and the financial crisis it has engendered threatens their livelihoods for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm"" data-link-name=""in body link"">unemployment rate</a> for teens ages 16 to 19 peaked at 31% in April, more than double the national rate of 14.7%. College graduates who only months ago were on track to enter one of the best job markets in US history have instead landed in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/adapt-and-overcome-class-of-2020-inherits-worst-labor-market-since-the-great-depression"" data-link-name=""in body link"">one of the worst</a>. A slate of summer internships and jobs have been cancelled and they are <a href=""https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/gen-zers-are-financially-struggling-during-covid-19-pandemic"" data-link-name=""in body link"">worried</a> about their parents struggling to pay bills.</p>\n\n<p>A good chunk of Gen Z is still in school – the youngest are just eight years old. But for older “zoomers”, the effects of this economic downturn will likely be felt for years as they try to start careers and build savings with an economy that was struck to rubble.</p>\n\n<p>“Early career events like this tend to have scarring effects, they tend to persist over time,” said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The jobs available or the wages available won’t be as good as they would have been otherwise.”</p>\n\n<p>Grace Miller, 20, who will be a junior at Penn State University in the fall, emailed a local newspaper about potential internships before shutdowns began. She was told that she could potentially take on a paid position instead of an internship, but the publication stopped responding to her inquiries once shutdowns began.</p>\n\n<p>Instead Miller is working at a restaurant this summer, trying to build up savings for rent and textbooks for the next school year.

Carel	HSBC	Organization	https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/03/business/hsbc-results-2020-intl-hnk/index.html	"Hong Kong (CNN Business) HSBC (HSBC) said on Monday that escalating tensions between China and the West are creating ""challenging situations"" for its business after the global bank reported a 65% plunge in profits in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The London-based lender, which makes most of its money in Asia, said Monday that pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell 65% to $4.3 billion compared to the same time last year, as revenue fell, the coronavirus crisis hit and credit losses were worse than expected.

CEO Noel Quinn said US-China tensions had so far not had a material impact on earnings but he acknowledged that ""current tensions between China and the US inevitably create challenging situations for an organization with HSBC's footprint.""

""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors,"" he added.

The bank warned that expected credit losses for 2020 could hit as much as $13 billion this year, worse than earlier estimates ""given the deterioration in consensus economic forecasts.""

The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown due to an ""impairment of software intangibles, mainly in Europe.""

Falling income didn't help either. The bank's revenue tumbled 9% in the first half versus the same time last year, hurting profits even more.

HSBC shares in Hong Kong closed down 4.4% following the earnings report to 33 Hong Kong dollars (about $4.3), its lowest price since March 2009, according to data provider Refinitiv. Its London-listed shares fell 5.6%.

The bank's stock in London and Hong Kong are both down more than 40% so far this year.

Prior to the pandemic, HSBC had already been going through severe financial challenges. It announced in February that it would cut around 35,000 jobs and dramatically overhaul its business after profit had plunged by a third in 2019.

Then the coronavirus crisis got worse. The bank suspended most of its restructuring plans earlier this year, saying it hoped to reduce uncertainty for employees amid the pandemic.

Now, Quinn said, the bank will have to ""accelerate"" those plans, as well as review ""what additional actions we need to take in light of the new economic environment to make HSBC a stronger and more sustainable business.""

Worsening relations between China and the West have also put HSBC in a tight spot.

Chinese state media, for instance, has accused HSBC of colluding with the United States in its legal fight against Huawei, the Chinese tech giant. The bank last week denied those allegations.

Asked about US-China tensions on an analyst call Monday, Quinn stressed that the bank had not seen ""any material impact"" from the issue on its business in the first half of the year.

Chinese state media has previously suggested that the bank could appear on a long-rumored list of ""unreliable"" foreign companies that China could blacklist. The bank has also been floated as a potential target for retaliation by Beijing in its battle with the West over trade, technology and national security.

""It's not right or proper for me to speculate on what may or may not happen with regard to sanctions,"" Quinn said. ""But I come back to, we've seen a very strong performance in the first half of this year from our business in Asia.""

The company pulled in $7.4 billion in pre-tax profits in Asia over the first half, ""demonstrating the strength and continued resilience of our operations in the region,"" HSBC said.

Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson added that the bank would look out for a number of factors in the second half, including US-China tensions and ""any impact this has on our Hong Kong franchise."""

Carel	Mossimo Gianulli	Individual	http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/mossimo-inc-history/	"A dynamic force in the apparel industry during the 1990s, Mossimo, Inc. sells men's and women's sportswear and activewear, retailing its apparel through 100 in-store shops located in department stores and specialty retailers. The Mossimo label, created by Mossimo Giannulli, gained notoriety during the late 1980s, becoming a highly popular brand of beachwear. During the 1990s the company expanded into sportswear and registered great success. Further expansion during the mid-1990s into upscale menswear yielded disappointing results, leading to numbing financial losses. The losses led to a 25 percent reduction in employment and pervasive cost-cutting measures. Giannulli, who presided as chairman and maintained creative control over Mossimo, Inc., owned 73.3 percent of the company, which also included two stand-alone retail stores. The company's headquarters and production facilities were located in Irvine, California.

Early Success Spawns Expansion

Mossimo Giannulli was born Massimo Giannulli--a slight variation on the name he used to create a half-billion-dollar apparel company. As a child, Giannulli was given the nickname ""Moss,"" which had evolved into Mossimo by the time he enrolled at the University of Southern California and, shortly thereafter, decided to try his luck as an entrepreneur. Giannulli dropped out of the University of Southern California in 1987, borrowed $100,000 from his father (a landscape architect in Los Angeles), and retreated to his apartment on Balboa Island. There, he developed an entrepreneurial strategy based wholly on marketing, not on product innovation or on product quality. With the money he received from his father, Giannulli began making three-paneled, neon-colored beach volleyball shorts and T-shirts. On each garment, he emblazoned his signature and what would become his trademark ""M."" He then peddled his beachwear--referred to as ""activewear"" in the apparel industry&mdashÃ¸ local surf shops, loading the garments in the trunk of his car. Almost overnight, Mossimo shorts and shirts became the newest trend on Southern California beaches. The reason for their popularity, as near as anyone could determine, was the Mossimo name, which had transcended from absolute obscurity to a symbol of chic cachet in a matter of months. Though his quick success might have surprised Giannulli, the emergence of his Mossimo garments as a new fashion trend did not. From the start in his Balboa Island apartment, Giannulli was convinced of the wonders marketing could produce in the apparel industry. ""From day one,"" Giannulli explained, ""I have positioned this thing as a lifestyle company.""

Drawing its marketing strength from the power of the Mossimo name, Giannulli's company recorded blistering sales growth during its first year of existence. By the end of his first year Giannulli had grossed $1 million and generated enough of a profit to pay back his father. By the end of 1989 sales had swelled fourfold to $4 million, infusing Giannulli with confidence and prompting him to test how far the popularity of the Mossimo name could carry him. He decided to expand his product line and thereby market the Mossimo name to a broader customer base, realizing that exponentially higher sales and his legitimacy as a clothing designer could only be achieved by diversifying beyond beachwear. Giannulli hired an experienced designer in 1991 and began manufacturing casual sportswear and accessories, adorning each item with the highly popular Mossimo name. The debut of Mossimo woven sweaters, knit shirts, and fleece sweatshirts marked a pivotal turning point in the company's development, moving Mossimo, Inc. from the activewear niche of the apparel industry to the decidedly larger sportswear segment. Concurrent with this shift in emphasis toward sportswear, Giannulli gradually began to move away from distributing his apparel to small surf and beachwear shops and focused instead on department stores and large specialty chains, his preferred retail locales. His diversification was a gamble, but the risk paid off. Consumers, mostly teenage customers, clamored for the new Mossimo line of sportswear and accessories, eager to purchase anything with the Mossimo label. In response, Giannulli increased prices and leveraged his success to obtain better deals from his suppliers. The result was an astounding level of profitability that by far eclipsed the net profit margins averaged by his rivals and made Mossimo, Inc. one of the most closely watched competitors in the apparel industry. ""I was given a pretty wonderful name,"" Giannulli remarked during an interview with Daily News Record, attempting to explain his success. ""If I was Tom, I don't know if we'd be sitting here having this conversation--that was my brother's name and he's not here.""

Annual sales by 1993 pushed past $20 million, providing Giannulli with the resources to hatch increasingly more ambitious plans. By this point the company had established its headquarters in Irvine, California, where a 4,600-square-foot factory produced Mossimo activewear, sportswear, and a growing collection of Mossimo accessories, such as eyewear, wallets, belts, bags, shoes, and hats. All of these items, plus the company's men's and women's sportswear, were showcased in Giannulli's newest creation--his own 2,600-square-foot retail store. Called Mossimo Supply, the store opened in December 1993 in a mall near Costa Mesa, which reportedly attracted 18 million visitors a year. There, amid other retail stores operated by Calvin Klein, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Tiffany & Co., and Gucci, Giannulli's store stood, sharing space with some of the apparel industry's elite designers. Mossimo Supply's proximity to such company was by design. ""It's a good chance,"" Giannulli said, ""that somebody will walk out of Armani Exchange or Ralph Lauren and into our store."" Giannulli then offered a telling statement that revealed his professional desires and the future direction Mossimo, Inc. would take. ""I want to compete with those people in a big way,"" he said. In the coming years Mossimo, Inc. would be shaped by Giannulli's goal to become one of the industry's elite fashion designers.

Mid-1990s Growth and Public Offering

Any uncertainty regarding Giannulli's professional aspirations was eliminated after a 1994 interview with Action Sports Retailer. Giannulli said: ""When I look at Calvin [Klein] or Armani or Ralph Lauren, those are the companies I want to be associated with, and I'm not settling for anything less. I will do everything in my power to get there."" To ascend the fashion world's hierarchy, Giannulli sought to legitimize himself as a designer through Mossimo, Inc., which appeared more than capable of supporting its founder's climb. On the retail front, another store was opened in New York City as part of Giannulli's plan to establish a retail presence in a handful of major metropolitan areas, including Dallas, San Francisco, and Chicago, but by 1995 neither of the company's stores had shown a profit, curbing plans for further expansion. Success in the retail field had been achieved, however, through another venture. Giannulli began opening shops within department stores, establishing his in-store shops in stores such as Macy's, the Bon MarchÃ©, and Dayton Hudson. By the beginning of 1995 there were more than 30 Mossimo in-store shops, selling an apparel line that reflected the ""new"" Mossimo, Inc. taking shape. By the mid-1990s, activewear--the T-shirts, shorts, and sweatshirts that once represented the entirety of Giannulli's business&mdashcounted for 60 percent of sales, its contribution to the company's revenue volume decreasing with each passing year. The balance was derived from the sale of accessories and the company's sportswear line of knit and woven shirts and denim, which accounted for 34 percent of sales in 1995, up from 20 percent two years earlier. During this transition Mossimo, Inc.'s sales shot upward, increasing at an annual compound rate of 46.6 percent during the first half of the 1990s to reach $110 million by 1995. Profits kept pace as well, primarily because consumers had demonstrated a willingness to pay increasingly higher prices for garments with the Mossimo name. In 1995 the company's net profit margin rested at 16 percent, far above the six percent averaged by rival Quicksilver and higher than the 13 percent recorded by Tommy Hilfiger, the fashion industry's phenom. It was against this backdrop of resounding success that Giannulli began, in earnest, to pursue his goal of becoming an upscale fashion designer.

In the first nine months of 1995, Mossimo, Inc. opened 11 in-store shops in nine department stores and specialty chains, giving the company a total of 46 in-store retail locations. Giannulli wanted to establish more stores and he wanted to introduce a more sophisticated apparel line that would improve his standing in the fashion world. Both pursuits required money, so in December 1995 Giannulli announced his plans to sell shares in Mossimo, Inc. to the public, intending to use the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) to finance the establishment of new in-store shops, reduce debt, and pay for a new headquarters and distribution facility. The IPO was completed in February 1996, making 32-year-old Giannulli the youngest chief executive officer of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. More important, the IPO raised $36 million, more than twice the total expected when the public offering was announced two months earlier. Mossimo, Inc.'s stock debuted at $18 a share and skyrocketed to $50 a share by June 1996, enriching investors exponentially in a four-month span. Giannulli and everyone associated with the company were ecstatic. One Wall Street analyst described Giannulli as the ""next Calvin Klein,"" precisely the recognition Giannulli had been seeking. To spark further enthusiasm, the company's prospects pointed to an even greater growth. The entire Mossimo collection was being distributed in Japan, Canada, and Australia, with an aggressive European expansion plan slated to begin in 1998. Before the push into Europe, Giannulli planned for a high-profile fashion show in New York City in 1997 and hired approximately a dozen designers and executives from competitors such as Calvin Klein and Guess. It was difficult to imagine Mossimo, Inc. occupying a more enviable position than it did as the fall 1996 fashion season approached, but by the time the fall season did arrive, Giannulli found himself in desperate straits. Mossimo, Inc.'s stock value began to plummet, stripping Giannulli of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Late 1990s Fall from Grace

When Mossimo, Inc. reported at the end of September 1996 that its profits were down nearly 50 percent for the third quarter, the company's stock plunged to $15 a share within a month. Giannulli, who owned 73.3 of Mossimo, Inc.'s stock, saw his net worth reduced by $380 million. To blame were high production and development costs, which reduced earnings and caused the value of the company's stock to cascade downward. Giannulli conceded that ""we overdeveloped,"" but remained optimistic despite his huge financial loss, saying, ""ultimately we will hit the numbers."" Traded as a publicly owned company, Mossimo, Inc. needed to demonstrate consistent, quarterly profits to maintain its value, but after years of profitability as a privately held firm, the company failed to generate profits when profits were needed most. Critics cited the company's rapid expansion as the cause, explaining that operationally Mossimo, Inc. was ill-equipped to embark on the ambitious plans developed by Giannulli. Amid this criticism, Mossimo, Inc.'s profits slid quarter by quarter, prompting one shareholder to file a lawsuit against the company, charging that Giannulli had ""completely lost control of the company's operations."" By February 1997--one year after the company's IPO--Mossimo, Inc.'s stock had dipped below $9 a share, causing further anxiety. The company lost $498,000 during the first quarter of 1997, compared with a $5.8 million profit for the same period one year earlier. To combat chronically deteriorating profitability, Giannulli reverted to a page from his own history, rekindling memories of his days as an upstart operating out of a Balboa Island apartment.

In May 1997, after closing his watch division, Giannulli announced plans for a new line of Mossimo activewear, the cotton T-shirts and swimwear that had given him his start. It was hoped that the introduction of this new, lower-priced line of activewear, combined with continuing efforts to reduce costs wherever possible, would arrest the company's perilous financial slide, but the losses continued to mount. By the fall of 1997, after posting a $4.8 million loss and a 46 percent decrease in sales for the company's third quarter, Giannulli had decided to seek help. ""I am looking for a really good operational head who will be in partnership with me,"" he announced. ""I want someone who will help us grow a long time, and stay for a while, not someone who will just come in and out of this joint."" Giannulli dropped the titles of president and chief executive officer in favor of the more ephemeral title of ""visionary,"" yet remained chairman as the search for a savior went forward. In January 1998 John P. Brincko, a turnaround specialist credited with reviving Barney's Inc. and Knudsen Foods, was hired as a consultant, arriving at a desperate juncture in Mossimo, Inc.'s history. For the fourth quarter of 1997 the company expected to lose roughly $14 million, nearly identical to the sum it hoped to generate in sales. In March 1998 Brincko took over as president and chief executive officer, inheriting a company that lost $18.7 million in 1997 on $70.9 million in revenues, which represented a 34 percent decline from 1996's sales volume.

By the time Brincko assumed operational control over the company, Giannulli's wealth had shriveled from $550 million in the summer of 1996 to $60 million. As Brincko scrutinized every aspect of Mossimo, Inc.'s business, including distribution, marketing, production, sales, inventory, and financial management, Giannulli's Laguna Beach estate was up for sale, making his fall from the top more precipitous than the startling pace of his ascension. Looking ahead, Brincko was hoping for the turnaround he had been hired to execute, but the company's profitability problems continued to hobble progress as the end of 1998 approached. Mossimo, Inc. reported a $6.1 million loss for 1998's second quarter, and by the fall its stock had fallen to less than $3 a share, reducing the value of Giannulli's stake to $30 million. Brincko was optimistic, however, saying that the company's 1999 line of denim and knit tops would show that Mossimo, Inc. was ""headed in the right direction."" The validity of such hope was to be determined in the years ahead, as Brincko sought to rebuild what had been created by Giannulli and ensure that Mossimo, Inc. could look forward to a future.

The losses led to a 25 percent reduction in employment and pervasive cost-cutting measures. Giannulli, who presided as chairman and maintained creative control over Mossimo, Inc., owned 73.3 percent of the company, which also included two stand-alone retail stores. The company\'s headquarters and production facilities were located in Irvine, California.\n\nEarly Success Spawns Expansion\n\nMossimo Giannulli was born Massimo Giannulli--a slight variation on the name he used to create a half-billion-dollar apparel company. As a child, Giannulli was given the nickname ""Moss,"" which had evolved into Mossimo by the time he enrolled at the University of Southern California and, shortly thereafter, decided to try his luck as an entrepreneur. Giannulli dropped out of the University of Southern California in 1987, borrowed $100,000 from his father (a landscape architect in Los Angeles), and retreated to his apartment on Balboa Island. There, he developed an entrepreneurial strategy based wholly on marketing, not on product innovation or on product quality. With the money he received from his father, Giannulli began making three-paneled, neon-colored beach volleyball shorts and T-shirts. On each garment, he emblazoned his signature and what would become his trademark ""M."" He then peddled his beachwear--referred to as ""activewear"" in the apparel industry&mdashÃ¸ local surf shops, loading the garments in the trunk of his car. Almost overnight, Mossimo shorts and shirts became the newest trend on Southern California beaches. The reason for their popularity, as near as anyone could determine, was the Mossimo name, which had transcended from absolute obscurity to a symbol of chic cachet in a matter of months. Though his quick success might have surprised Giannulli, the emergence of his Mossimo garments as a new fashion trend did not. From the start in his Balboa Island apartment, Giannulli was convinced of the wonders marketing could produce in the apparel industry. ""From day one,"" Giannulli explained, ""I have positioned this thing as a lifestyle company.""\n\nDrawing its marketing strength from the power of the Mossimo name, Giannulli\'s company recorded blistering sales growth during its first year of existence. By the end of his first year Giannulli had grossed $1 million and generated enough of a profit to pay back his father. By the end of 1989 sales had swelled fourfold to $4 million, infusing Giannulli with confidence and prompting him to test how far the popularity of the Mossimo name could carry him. He decided to expand his product line and thereby market the Mossimo name to a broader customer base, realizing that exponentially higher sales and his legitimacy as a clothing designer could only be achieved by diversifying beyond beachwear. Giannulli hired an experienced designer in 1991 and began manufacturing casual sportswear and accessories, adorning each item with the highly popular Mossimo name. The debut of Mossimo woven sweaters, knit shirts, and fleece sweatshirts marked a pivotal turning point in the company\'s development, moving Mossimo, Inc. from the activewear niche of the apparel industry to the decidedly larger sportswear segment. Concurrent with this shift in emphasis toward sportswear, Giannulli gradually began to move away from distributing his apparel to small surf and beachwear shops and focused instead on department stores and large specialty chains, his preferred retail locales. His diversification was a gamble, but the risk paid off. Consumers, mostly teenage customers, clamored for the new Mossimo line of sportswear and accessories, eager to purchase anything with the Mossimo label. In response, Giannulli increased prices and leveraged his success to obtain better deals from his suppliers. The result was an astounding level of profitability that by far eclipsed the net profit margins averaged by his rivals and made Mossimo, Inc. one of the most closely watched competitors in the apparel industry. ""I was given a pretty wonderful name,"" Giannulli remarked during an interview with Daily News Record, attempting to explain his success. ""If I was Tom, I don\'t know if we\'d be sitting here having this conversation--that was my brother\'s name and he\'s not here.""\n\nAnnual sales by 1993 pushed past $20 million, providing Giannulli with the resources to hatch increasingly more ambitious plans. By this point the company had established its headquarters in Irvine, California, where a 4,600-square-foot factory produced Mossimo activewear, sportswear, and a growing collection of Mossimo accessories, such as eyewear, wallets, belts, bags, shoes, and hats. All of these items, plus the company\'s men\'s and women\'s sportswear, were showcased in Giannulli\'s newest creation--his own 2,600-square-foot retail store. Called Mossimo Supply, the store opened in December 1993 in a mall near Costa Mesa, which reportedly attracted 18 million visitors a year. There, amid other retail stores operated by Calvin Klein, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Tiffany & Co., and Gucci, Giannulli\'s store stood, sharing space with some of the apparel industry\'s elite designers. Mossimo Supply\'s proximity to such company was by design. ""It\'s a good chance,"" Giannulli said, ""that somebody will walk out of Armani Exchange or Ralph Lauren and into our store."" Giannulli then offered a telling statement that revealed his professional desires and the future direction Mossimo, Inc. would take. ""I want to compete with those people in a big way,"" he said. In the coming years Mossimo, Inc. would be shaped by Giannulli\'s goal to become one of the industry\'s elite fashion designers.\n\nMid-1990s Growth and Public Offering\n\nAny uncertainty regarding Giannulli\'s professional aspirations was eliminated after a 1994 interview with Action Sports Retailer. Giannulli said: ""When I look at Calvin [Klein] or Armani or Ralph Lauren, those are the companies I want to be associated with, and I\'m not settling for anything less. I will do everything in my power to get there."" To ascend the fashion world\'s hierarchy, Giannulli sought to legitimize himself as a designer through Mossimo, Inc., which appeared more than capable of supporting its founder\'s climb. On the retail front, another store was opened in New York City as part of Giannulli\'s plan to establish a retail presence in a handful of major metropolitan areas, including Dallas, San Francisco, and Chicago, but by 1995 neither of the company\'s stores had shown a profit, curbing plans for further expansion. Success in the retail field had been achieved, however, through another venture. Giannulli began opening shops within department stores, establishing his in-store shops in stores such as Macy\'s, the Bon MarchÃ©, and Dayton Hudson. By the beginning of 1995 there were more than 30 Mossimo in-store shops, selling an apparel line that reflected the ""new"" Mossimo, Inc. taking shape. By the mid-1990s, activewear--the T-shirts, shorts, and sweatshirts that once represented the entirety of Giannulli\'s business&mdashcounted for 60 percent of sales, its contribution to the company\'s revenue volume decreasing with each passing year. The balance was derived from the sale of accessories and the company\'s sportswear line of knit and woven shirts and denim, which accounted for 34 percent of sales in 1995, up from 20 percent two years earlier. During this transition Mossimo, Inc.\'s sales shot upward, increasing at an annual compound rate of 46.6 percent during the first half of the 1990s to reach $110 million by 1995. Profits kept pace as well, primarily because consumers had demonstrated a willingness to pay increasingly higher prices for garments with the Mossimo name. In 1995 the company\'s net profit margin rested at 16 percent, far above the six percent averaged by rival Quicksilver and higher than the 13 percent recorded by Tommy Hilfiger, the fashion industry\'s phenom. It was against this backdrop of resounding success that Giannulli began, in earnest, to pursue his goal of becoming an upscale fashion designer.\n\nIn the first nine months of 1995, Mossimo, Inc. opened 11 in-store shops in nine department stores and specialty chains, giving the company a total of 46 in-store retail locations. Giannulli wanted to establish more stores and he wanted to introduce a more sophisticated apparel line that would improve his standing in the fashion world. Both pursuits required money, so in December 1995 Giannulli announced his plans to sell shares in Mossimo, Inc. to the public, intending to use the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) to finance the establishment of new in-store shops, reduce debt, and pay for a new headquarters and distribution facility. The IPO was completed in February 1996, making 32-year-old Giannulli the youngest chief executive officer of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. More important, the IPO raised $36 million, more than twice the total expected when the public offering was announced two months earlier. Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock debuted at $18 a share and skyrocketed to $50 a share by June 1996, enriching investors exponentially in a four-month span. Giannulli and everyone associated with the company were ecstatic. One Wall Street analyst described Giannulli as the ""next Calvin Klein,"" precisely the recognition Giannulli had been seeking. To spark further enthusiasm, the company\'s prospects pointed to an even greater growth. The entire Mossimo collection was being distributed in Japan, Canada, and Australia, with an aggressive European expansion plan slated to begin in 1998. Before the push into Europe, Giannulli planned for a high-profile fashion show in New York City in 1997 and hired approximately a dozen designers and executives from competitors such as Calvin Klein and Guess. It was difficult to imagine Mossimo, Inc. occupying a more enviable position than it did as the fall 1996 fashion season approached, but by the time the fall season did arrive, Giannulli found himself in desperate straits. Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock value began to plummet, stripping Giannulli of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nLate 1990s Fall from Grace\n\nWhen Mossimo, Inc. reported at the end of September 1996 that its profits were down nearly 50 percent for the third quarter, the company\'s stock plunged to $15 a share within a month. Giannulli, who owned 73.3 of Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock, saw his net worth reduced by $380 million. To blame were high production and development costs, which reduced earnings and caused the value of the company\'s stock to cascade downward. Giannulli conceded that ""we overdeveloped,"" but remained optimistic despite his huge financial loss, saying, ""ultimately we will hit the numbers."" Traded as a publicly owned company, Mossimo, Inc. needed to demonstrate consistent, quarterly profits to maintain its value, but after years of profitability as a privately held firm, the company failed to generate profits when profits were needed most. Critics cited the company\'s rapid expansion as the cause, explaining that operationally Mossimo, Inc. was ill-equipped to embark on the ambitious plans developed by Giannulli. Amid this criticism, Mossimo, Inc.\'s profits slid quarter by quarter, prompting one shareholder to file a lawsuit against the company, charging that Giannulli had ""completely lost control of the company\'s operations."" By February 1997--one year after the company\'s IPO--Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock had dipped below $9 a share, causing further anxiety. The company lost $498,000 during the first quarter of 1997, compared with a $5.8 million profit for the same period one year earlier. To combat chronically deteriorating profitability, Giannulli reverted to a page from his own history, rekindling memories of his days as an upstart operating out of a Balboa Island apartment.\n\nIn May 1997, after closing his watch division, Giannulli announced plans for a new line of Mossimo activewear, the cotton T-shirts and swimwear that had given him his start. It was hoped that the introduction of this new, lower-priced line of activewear, combined with continuing efforts to reduce costs wherever possible, would arrest the company\'s perilous financial slide, but the losses continued to mount. By the fall of 1997, after posting a $4.8 million loss and a 46 percent decrease in sales for the company\'s third quarter, Giannulli had decided to seek help. ""I am looking for a really good operational head who will be in partnership with me,"" he announced. ""I want someone who will help us grow a long time, and stay for a while, not someone who will just come in and out of this joint."" Giannulli dropped the titles of president and chief executive officer in favor of the more ephemeral title of ""visionary,"" yet remained chairman as the search for a savior went forward. In January 1998 John P. Brincko, a turnaround specialist credited with reviving Barney\'s Inc. and Knudsen Foods, was hired as a consultant, arriving at a desperate juncture in Mossimo, Inc.\'s history. For the fourth quarter of 1997 the company expected to lose roughly $14 million, nearly identical to the sum it hoped to generate in sales. In March 1998 Brincko took over as president and chief executive officer, inheriting a company that lost $18.7 million in 1997 on $70.9 million in revenues, which represented a 34 percent decline from 1996\'s sales volume.\n\nBy the time Brincko assumed operational control over the company, Giannulli\'s wealth had shriveled from $550 million in the summer of 1996 to $60 million. As Brincko scrutinized every aspect of Mossimo, Inc.\'s business, including distribution, marketing, production, sales, inventory, and financial management, Giannulli\'s Laguna Beach estate was up for sale, making his fall from the top more precipitous than the startling pace of his ascension. Looking ahead, Brincko was hoping for the turnaround he had been hired to execute, but the company\'s profitability problems continued to hobble progress as the end of 1998 approached. Mossimo, Inc. reported a $6.1 million loss for 1998\'s second quarter, and by the fall its stock had fallen to less than $3 a share, reducing the value of Giannulli\'s stake to $30 million. Brincko was optimistic, however, saying that the company\'s 1999 line of denim and knit tops would show that Mossimo, Inc. was ""headed in the right direction."" The validity of such hope was to be determined in the years ahead, as Brincko sought to rebuild what had been created by Giannulli and ensure that Mossimo, Inc. could look forward to a future.\n\nPrincipal Divisions: Mossimo Supply; Mossimo Swim.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nBarron, Kelly, ""Converting Clothing Line from Casual to High Fashion a Slow Process,"" Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News, April 21, 1997, p. 42.\nEllis, Kristi, ""Mossimo\'s Wild Ride: A Rocket to the Stars, a Plunge Back to Earth,"" WWD, November 13, 1996, p. 1.\nHardesty, Greg, ""Turnaround Specialist Takes Reins at Struggling Clothing Designer,"" Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News, March 6, 1998, p. 3.\nLa Franco, Robert, ""A Cool Dude with Vision,"" Forbes, May 20, 1996, p. 264.\n----, ""Minimo Mossimo,"" Forbes, April 20, 1998, p. 16.\nMarlow, Michael, ""Mossimo Giannulli Trying To Catch a New Wave,"" Daily News Record, October 22, 1997, p. 12.\n----, ""The Moss Market: After Years of Searching, California Finally May Have Found Its Designer,"" Daily News Record, July 22, 1996, p. 32.\n""Mossimo COO Resigns as Sales Plummet,"" Daily News Record, November 12, 1997, p. 4.\nMouchard, Andre, ""San Francisco-Based Company To Make T-Shirts for Clothing Designer Mossimo,"" Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News, October 5, 1998, p. 8.\nRyan, Thomas J., ""Mossimo\'s Hot-Air Balloon Popped,"" Footwear News, February 3, 1997, p. 96.\nYoung, Vicki M., ""Mossimo Loses $6.1 Million, But CEO Cites Cause To Hope,"" WWD, August 17, 1998, p. 24.', 'description': ""Read about the history of Mossimo, Inc.

The Mossimo label, created by Mossimo Giannulli, gained notoriety during the late 1980s, becoming a highly popular brand of beachwear. During the 1990s the company expanded into sportswear and registered great success. Further expansion during the mid-1990s into upscale menswear yielded disappointing results, leading to numbing financial losses.

Both pursuits required money, so in December 1995 Giannulli announced his plans to sell shares in Mossimo, Inc. to the public, intending to use the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) to finance the establishment of new in-store shops, reduce debt, and pay for a new headquarters and distribution facility. The IPO was completed in February 1996, making 32-year-old Giannulli the youngest chief executive officer of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. More important, the IPO raised $36 million, more than twice the total expected when the public offering was announced two months earlier. Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock debuted at $18 a share and skyrocketed to $50 a share by June 1996, enriching investors exponentially in a four-month span.

To spark further enthusiasm, the company\'s prospects pointed to an even greater growth. The entire Mossimo collection was being distributed in Japan, Canada, and Australia, with an aggressive European expansion plan slated to begin in 1998. Before the push into Europe, Giannulli planned for a high-profile fashion show in New York City in 1997 and hired approximately a dozen designers and executives from competitors such as Calvin Klein and <a href=""http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/guess-inc-history/"">Guess</a>.

In March 1998 Brincko took over as president and chief executive officer, inheriting a company that lost $18.7 million in 1997 on $70.9 million in revenues, which represented a 34 percent decline from 1996\'s sales volume. </p>\n<p>By the time Brincko assumed operational control over the company, Giannulli\'s wealth had shriveled from $550 million in the summer of 1996 to $60 million. As Brincko scrutinized every aspect of Mossimo, Inc.\'s business, including distribution, marketing, production, sales, inventory, and financial management, Giannulli\'s Laguna Beach estate was up for sale, making his fall from the top more precipitous than the startling pace of his ascension. Looking ahead, Brincko was hoping for the turnaround he had been hired to execute, but the company\'s profitability problems continued to hobble progress as the end of 1998 approached. Mossimo, Inc. reported a $6.1 million loss for 1998\'s second quarter, and by the fall its stock had fallen to less than $3 a share, reducing the value of Giannulli\'s stake to $30 million. Brincko was optimistic, however, saying that the company\'s 1999 line of denim and knit tops would show that Mossimo, Inc. was ""headed in the right direction."" The validity of such hope was to be determined in the years ahead, as Brincko sought to rebuild what had been created by Giannulli and ensure that Mossimo, Inc. could look forward to a future. </p>\n<p><strong>Principal Divisions:</strong> Mossimo Supply; Mossimo Swim. </p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Further Reading:</h4>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Barron, Kelly, ""Converting Clothing Line from Casual to High Fashion a Slow Process,""<em> Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News,</em> April 21, 1997, p. 42.</li>\n<li>Ellis, Kristi, ""Mossimo\'s Wild Ride: A Rocket to the Stars, a Plunge Back to Earth,""<em> WWD,</em> November 13, 1996, p. 1.</li>\n<li>Hardesty, Greg, ""Turnaround Specialist Takes Reins at Struggling Clothing Designer,""<em> Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News,</em> March 6, 1998, p. 3.</li>\n<li>La Franco, Robert, ""A Cool Dude with Vision,""<em> Forbes,</em> May 20, 1996, p. 264.</li>\n<li>----, ""Minimo Mossimo,""<em> Forbes,</em> April 20, 1998, p. 16.</li>\n<li>Marlow, Michael, ""Mossimo Giannulli Trying To Catch a New Wave,""<em> Daily News Record,</em> October 22, 1997, p. 12.</li>\n<li>----, ""The Moss Market: After Years of Searching, California Finally May Have Found Its Designer,""<em> Daily News Record,</em> July 22, 1996, p. 32.</li>\n<li>""Mossimo COO Resigns as Sales Plummet,""<em> Daily News Record,</em> November 12, 1997, p. 4.</li>\n<li>Mouchard, Andre, ""San Francisco-Based Company To Make T-Shirts for Clothing Designer Mossimo,""<em> Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News,</em> October 5, 1998, p. 8.</li>\n<li>Ryan, Thomas J., ""Mossimo\'s Hot-Air Balloon Popped,""<em> Footwear News,</em> February 3, 1997, p. 96.</li>\n<li>Young, Vicki M., ""Mossimo Loses $6.1 Million, But CEO Cites Cause To Hope,""<em> WWD,</em> August 17, 1998, p. 24.</li>\n</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Source: </strong><em>International Directory of Company Histories</em>, Vol. 27.

The Mossimo label, created by Mossimo Giannulli, gained notoriety during the late 1980s, becoming a highly popular brand of beachwear. During the 1990s the company expanded into sportswear and registered great success. Further expansion during the mid-1990s into upscale menswear yielded disappointing results, leading to numbing financial losses. The losses led to a 25 percent reduction in employment and pervasive cost-cutting measures. Giannulli, who presided as chairman and maintained creative control over Mossimo, Inc., owned 73.3 percent of the company, which also included two stand-alone retail stores. The company\'s headquarters and production facilities were located in Irvine, California.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early Success Spawns Expansion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mossimo Giannulli was born Massimo Giannulli--a slight variation on the name he used to create a half-billion-dollar apparel company. As a child, Giannulli was given the nickname ""Moss,"" which had evolved into Mossimo by the time he enrolled at the University of Southern California and, shortly thereafter, decided to try his luck as an entrepreneur. Giannulli dropped out of the University of Southern California in 1987, borrowed $100,000 from his father (a landscape architect in Los Angeles), and retreated to his apartment on Balboa Island. There, he developed an entrepreneurial strategy based wholly on marketing, not on product innovation or on product quality. With the money he received from his father, Giannulli began making three-paneled, neon-colored beach volleyball shorts and T-shirts. On each garment, he emblazoned his signature and what would become his trademark ""M."" He then peddled his beachwear--referred to as ""activewear"" in the apparel industry&amp;mdashÃ¸ local surf shops, loading the garments in the trunk of his car. Almost overnight, Mossimo shorts and shirts became the newest trend on Southern California beaches. The reason for their popularity, as near as anyone could determine, was the Mossimo name, which had transcended from absolute obscurity to a symbol of chic cachet in a matter of months. Though his quick success might have surprised Giannulli, the emergence of his Mossimo garments as a new fashion trend did not. From the start in his Balboa Island apartment, Giannulli was convinced of the wonders marketing could produce in the apparel industry. ""From day one,"" Giannulli explained, ""I have positioned this thing as a lifestyle company.""</p>\n\n<p>Drawing its marketing strength from the power of the Mossimo name, Giannulli\'s company recorded blistering sales growth during its first year of existence. By the end of his first year Giannulli had grossed $1 million and generated enough of a profit to pay back his father. By the end of 1989 sales had swelled fourfold to $4 million, infusing Giannulli with confidence and prompting him to test how far the popularity of the Mossimo name could carry him. He decided to expand his product line and thereby market the Mossimo name to a broader customer base, realizing that exponentially higher sales and his legitimacy as a clothing designer could only be achieved by diversifying beyond beachwear. Giannulli hired an experienced designer in 1991 and began manufacturing casual sportswear and accessories, adorning each item with the highly popular Mossimo name. The debut of Mossimo woven sweaters, knit shirts, and fleece sweatshirts marked a pivotal turning point in the company\'s development, moving Mossimo, Inc. from the activewear niche of the apparel industry to the decidedly larger sportswear segment. Concurrent with this shift in emphasis toward sportswear, Giannulli gradually began to move away from distributing his apparel to small surf and beachwear shops and focused instead on department stores and large specialty chains, his preferred retail locales. His diversification was a gamble, but the risk paid off. Consumers, mostly teenage customers, clamored for the new Mossimo line of sportswear and accessories, eager to purchase anything with the Mossimo label. In response, Giannulli increased prices and leveraged his success to obtain better deals from his suppliers. The result was an astounding level of profitability that by far eclipsed the net profit margins averaged by his rivals and made Mossimo, Inc. one of the most closely watched competitors in the apparel industry. ""I was given a pretty wonderful name,"" Giannulli remarked during an interview with<em> Daily News Record,</em> attempting to explain his success. ""If I was Tom, I don\'t know if we\'d be sitting here having this conversation--that was my brother\'s name and he\'s not here.""</p>\n\n<p>Annual sales by 1993 pushed past $20 million, providing Giannulli with the resources to hatch increasingly more ambitious plans. By this point the company had established its headquarters in Irvine, California, where a 4,600-square-foot factory produced Mossimo activewear, sportswear, and a growing collection of Mossimo accessories, such as eyewear, wallets, belts, bags, shoes, and hats. All of these items, plus the company\'s men\'s and women\'s sportswear, were showcased in Giannulli\'s newest creation--his own 2,600-square-foot retail store. Called Mossimo Supply, the store opened in December 1993 in a mall near Costa Mesa, which reportedly attracted 18 million visitors a year. There, amid other retail stores operated by Calvin Klein, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co., and Gucci, Giannulli\'s store stood, sharing space with some of the apparel industry\'s elite designers. Mossimo Supply\'s proximity to such company was by design. ""It\'s a good chance,"" Giannulli said, ""that somebody will walk out of Armani Exchange or <a href=""http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/polo-ralph-lauren-corporation-history/"">Ralph Lauren</a> and into our store."" Giannulli then offered a telling statement that revealed his professional desires and the future direction Mossimo, Inc. would take. ""I want to compete with those people in a big way,"" he said. In the coming years Mossimo, Inc. would be shaped by Giannulli\'s goal to become one of the industry\'s elite fashion designers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mid-1990s Growth and Public Offering</strong></p>\n\n<p>Any uncertainty regarding Giannulli\'s professional aspirations was eliminated after a 1994 interview with<em> Action Sports Retailer.</em> Giannulli said: ""When I look at Calvin [Klein] or Armani or Ralph Lauren, those are the companies I want to be associated with, and I\'m not settling for anything less. I will do everything in my power to get there."" To ascend the fashion world\'s hierarchy, Giannulli sought to legitimize himself as a designer through Mossimo, Inc., which appeared more than capable of supporting its founder\'s climb. On the retail front, another store was opened in New York City as part of Giannulli\'s plan to establish a retail presence in a handful of major metropolitan areas, including Dallas, San Francisco, and Chicago, but by 1995 neither of the company\'s stores had shown a profit, curbing plans for further expansion. Success in the retail field had been achieved, however, through another venture. Giannulli began opening shops within department stores, establishing his in-store shops in stores such as Macy\'s, the Bon MarchÃ©, and Dayton Hudson. By the beginning of 1995 there were more than 30 Mossimo in-store shops, selling an apparel line that reflected the ""new"" Mossimo, Inc. taking shape. By the mid-1990s, activewear--the T-shirts, shorts, and sweatshirts that once represented the entirety of Giannulli\'s business&amp;mdashcounted for 60 percent of sales, its contribution to the company\'s revenue volume decreasing with each passing year. The balance was derived from the sale of accessories and the company\'s sportswear line of knit and woven shirts and denim, which accounted for 34 percent of sales in 1995, up from 20 percent two years earlier. During this transition Mossimo, Inc.\'s sales shot upward, increasing at an annual compound rate of 46.6 percent during the first half of the 1990s to reach $110 million by 1995. Profits kept pace as well, primarily because consumers had demonstrated a willingness to pay increasingly higher prices for garments with the Mossimo name. In 1995 the company\'s net profit margin rested at 16 percent, far above the six percent averaged by rival Quicksilver and higher than the 13 percent recorded by Tommy Hilfiger, the fashion industry\'s phenom. It was against this backdrop of resounding success that Giannulli began, in earnest, to pursue his goal of becoming an upscale fashion designer.</p>\n\n<p>In the first nine months of 1995, Mossimo, Inc. opened 11 in-store shops in nine department stores and specialty chains, giving the company a total of 46 in-store retail locations. Giannulli wanted to establish more stores and he wanted to introduce a more sophisticated apparel line that would improve his standing in the fashion world. Both pursuits required money, so in December 1995 Giannulli announced his plans to sell shares in Mossimo, Inc. to the public, intending to use the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) to finance the establishment of new in-store shops, reduce debt, and pay for a new headquarters and distribution facility. The IPO was completed in February 1996, making 32-year-old Giannulli the youngest chief executive officer of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. More important, the IPO raised $36 million, more than twice the total expected when the public offering was announced two months earlier. Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock debuted at $18 a share and skyrocketed to $50 a share by June 1996, enriching investors exponentially in a four-month span. Giannulli and everyone associated with the company were ecstatic. One Wall Street analyst described Giannulli as the ""next Calvin Klein,"" precisely the recognition Giannulli had been seeking. To spark further enthusiasm, the company\'s prospects pointed to an even greater growth. The entire Mossimo collection was being distributed in Japan, Canada, and Australia, with an aggressive European expansion plan slated to begin in 1998. Before the push into Europe, Giannulli planned for a high-profile fashion show in New York City in 1997 and hired approximately a dozen designers and executives from competitors such as Calvin Klein and <a href=""http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/guess-inc-history/"">Guess</a>. It was difficult to imagine Mossimo, Inc. occupying a more enviable position than it did as the fall 1996 fashion season approached, but by the time the fall season did arrive, Giannulli found himself in desperate straits. Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock value began to plummet, stripping Giannulli of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Late 1990s Fall from Grace</strong></p>\n\n<p>When Mossimo, Inc. reported at the end of September 1996 that its profits were down nearly 50 percent for the third quarter, the company\'s stock plunged to $15 a share within a month. Giannulli, who owned 73.3 of Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock, saw his net worth reduced by $380 million. To blame were high production and development costs, which reduced earnings and caused the value of the company\'s stock to cascade downward. Giannulli conceded that ""we overdeveloped,"" but remained optimistic despite his huge financial loss, saying, ""ultimately we will hit the numbers."" Traded as a publicly owned company, Mossimo, Inc. needed to demonstrate consistent, quarterly profits to maintain its value, but after years of profitability as a privately held firm, the company failed to generate profits when profits were needed most. Critics cited the company\'s rapid expansion as the cause, explaining that operationally Mossimo, Inc. was ill-equipped to embark on the ambitious plans developed by Giannulli. Amid this criticism, Mossimo, Inc.\'s profits slid quarter by quarter, prompting one shareholder to file a lawsuit against the company, charging that Giannulli had ""completely lost control of the company\'s operations."" By February 1997--one year after the company\'s IPO--Mossimo, Inc.\'s stock had dipped below $9 a share, causing further anxiety. The company lost $498,000 during the first quarter of 1997, compared with a $5.8 million profit for the same period one year earlier. To combat chronically deteriorating profitability, Giannulli reverted to a page from his own history, rekindling memories of his days as an upstart operating out of a Balboa Island apartment.</p>\n\n<p>In May 1997, after closing his watch division, Giannulli announced plans for a new line of Mossimo activewear, the cotton T-shirts and swimwear that had given him his start. It was hoped that the introduction of this new, lower-priced line of activewear, combined with continuing efforts to reduce costs wherever possible, would arrest the company\'s perilous financial slide, but the losses continued to mount. By the fall of 1997, after posting a $4.8 million loss and a 46 percent decrease in sales for the company\'s third quarter, Giannulli had decided to seek help. ""I am looking for a really good operational head who will be in partnership with me,"" he announced. ""I want someone who will help us grow a long time, and stay for a while, not someone who will just come in and out of this joint."" Giannulli dropped the titles of president and chief executive officer in favor of the more ephemeral title of ""visionary,"" yet remained chairman as the search for a savior went forward. In January 1998 John P. Brincko, a turnaround specialist credited with reviving Barney\'s Inc. and Knudsen Foods, was hired as a consultant, arriving at a desperate juncture in Mossimo, Inc.\'s history. For the fourth quarter of 1997 the company expected to lose roughly $14 million, nearly identical to the sum it hoped to generate in sales. In March 1998 Brincko took over as president and chief executive officer, inheriting a company that lost $18.7 million in 1997 on $70.9 million in revenues, which represented a 34 percent decline from 1996\'s sales volume.</p>\n\n<p>By the time Brincko assumed operational control over the company, Giannulli\'s wealth had shriveled from $550 million in the summer of 1996 to $60 million. As Brincko scrutinized every aspect of Mossimo, Inc.\'s business, including distribution, marketing, production, sales, inventory, and financial management, Giannulli\'s Laguna Beach estate was up for sale, making his fall from the top more precipitous than the startling pace of his ascension. Looking ahead, Brincko was hoping for the turnaround he had been hired to execute, but the company\'s profitability problems continued to hobble progress as the end of 1998 approached.

Carel	Rostin Behnam	Individual	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/us-wildfires-financial-crisis-markets-cftc-report	"The devastating wildfires now sweeping across the western US are among the sparks from climate change that could ignite a financial crisis by damaging home values, state tourism and local government budgets, an advisory panel to a US markets regulator found.

Those effects could set off a cascade of events including defaults and market disruptions, undermining the economy and sparking a crisis, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

More than 85 significant fires are currently burning across the west, destroying communities in California, Oregon and Washington state.

“As we’ve seen in the past few weeks alone, extreme weather events continue to sweep the nation, from the severe wildfires of the west to the devastating midwest derecho and damaging Gulf coast hurricanes. This trend – which is increasingly becoming our new normal – will likely continue to worsen in frequency and intensity as a result of a changing climate,” said Rostin Behnam, CFTC commissioner.

“Beyond their physical devastation and tragic loss of human life and livelihood, escalating weather events also pose significant challenges to our financial system and our ability to sustain long-term economic growth,” said Behnam.

The CFTC sees climate change impacting the US economy in several major ways.

First, global warming is making the western US hotter and drier, with wildfires more frequent and intense, scientists say.

Economists have traditionally seen natural disasters like wildfires as localized shocks. That’s changing, according to the report, produced by a 35-member panel for the CFTC. The group included representatives of major oil companies, banks and asset managers.

Cal Fire, California’s firefighting agency, says about 3m of the state’s 12m homes are at high risk from wildfires.

That designation hurts home values, which in turn increases mortgage default risk, research cited by the report suggested.

More defaults would damage banks, mortgage holders and markets where mortgages are sold. Securities based on mortgages were a trigger for the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

After 2018, California’s worst fire season on record so far, in terms of loss of life and property, some insurers balked at renewing homeowner policies, forcing a record number of owners to turn to pricey policies from the state’s insurer of last resort.

Expensive insurance also depresses home prices, said former California insurance regulator Dave Jones, a contributor to the CFTC report.

“You can tell the same story in terms of sea level rise and flooding and more intense storms and their impact on residential real estate value,” said Jones, now a senior director at the Nature Conservancy.

In turn, lower home values reduce cities’ real estate tax revenue and impair their ability to repay debt, potentially leading to bond defaults.

Fire-related business disruptions such as a drop in tourism that slashed sales and lodging tax revenue could also hurt municipal finances.

Stresses could build in the US financial system in what the report termed “a systemic crisis in slow motion”.

Many Californians are experiencing orange skies, and shots such as darkened skies over San Francisco’s famous Golden Gate Bridge were beamed to television screens around the world, for example.

Climate catastrophes can make investors aware of risks not priced into markets, the report said, and this can “trigger a disorderly repricing of assets, which could have cascading effects on portfolios and balance sheets and, therefore, systemic implications for financial stability”.

“The central message of this report is that US financial regulators must recognize that climate change poses serious emerging risks to the US financial system, and they should move urgently and decisively to measure, understand, and address these risks,” the report concludes."

One can only say, “may there be more peace for Zimbabwe’s people, now that Robert Gabriel Mugabe has retired permanently”. Zimbabwe’s former president has died, aged 95.

His failures are legion. They might start with the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland and the Midlands, with perhaps 20 000 people killed.

Next, too much welfare spending in the 1980s. Then crudely implemented structural adjustment programmes in the 1990s, laying the ground for angry war veterans and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a strong labour union and civil society based opposition party.

In 1997 Mugabe handed out unbudgeted pensions to the war-vets and promised to really start the “fast track land reform” that got going in 2000, when the MDC threatened to defeat Zanu (PF) at the polls.

That abrogation of property rights started the slide in the Zimbabwean dollar’s value.

From 1998 to 2003 Zimbabwe’s participation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s second war cost US$1 million a day, creating a military cabal used to getting money fast.

Speedy money printing presses led to unfathomable hyperinflation and the end of Zimbabwe’s sovereign currency, still the albatross around the country’s neck.

In 2008, the MDC’s electoral victory was reversed with a presidential run-off when at least 170 opposition supporters were murdered.

Hundreds more were beaten and chased from their homes. Even Mugabe’s regional support base could not stand for that, so he was forced to accept a transitional inclusive government with the MDC.

Over the next decade, Mugabe was unable to stop his party’s increasing faction fighting. His years of playing one group off against the other to favour himself finally wore too thin.

When in early November 2017, at his wife Grace’s instigation, he fired his long-time lapdog Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the generals with whom he’d colluded for decades turned on him. A coup petit ensued and returned Mnangagwa from exile, soon to be elevated to the presidency and heavily indebted to his comrades.

Where did Mugabe gain his proclivity for factionalism? And how did he learn to speak the language all wanted to hear – only to make them realise they had been deluded in the end?

The beginning

Mugabe and many other Zimbabwean nationalists were jailed in 1964. Ian Smith was preparing for the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and the first nationalist party had split into Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African People’s Union and Ndabaningi Sithole’s Zanu. Mugabe had been Nkomo’s Publicity Secretary.

As far back as 1962, Mugabe was registering on the global scales: Salisbury’s resident British diplomat thought Mugabe was “a sinister figure” heading up a youthful “Zimbabwean Liberation Army … the more extreme wing of Zapu”.

But almost as soon as Mugabe was imprisoned, a man in her majesty’s employ travelled down from his advisory post in newly free Zambia to visit the prisoner. Dennis Grennan returned to Lusaka having promised to look after Mugabe’s wife Sarah, known as “Sally”. Grennan and people like Julius Nyerere’s British friend and assistant Joan Wicken played an important role in Mugabe’s rise.

The Zimbabwean nationalists emerged from Salisbury’s prisons late in 1974, as Portugal’s coup led to Angola and Mozambique emerging from colonialism into the Soviet orbit. The fifties generation of Zimbabwean nationalists were to participate in the Zambian and South African inspired détente exercise. This inspired much competition for Zanu’s leadership: Mugabe arrived in Lusaka after ousting Ndabaningi Sithole, Zanu’s first leader.

Samora Machel, freshly in Mozambique’s top office, wondered if Mugabe’s quick rise was due to a “coup in prison”. Herbert Chitepo’s March 1975 assassination (which got many of Zanu’s leaders arrested and its army kicked out of Zambia) was only one marker of the many fissures in the fractious party that by 1980 would rule Zimbabwe.

In late 1975 the vashandi group emerged within the Zimbabwean People’s Army. Based in Mozambique’s guerrilla camps, they tried to forge unity between Zimbabwe’s two main nationalist armies and push a left-wing agenda. They were profoundly unsure of Mugabe’s suitability for leadership.

When Mugabe found his way to Mozambique also in late 1975, Machel put him under house arrest in Quelimane, far from the guerrilla camps. In January Grennan helped him to London to visit a hospitalised Sally. He made contacts around Europe and with a few London-based Maoists.

Soon after Mugabe’s return the young American congressman Stephen Solarz and the Deputy Head of the American embassy in Maputo, Johnnie Carson, wended their way to Quelimane. Mugabe wowed them.

Solarz and Carson reported back that Mugabe was “an impressive, articulate and extremely confident individual” with a “philosophical approach to problems and … well reasoned arguments”. He claimed to control the “people’s army”.

Yet by January 1977, he persuaded Samora Machel to imprison the young advocates of unity with Zapu. His many reasons included their initial refusal to support him at a late 1976 conference in Geneva organised by the British, helped immeasurably by Henry Kissinger, the American Secretary of State.

At a hastily called congress in March 1977 to consecrate his ascension, Mugabe uttered his leitmotif: those appearing to attempt a change to the party’s leadership by “maliciously planting contradictions within our ranks” would be struck by the “the Zanu axe”.

This was Mugabe’s strategy, embedded at an early stage: tell foreign emissaries what they wanted to hear, use young radicals (or older allies) until their usefulness subsided, and then get rid of them.

All the while he would balance the other forces contending for power in the party amid a general climate of fear, distrust, and paranoia.

Dealing with dissent

It is not certain if Margaret Thatcher knew about this side of Mugabe when they met less than a month after his April 1980 inauguration.

He seemed most worried about how Joshua Nkomo’s Zapu – which he had dumped from the erstwhile “Patriotic Front”, and the violence against which had put Zimbabwe’s election in some doubt – was making life difficult for the new rulers. He warned that he might have “to act against them soon”.

In as much as Zapu was linked with the South African ANC and Thatcher and her colleagues tended to think the ANC was controlled by the South African Communist Party, Zapu intelligence chief Dumiso Dabengwa’s perspective might be more than conspiracy theory.

Perhaps Thatcher’s wink and nudge was a green light for the anti-Soviet contingent to eliminate a regional threat. Gukurahundi followed.

It was certainly the biggest blot on Mugabe’s career and created the biggest scar over Zimbabwe. The scar is still there, given the lack of any effort at reconcialitation, truth, or justice.

Four years later the ruling party’s first real congress since 1963 reviewed its history. Mugabe tore the Zipa/Vashandi group that had annoyed him eight years before to shreds. “Treacherous … counter-revolutionary … arms caching … dubbed us all zvigananda or bourgeois”. Thus it “became imperative for us to firmly act against them in defending the Party and the Revolution… We had all the trouble-makers detained”.

The great helmsman recounted the youthful dissenters’ arrest and repeated the axe phraseology.

But few saw these sides of Mugabe’s character soon enough; those who did were summarily shut up.

The end

After he’d been ousted, Mugabe could only look on in seeming despair over the ruination he had created.

Sanctimonious as ever he wondered how his successor, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, had become such an ogre.

At his 95th birthday, February 21 2019, a few weeks after Mnangagwa’s troops had killed 17 demonstrators, raped as many women, and beaten hundreds more in the wake of his beleaguered finance minister’s methods to create “prosperity from austerity”, Mugabe mused to his absent successor:

""We condemn the violence on civilians by soldiers … You can’t do without seeing dead bodies? What kind of a person are you? You feed on death?""

He only had to look into his own history to see what kind of people he helped create.

They might start with the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland and the Midlands, with perhaps\xa020 000 people killed.</p>\n\n<p>Next, too much welfare spending\xa0in the 1980s. Then crudely implemented\xa0structural adjustment programmes\xa0in the 1990s, laying the ground for angry war veterans and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a strong labour union and civil society based opposition party.</p>\n\n<p>In 1997 Mugabe handed out unbudgeted pensions to the war-vets and promised to really start the “fast track land reform” that got going\xa0in 2000, when the MDC threatened to defeat Zanu (PF) at the polls.</p>\n\n<p>That abrogation of property rights started the slide in the Zimbabwean dollar’s value.</p>\n\n<p>From 1998 to 2003 Zimbabwe’s participation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s second war cost US$1 million a day, creating a military cabal used to getting money fast.</p>\n\n<p>Speedy money printing presses led to\xa0unfathomable hyperinflation\xa0and the end of Zimbabwe’s sovereign currency, still the albatross around the country’s\xa0neck.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, the MDC’s electoral victory was reversed with a presidential run-off when at least 170 opposition supporters were murdered.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds more were beaten and\xa0chased from their homes. Even Mugabe’s regional support base could not stand for that, so he was forced to accept a\xa0transitional inclusive government\xa0with the MDC.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next decade, Mugabe was unable to stop his party’s increasing faction fighting. His years of playing one group off against the other to favour himself\xa0finally wore too thin.</p>\n\n<p>When in early November 2017, at his wife Grace’s instigation, he fired his long-time lapdog Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the generals with whom he’d colluded for decades turned on him. A\xa0coup petit\xa0ensued and returned Mnangagwa from exile, soon to be elevated to the presidency and heavily indebted to his comrades.</p>\n\n<p>Where did Mugabe gain his proclivity for factionalism? And how did he learn to speak the language all wanted to hear – only to make them realise they had been deluded in the end?</p>\n\n<h2>The beginning</h2>\n\n<p>Mugabe and many other Zimbabwean nationalists were jailed in 1964. Ian Smith was preparing for the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and the first nationalist party had split into Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African People’s Union and Ndabaningi Sithole’s Zanu. Mugabe had been Nkomo’s Publicity Secretary.</p>\n\n<p>As far back as 1962, Mugabe was registering on the global scales: Salisbury’s resident British diplomat\xa0thought Mugabe was\xa0“a sinister figure” heading up a youthful “Zimbabwean Liberation Army … the more extreme wing of Zapu”.</p>\n\n<p>But almost as soon as Mugabe was imprisoned, a man in her majesty’s employ travelled down from his advisory post in newly free Zambia to visit the prisoner. Dennis Grennan returned to Lusaka having\xa0promised\xa0to look after Mugabe’s wife Sarah, known as “Sally”. Grennan and people like Julius Nyerere’s British friend and assistant\xa0Joan Wicken\xa0played an important role in Mugabe’s rise.</p>\n\n<p>The Zimbabwean nationalists emerged from Salisbury’s prisons late in 1974, as Portugal’s coup led to Angola and Mozambique emerging from colonialism into the Soviet orbit. The fifties generation of Zimbabwean nationalists were to participate in the Zambian and South African inspired détente\xa0exercise. This inspired much competition for Zanu’s leadership: Mugabe arrived in Lusaka after ousting Ndabaningi Sithole, Zanu’s first leader.</p>\n\n<p>Samora Machel, freshly in Mozambique’s top office, wondered if Mugabe’s quick rise was due to a\xa0“coup in prison”. Herbert Chitepo’s March 1975\xa0assassination \xa0(which got many of Zanu’s leaders arrested and its army kicked out of Zambia) was only one marker of the many fissures in the fractious party that by 1980 would rule Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<p>In late 1975 the\xa0vashandi\xa0group emerged within the Zimbabwean People’s Army. Based in Mozambique’s guerrilla camps, they tried to forge unity between Zimbabwe’s two main nationalist armies and push a left-wing agenda. They were profoundly unsure of Mugabe’s suitability for\xa0leadership.</p>\n\n<p>When Mugabe found his way to Mozambique also in late 1975, Machel put him under house arrest in Quelimane, far from the guerrilla camps. In January Grennan helped him to London to visit a hospitalised Sally. He made contacts around Europe and with a few\xa0London-based Maoists.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after Mugabe’s return the young American congressman Stephen Solarz and the Deputy Head of the American embassy in Maputo, Johnnie Carson, wended their way to\xa0Quelimane. Mugabe wowed them.</p>\n\n<p>Solarz and Carson reported back that Mugabe was “an impressive, articulate and extremely confident individual” with a “philosophical approach to problems and … well reasoned arguments”. He claimed to control the “people’s army”.</p>\n\n<p>Yet by January 1977, he persuaded Samora Machel to imprison the young advocates of unity with Zapu. His many reasons included their initial refusal to support him at a late 1976 conference in Geneva organised by the British, helped immeasurably by Henry Kissinger, the American Secretary of State.</p>\n\n<p>At a hastily called congress in March 1977 to consecrate his ascension, Mugabe uttered his leitmotif: those appearing to attempt a change to the party’s leadership by “maliciously planting contradictions within our ranks” would be struck by the\xa0“the Zanu axe”.</p>\n\n<p>This was Mugabe’s strategy, embedded at an early stage: tell foreign emissaries what they wanted to hear, use young radicals (or older allies) until their usefulness subsided, and then get rid of them.</p>\n\n<p>All the while he would balance the other forces contending for power in the party amid a general climate of fear, distrust, and paranoia.</p>\n\n<h2>Dealing with dissent</h2>\n\n<p>It is not certain if Margaret Thatcher knew about this side of Mugabe when they met less than a month after his April 1980 inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>He seemed most worried about how Joshua Nkomo’s Zapu – which he had dumped from the erstwhile “Patriotic Front”, and the violence against which had put Zimbabwe’s election in some doubt – was making life difficult for the new rulers. He\xa0warned\xa0that he might have “to act against them soon”.</p>\n\n<p>In as much as Zapu was linked with the South African ANC and Thatcher and her colleagues tended to think the ANC was controlled by the South African Communist Party, Zapu intelligence chief\xa0Dumiso Dabengwa’s\xa0perspective might be more than conspiracy theory.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Thatcher’s wink and nudge was a green light for the anti-Soviet contingent to eliminate a regional threat. Gukurahundi\xa0followed.</p>\n\n<p>It was certainly the biggest blot on Mugabe’s career and created the biggest scar over Zimbabwe. The scar is still there, given the lack of any effort at reconcialitation, truth, or justice.</p>\n\n<p>Four years later the ruling party’s first real congress since 1963 reviewed its history. Mugabe tore the Zipa/Vashandi group that had annoyed him eight years before to shreds. “Treacherous … counter-revolutionary … arms caching … dubbed us all\xa0zvigananda\xa0or bourgeois”. Thus it “became imperative for us to firmly act against them in defending the Party and the Revolution… We had all the trouble-makers detained”.</p>\n\n<p>The great helmsman recounted the youthful dissenters’ arrest and repeated the axe phraseology.</p>\n\n<p>But few saw these sides of Mugabe’s character soon enough; those who did were summarily shut up.</p>\n\n<h2>The end</h2>\n\n<p>After he’d been ousted, Mugabe could only look on in seeming despair over the ruination he had created.</p>\n\n<p>Sanctimonious as ever he wondered how his successor, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, had become such an ogre.</p>\n\n<p>At his 95th birthday, February 21 2019, a few weeks after Mnangagwa’s troops had killed 17 demonstrators, raped as many women, and beaten hundreds more in the wake of his beleaguered finance minister’s methods to create\xa0“prosperity from austerity”, Mugabe\xa0mused to his absent successor:</p>\n\n<p><em>""We condemn the violence on civilians by soldiers … You can’t do without seeing dead bodies? What kind of a person are you? You feed on death?""</em></p>\n\n<p>He only had to look into his own history to see what kind of people he helped create.</p>\n\n<p>David B.

Sebastien	Robert Gabriel Mugabe	individual	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/robert-mugabe-death-hero-tyrant-zimbabwe-hopewell-chinono	"obert Mugabe is dead, never to come back again, and so are millions of Zimbabweans who preceded him, dying from easily treatable diseases, and from the violence that visited anyone who attempted to resist his tyrannical rule.

The dreams of millions of young men and women – who, to this day, roam the streets of Zimbabwe with university degrees but without jobs or any decent income – were extinguished long before him.

The fact that Mugabe died in a Singaporean hospital is the final act of betrayal by a dictator who destroyed the health system of a country that had saved many lives in the first 15 years of his repressive rule.

Yet he died overseas, where his healthcare needs blew millions of taxpayer dollars. The same taxpayer, meanwhile, can’t even get a painkiller in Zimbabwean public hospitals.

Mugabe was the face of the Zanu-PF government’s violence, and he performed his role with decadent gusto. He built an evil yet extremely strong system of governance that has outlived him: since his inglorious departure, its signature acts of violence and torture have continued under Emmerson Mnangagwa.

In fact, anyone who might have expected life for the Zimbabwean citizen to have improved following his humiliating removal from power in a 2017 military coup will be disappointed to learn that, far from getting better, things have got worse.

I first heard about Mugabe in the late 1970s when I was a boy growing up in colonial Rhodesia. My father, a civil servant, used to listen religiously to Radio Zimbabwe, which broadcast from the Mozambican capital of Maputo. The station broadcast liberation war propaganda, and was run by Mugabe’s party, the Zimbabwe African National Union, Zanu.

Mugabe constantly gave motivational speeches to encourage the African population in Rhodesia to be resolute against colonial rule, and to work hand in glove with his guerrilla fighters. He was undoubtedly a hero to many black people in Rhodesia; a self-styled Marxist-Leninist guerrilla war fighter, he used to bellow into African homes via Radio Zimbabwe, and the black people of Rhodesia held him in awe. However, unlike Samora Machel, who hosted Zanu and its military wing in Mozambique, Mugabe was an intellectual revolutionary who never fired a gun in the field.

Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe, as he liked to be addressed, took over a country at independence that had a strong economy, second only to South Africa in the region.

His country was known as the breadbasket of southern Africa, with a mechanised farming sector that was the bedrock of its economy and second to none. The economy had robust light and heavy industry sectors that had been built and accentuated on the back of a colonial import substitution policy, which successfully frustrated UN sanctions against Rhodesia.

The list of Zimbabwe’s brokenness is long, and it is a list that defines Mugabe’s legacy and violent reign

At independence, Zimbabwe provided jobs to all who wished to work, but Mugabe’s most important legacy was an education policy that gave access to all Zimbabweans who desired to better their lives through formal education.

This created one of Africa’s most revolutionary education stories. It made Zimbabwe the African leader in literacy. Healthcare was available to all who needed it. Mugabe, however, turned his back on these early achievements and squandered their legacy. His rule became defined by bloody, murderous excesses that claimed thousands of lives and were largely ignored by the west; by political repression and a tanking economy.

Today Zimbabwe is a failed state because it has no capability of providing services to its people. The government-controlled power company can only provide six hours of electricity a day. Hospitals have been turned into death traps; there is no medication for the poorest of the poor. The country can’t even provide passports for those who want to leave – the home affairs ministry can only produce 80 a day, where 8,000 should be normal.

There is no fuel due to an acute shortage of foreign exchange caused by corruption and lack of investment. Long queues are a daily reality. The unemployment rate hovers around 90-95%, with many Zimbabweans who are educated to degree level selling newspapers and cigarettes at street corners. Inflation stands at around 550% a year and most food is beyond the reach of the poor. Teachers earn an equivalent of £23 a month and doctors are paid £87.

Back in the day, Zimbabwe and Nigeria were the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa that had television; today Zimbabwe is the only country of significance without commercial television. The list of Zimbabwe’s brokenness is long, and it is a list that defines Mugabe’s legacy and violent reign. He will not be mourned by millions of Zimbabweans who still suffer the consequences of his incompetent and corrupt rule."

Canberk	Mamuka Khazaradze	Person	https://eurasianet.org/perspectives-arbitrations-are-not-a-good-look-for-georgia	"Georgia needs the port. And if it doesn’t want to find itself sucked into a Chinese debt trap, it needs to stop tussling with Western investors. The arbitration filings came just days after Tbilisi backed down in another conflict with another investor, Frontera, an American oil company – under myopic pressure from Washington.

This latest escalation in the bitter public dispute over Anaklia is a blow to Georgia’s national security for two reasons.

First, it is yet more evidence that Anaklia will not be built anytime soon; the arbitration process will make it difficult for the government to attract new investors. As the country’s first deep-water port, Anaklia is an essential part of Georgia’s plan to transform itself into a transit hub between Europe and Asia, a strategy intended to boost trade, integrate deeper in the Euro-Atlantic economic system, and ultimately pull Georgia out of Russia’s sphere of influence.

The move by the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC) – which was founded by a rival to the head of Georgia’s ruling party – came after the government blamed it for failing to raise enough money for the port and terminated its contract in January. ADC, for its part, maintains that the government made it impossible to attract investors.

The Anaklia saga also undermines Georgia’s security by damaging its reputation as a safe place to invest. Georgian officials like to boast about their country’s free trade agreements and high place in ease of doing business rankings. The ability to attract foreign investors not only spurs growth, it creates connections with American and European business communities and spares Georgia from having to accept predatory loans from China to build new infrastructure.

The ruling Georgian Dream party has always claimed it supports Anaklia. Behind the scenes, however, it has appeared to sabotage the project by refusing to provide guarantees to international financial institutions, and launching what smells like a politically motivated money laundering investigation against former ADC chairman Mamuka Khazaradze. Clearly there is a personal rivalry between Khazaradze, who has started his own political party, and the head of Georgian Dream, Georgia’s de-facto leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.

The fact that such a strategically important project was derailed by domestic political squabbling does not reflect well on Georgia. Foreign firms will be less likely to invest there, especially in things like infrastructure projects which require long-term commitments. This should be a grave concern for Georgia, where FDI inflows have already fallen from an average of $1.8 billion per year between 2014 and 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019, according to government data.

Access to Western investors, businesses, and insurers – which requires those actors to believe they will be treated fairly – is a vital economic and security asset for Georgia. Investors bring more than capital and expertise; they form connections between business communities in Georgia and the West which in turn create political connections. If the steady march of bad press about Anaklia dissuades some Western firms from investing in Georgia, the country will be forced to choose between slower economic growth and new benefactors.

The obvious choice would be China, with its deep coffers and penchant for investing in dysfunctional countries along trade routes to Europe. This is not just a far-fetched hypothetical. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has cited the risk of Georgia “falling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influence” as one reason Anaklia is so important. Chinese investment in Georgia would invite the same concerns about debt traps, a lack of transparency, and political influence that accompany Chinese investments everywhere.

Georgia is still a success story for democracy and free enterprise in a tough neighborhood. The Anaklia fiasco is a step backwards. Georgians must now recognize the danger of politicizing critical investments. Parliamentary elections in October are the perfect opportunity to voice support for Anaklia and for keeping their country open to foreign businesses.

Georgia’s friends in Washington, meanwhile, should provide the kind of guidance that is based on principle, not favoritism. In April, Georgia prevailed in an arbitration dispute with Frontera, the American oil company, which the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration found had failed to pay wages and engaged in other unscrupulous behavior over the years. Instead of supporting Georgia’s efforts to move on, some members of Congress (who took contributions from Frontera), tried to get the State Department to withhold aid to Tbilisi, tying – improbably – the Frontera dispute to Russia. Tbilisi had no choice but to cave.

That’s how Beijing and Moscow do business. If Washington wants Georgia to succeed as a transparent and free democracy, it should support the country’s efforts to play by the rules – and support negotiations with the Anaklia Development Consortium."

And if it doesn’t want to find itself sucked into a Chinese debt trap, it needs to stop tussling with Western investors. The arbitration filings came just days after Tbilisi backed down in another conflict with another investor, Frontera, an American oil company – <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/following-pressure-from-washington-georgia-reverses-course-on-us-energy-company"">under myopic pressure</a> from Washington.</p>\n\n<p>This latest escalation in the bitter public dispute over Anaklia is a blow to Georgia’s national security for two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>First, it is yet more evidence that Anaklia will not be built anytime soon; the arbitration process will make it difficult for the government to attract <a href=""https://agenda.ge/en/news/2020/494"">new investors</a>. As the country’s first deep-water port, Anaklia is an essential part of Georgia’s plan to transform itself into a transit hub between Europe and Asia, a strategy intended to boost trade, integrate deeper in the Euro-Atlantic economic system, and ultimately pull Georgia out of Russia’s sphere of influence.</p>\n\n<p>The move by the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC) – which was founded by a rival to the head of Georgia’s ruling party – came after the government blamed it for failing to raise enough money for the port and <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/georgia-cancels-contract-for-black-sea-megaport"">terminated</a> its contract in January. ADC, for its part, maintains that the government made it impossible to attract investors.</p>\n\n<p>The Anaklia saga also undermines Georgia’s security by damaging its reputation as a safe place to invest. Georgian officials like to boast about their country’s free trade agreements and high place in ease of doing business rankings. The ability to attract foreign investors not only spurs growth, it creates connections with American and European business communities and spares Georgia from having to accept predatory loans from China to build new infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling Georgian Dream party has always claimed it supports Anaklia. Behind the scenes, however, it has appeared to <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/georgias-anaklia-port-claims-government-sabotage"">sabotage</a> the project by refusing to provide guarantees to international financial institutions, and launching what smells like a politically motivated money laundering investigation against former ADC chairman Mamuka Khazaradze. Clearly there is a <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/in-georgian-politics-its-millionaire-vs-billionaire"">personal rivalry</a> between Khazaradze, who has <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/georgias-third-option"">started his own political party</a>, and the head of Georgian Dream, Georgia’s de-facto leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that such a strategically important project was derailed by domestic political squabbling does not reflect well on Georgia. Foreign firms will be less likely to invest there, especially in things like infrastructure projects which require long-term commitments. This should be a grave concern for Georgia, where FDI inflows have already fallen from an average of $1.8 billion per year between 2014 and 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019, according to <a href=""https://www.geostat.ge/en/modules/categories/191/foreign-direct-investments"">government data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Access to Western investors, businesses, and insurers – which requires those actors to believe they will be treated fairly – is a vital economic and security asset for Georgia. Investors bring more than capital and expertise; they form connections between business communities in Georgia and the West which in turn create political connections. If the steady march of bad press about Anaklia dissuades some Western firms from investing in Georgia, the country will be forced to choose between slower economic growth and new benefactors.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious choice would be China, with its deep coffers and penchant for investing in dysfunctional countries along trade routes to Europe. This is not just a far-fetched hypothetical. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has <a href=""https://www.state.gov/statements-to-the-press-with-georgian-prime-minister-mamuka-bakhtadze-as-part-of-the-u-s-georgia-strategic-partnership-commission/"">cited</a> the risk of Georgia “falling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influence” as one reason Anaklia is so important. Chinese investment in Georgia would invite the same concerns about debt traps, a lack of transparency, and political influence that accompany Chinese investments everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia is still a success story for democracy and free enterprise in a tough neighborhood. The Anaklia fiasco is a step backwards. Georgians must now recognize the danger of politicizing critical investments. Parliamentary elections in October are the perfect opportunity to voice support for Anaklia and for keeping their country open to foreign businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia’s friends in Washington, meanwhile, should provide the kind of guidance that is based on principle, not favoritism. In April, Georgia prevailed in an arbitration dispute with Frontera, the American oil company, which the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration found had failed to pay wages and engaged in other unscrupulous behavior over the years. Instead of supporting Georgia’s efforts to move on, some members of Congress (who took contributions from Frontera), <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/threat-of-conditions-on-us-aid-roils-georgia"">tried to get</a> the State Department to withhold aid to Tbilisi, tying – improbably – the Frontera dispute to Russia. Tbilisi had no choice but <a href=""https://eurasianet.org/following-pressure-from-washington-georgia-reverses-course-on-us-energy-company"">to cave</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s how Beijing and Moscow do business. If Washington wants Georgia to succeed as a transparent and free democracy, it should support the country’s efforts to play by the rules – and support negotiations with the Anaklia Development Consortium.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': 'Aug 11, 2020', 'datePublishedRaw': 'Aug 10, 2020'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}, {'code': 'uz'}, {'code': 'ru'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	random	the mention of Khazaradze is minimal, and not clear	Sebastien		Perspectives | Arbitrations are not a good look for Georgia
Sebastien	Ravindra Kishore Sinha	individual	https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/bjps-rk-sinha-promotes-debunked-covid-19-claim-through-facebook-ads-8439	"Ravindra Kishore Sinha, a former member of Rajya Sabha for the Bharatiya Janata Party's Bihar unit, recently promoted a series of misleading articles written by him through Facebook, where he brings up an already-debunked theory on SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic - being a human-made virus.

Sinha backs his theory by claiming that Japanese Nobel Laureate Tasuku Honjo had declared that the coronavirus behind COVID-19 is not natural, but human-made. In April, BOOM had already fact checked this claim and found it to be false.

While Facebook had stated earlier this year that it would not fact-check political ads, in March the company had pledged to limited the spread of misinformation and hoaxes around COVID-19. However, Sinha's political ads, openly spreading misinformation around the pandemic, have been allowed to run, with some of them still being active.

Is Someone Spreading Fake News?

BOOM spotted an Instagram post from Sinha's account, which is a screenshot of an opinion piece, titled, ""Is China hiding something?"", with Sinha's photo and his name in the by-line. The screenshot of the article, written for a publication named Business Ocean, was shared with the following caption:

""Japan's Nobel prize winner doctor has claimed that the #Coronavirus is made by China to create havoc globally. Read my article published in ' The Avenue Mail' on this matter.""

Sinha also shared the same screenshot from his official Twitter handle, stating, ""China made the #Coronavirus to attack the whole world without firing a missile,"" in the caption. BOOM, however, did not find any trace of a publication called Business Ocean on the internet, with the exception of this listing in Sulekha - a website containing details of companies and businesses around the country.

We also found a Facebook post that carried an article with the exact same headline, written for an Assam-based newspaper called The Hills Times. He writes:

""Dr. Tasuku Honjo, who is a Professor in Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine at the Kyoto University in Japan and received the Nobel Prize for Immunology, is reported to have said that this virus is man-made and that it has nothing to do with bats.""

Sinha also mentions in the article that Hanjo himself had worked in the ""Laboratory of Virology"" of Wuhan - a reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology, that has been the subject of many conspiracy theories around the pandemic.

Here are some examples of the misleading posts promoted by Sinha's page:

Sinha's official Facebook page, with over 15 lakh followers, was found to promote at least 13 different articles by various publications/websites, which carried this conspiracy theory.

Fact Check

The rumours regarding Dr. Tasuku Hanjo making such a statement has been going around on social media since April 2020. On April 26, BOOM published a fact check, debunking this rumour and putting it to rest. Here is what we found:

BOOM visited the Nobel laureate's profile on the Nobel Prize winning website and the Kyoto University website to understand if he had ever collaborated with the Wuhan laboratory. However, there is no mention of Honjo working or collaborating with the Wuhan laboratory.

We also wrote to Honjo, as well as Kyoto University. The University refuted this claim and shared Honjo's official statement, where he said said that he was deeply saddened that his, as well as the University's name was used to spread misinformation.

""At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting,"" Honjo stated.

There is absolutely no evidence supporting the claim that Honjo made any claims relating to the origin of the COVID-19. However, we found that another Nobel Laureate - French virologist Luc Montagneir, had claimed in an interview that the virus seems to have originated in a laboratory.

In The Hill Times article, Sinha wrote while referring to Honjo, ""A report of his denial was circulated in social media subsequently but it was not taken seriously by many."" He however, failed to mention that the denial was official, and that it came from Honjo himself, which was published by Kyoto University.

Furthermore, he also adds in the article, ""In the light of this and the statement of France's scientist...."", making a dubious reference to Montagnier. However, the article does not mention his name at all.

BOOM reached out to the numbers mentioned in the disclaimers of the ads ran on Facebook by Sinha's page, but did not receive a response. We also reached out to Sinha through email and the article will be updated if and when he responds.

Given that Sinha's posts are political in nature, while also carrying misleading information around COVID-19, we reached out to Facebook to get a comment on whether such posts could be allowed under the garb of political ads. The article will be updated upon getting a response."

Sebastien	Robert Gabriel Mugabe	individual	https://www.theglobalist.com/africa-zimbabwe-robert-mugabe-corruption/	"Former Zimbabwean president Robert Gabriel Mugabe finally fell on Tuesday. His spectacular downfall closed a chapter of Africa’s 1960s leaders who successfully liberated the masses, only to transform into some of the worst despots that these countries had seen.

Such a list includes late Malawian president Hastings Kamuzu Banda and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni.

It is particularly sad that Mugabe had to go the way he did. After all, this is a man who on taking over as the country’s head of state, ensured that Zimbabweans had an education system that was the envy of the continent.

He also stood against former colonisers and the might of the apartheid state to ensure that the whole of southern Africa was liberated.

For some strange reasons Mugabe is a victim of his own making. After raising his status as a regional power broker he succumbed to the attractions of self enrichment, while his nation fell into poverty.

The list of his critical misdemeanours stretches from his wife Grace, to his children who continue to live as if there is no tomorrow.

Zimbabwe’s second independence

So when Zimbabweans call the end of his era the second independence, it is understandable for a population that has not known any other leader but Mugabe.

But it also cast a spot on a rather impressive record of Africa’s visionaries such as Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere and Nnamdi Azikiwe, whose battle cry over the years was that Africa’s political liberation had to be followed by the economic emancipation of her children.

They emphasised that Pan-Africanism was critical to the continent’s economic and social progress.

It is this trajectory that has given way to a new era where the commitment to the selfless development of a people has been replaced by personal interests. Should the continent be worried? Should we be scared? Perhaps.

Mugabe’s era also indicated that Africa could be moving from a strategic path towards the collective development, and to self benefit. Talks about the free movement of goods and people across the continent seems to have given way to sectoral interests.

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki’s celebrated African Renaissance seems to be a thing of the past. It is a worrying trend, because it leaves the continent with no immediate economic recovery plan.

Obliterated

When Europe was obliterated to ashes by the ravages of World War II, the West came together and produced a plan to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernise industry and make the region more prosperous.

One of the key elements of the Marshall Plan was to discourage military coups (although these eventually took place in Turkey and Greece). It emphasised peace and democracy and encouraged dialogue between warring factions.

Something akin to what African Renaissance sought to do. Sadly, the African Union this week described the military takeover of Zimbabwe as intervention, endorsing the very people who have butchered the country and plundered its prospects to nothing.

The fact that the military carefully choreographed Mugabe’s exit from power does not take away its own complicity in Zimbabwe’s economic downturn.

The generals were some of the biggest beneficiaries of Zimbabwe’s chaotic land reform program that plunged the country from a bread basket into a basket case.

Together with Mugabe, they masterminded one of the bloodiest repressions against Zimbabweans. They also got well rewarded for assisting in the general plundering of national resources that brought the country to its knees and cost it some of its best brains to the four corners of the world.

In Mugabe’s world, it was okay for the rest of the population to live in abject poverty while he and his military backers lived comfortably.

Political elite

The incoming Emmerson Mnangagwa also helped Mugabe in ensuring that the rule of law only favoured the political elite. It is an era that has become all too familiar on the continent.

It is currently playing itself out in South African television screens where the parliamentary select committee on public enterprises is probing how a select few individuals came to reap benefits that were meant for all.

Nearly every witness has told of how they were called into meetings with the Guptas to sway tenders and businesses in the politically connected family’s favour.

It is the modern politics of greed that has replaced a common purpose among many African states. It is characterised by how a minority lives an opulent life in the midst of poverty.

Obscene excesses

Just recently, Mugabe’s son, Chatunga, poured champagne on his $60,000 wrist watch, and proceeded to tell whoever cared to listen that he could do so because of his dad’s status.

Chatunga and his brother Robert Jr. are particularly known as centres of attraction in South Africa’s most exclusive nightclubs, where they binge on the most expensive of wines, while Zimbabweans continue to live on less than a dollar a day.

The richest woman in Africa, Isabel dos Santos, is the daughter of former Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos – who ruled the African country for 38 years before stepping down last August.

In pre-Arab Spring Libya, Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif was rumoured by Forbes magazine to be a billionaire who owned luxury villas as far afield as Vienna and counted a white pet tiger among his personal possessions.

President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, is probably one of a few millionaires in the world who has amassed a massive pile of wealth without any discernible entrepreneurial skill.

So while Mugabe’s downfall should be celebrated, it should at the same time be a chance for the continent to review its vision and to come out with a plan that will constrain military interventions, while encouraging openness and dialogue among its nations.

But that can only happen if our leaders master a political will to do so."

His spectacular downfall closed a chapter of Africa’s 1960s leaders who successfully liberated the masses, only to transform into some of the worst despots that these countries had seen.</p>\n\n<p>Such a list includes late Malawian president Hastings Kamuzu Banda and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni.</p>\n\n<p>It is particularly sad that Mugabe had to go the way he did. After all, this is a man who on taking over as the country’s head of state, ensured that Zimbabweans had an education system that was the <a href=""https://www.theglobalist.com/africa-zimbabwe-robert-mugabe-military-coup-corruption/""><strong>envy of the continent.</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>He also stood against former colonisers and the might of the apartheid state to ensure that the whole of southern Africa was liberated.</p>\n\n<p>For some strange reasons Mugabe is a victim of his own making. After raising his status as a regional power broker he succumbed to the attractions of self enrichment, while his nation fell into poverty.</p>\n\n<p>The list of his critical misdemeanours stretches from his wife Grace, to his children who continue to live as if there is no tomorrow.</p>\n\n<h2>Zimbabwe’s second independence</h2>\n\n<p>So when Zimbabweans call the end of his era the second independence, it is understandable for a population that has not known any other leader but Mugabe.</p>\n\n<p>But it also cast a spot on a rather impressive record of Africa’s visionaries such as Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere and Nnamdi Azikiwe, whose battle cry over the years was that Africa’s political liberation had to be followed by the economic emancipation of her children.</p>\n\n<p>They emphasised that Pan-Africanism was critical to the continent’s economic and social progress.</p>\n\n<p>It is this trajectory that has given way to a new era where the commitment to the selfless development of a people has been replaced by personal interests. Should the continent be worried? Should we be scared? Perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>Mugabe’s era also indicated that Africa could be moving from a strategic path towards the collective development, and to self benefit. Talks about the free movement of goods and people across the continent seems to have given way to sectoral interests.</p>\n\n<p>Former South African president Thabo Mbeki’s celebrated African Renaissance seems to be a thing of the past. It is a worrying trend, because it leaves the continent with no immediate economic recovery plan.</p>\n\n<h2>Obliterated</h2>\n\n<p>When Europe was obliterated to ashes by the ravages of World War II, the West came together and produced a plan to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernise industry and make the region more prosperous.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key elements of the Marshall Plan was to discourage military coups (although these eventually took place in Turkey and Greece). It emphasised peace and democracy and encouraged dialogue between warring factions.</p>\n\n<p>Something akin to what African Renaissance sought to do. Sadly, the African Union this week described the military takeover of Zimbabwe as intervention, endorsing the very people who have butchered the country and plundered its prospects to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the military carefully choreographed Mugabe’s exit from power does not take away its own complicity in Zimbabwe’s economic downturn.</p>\n\n<p>The generals were some of the biggest beneficiaries of Zimbabwe’s chaotic land reform program that plunged the country from a bread basket into a basket case.</p>\n\n<p>Together with Mugabe, they masterminded one of the bloodiest repressions against Zimbabweans.

Sebastien	Robert Gabriel Mugabe	individual	http://www.thezimbabwenewslive.com/businessman-who-killed-robert-mugabe-and-peter-pamire-is-exposed/	"VANCOUVER – Founding Zimbabwe President, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, was reportedly toppled from power and had his life prematurely ended by a close but false family “relative” who is extremely deeply involved with the occult, Spotlight Zimbabwe, has reported.

The suspicious rogue relative according to a disgruntled Mugabe family member who declined to be named, due to the sensitivity of the matter, is a well known dubious businessman in Harare, with questionable business interests in real estate, agriculture, and sports, including a stint in football management.

The Mugabe family member, currently residing outside the country said, the country’s former president was sacrificed as a blood offering or ritual by this fake and imposter relative, who is said to be practicing satanism in broad day light.

“President Robert Mugabe, was not removed from power through a mere coup as we all believe,” said the Mugabe family member currently pursuing business in South Africa and here in Canada.

“All I can say is that our president was dethroned from office through satanic means, by people we trusted and loved and regarded as relatives to the family. The particular person involved and really responsible for the 2017 coup that removed president Mugabe from office, is a man who organised the official visit of a world pop-star in Zimbabwe.”

The hurting Mugabe family member, who is back home in Harare to attend to a Mugabe remembrance ceremony, said the rogue relative who masterminded Mugabe’s political downfall and death is also allegedly responsible for the death of pioneering local business mogul, Peter Pamire, who died in a freak car accident in 1997.
Pamire was a prominent Zimbabwean entrepreneur who is credited for having been one of the first Zimbabweans to call for black empowerment, and was influential in the formation of the black empowerment lobby group, Affirmative Action Group (AAG) in 1994.

Pamire died in a car crash on March 9, 1997 after his car brakes failed him resulting in the accident which claimed his life. It is said that Pamire’s Mitsubishi Pajero developed a technical problem and overturned along Addington Lane in Ballantyne Park, Borrowdale.

There were widespread speculations that the car that he was driving was tempered with before the accident actually happened. It was also claimed that about twenty people testified on the case forcing the judge to order a thorough investigation but the investigation never took off, according to Pindula News.

“There have been a lot of conspiracy theories about the death of Pamire, some of the speculations claimed that his vehicle overturned after he had been shot while coming from the Harare International Airport,” the news agency reports.
“It also emerged that forensic analysts had ruled out the death being a result of an accident but were due to foul play, however the widespread rumours were unsubstantiated as there was no evidence which was brought forward. Among some of the rumours surrounding the death of Pamire were allegations that he was having an affair with the former first lady Grace Mugabe before the time of his death.”

“We’re talking about a devil worshiper here, said the former President’s family member.
“Aifunga kuti takapata (he thought that we were foolish) asi ayirasa (he has lost it). Judgement day is coming. Munhu upi asinganyare (He has no shame). President Mugabe innocently visited his dilapidating mansion in Borrowdale, that’s the occasion he used to bewitch the president. This living demon is dangerous and controls Zimbabwe from the spiritual realm. Even the current leader of our nation pays homage to him, because he was put in power by this wicked man, who Mnangagwa has even made a parliamentarian. So you might think that Mnangagwa has power, that’s a dream, this rogue who killed Mugabe is micro-managing Mnangagwa from the spiritual and occultic realm.”

“This loser at one time claimed to be the first African to drive a certain BMW model, izvo zviri zvemushonga izvo (it’s all juju). God will be the judge. Munhu uyu ayenderera(This person has gone too far). He has a spiritual stronghold on all founding and current leaders of the AAG.

He was 95.

Zimbabwe’s current leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, announced the death on Twitter but did not disclose the cause. Mr. Mugabe, who had displayed physical decline over recent years, had been receiving hospital treatment in Singapore since April, Mnangagwa said last month. Singapore’s Foreign Ministry said his body would be flown back to Zimbabwe.

Mr. Mugabe was forced to resign as Zimbabwe’s leader days after the army staged a coup in November 2017. At the time, he was the world’s oldest head of state and one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders.

Mnangagwa, who served as Mr. Mugabe’s vice president, is a wily and resilient veteran of Zimbabwe’s independence war who once led the feared internal security service. Nicknamed “the Crocodile” for his quick-to-strike survival skills, Mnangagwa replaced the ailing Mr. Mugabe in the 2017 coup, then was narrowly elected president last year.

Mnangagwa has struggled to achieve the economic recovery he promised and has cracked down on opponents with some of the same repressive measures Mr. Mugabe’s regime wielded, causing some Zimbabweans to say they missed Mr. Mugabe.

Mr. Mugabe’s fall marked the end of one of the last surviving “Big Men” of the continent, the onetime revolutionary leaders who inherited the security apparatus of their former colonial rulers and used an iron fist to enrich themselves and repress their citizens.

In 1980, Mr. Mugabe took power in what was once white-minority-ruled Southern Rhodesia after a protracted civil war. He pledged pragmatism and reconciliation. But after a promising start, the country once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa descended into a nightmare of widespread unemployment, hyperinflation, hunger and disease.

Mr. Mugabe and his cronies unleashed gangs of armed thugs to beat up, torture and kill their political foes, while suffocating Zimbabwe’s fledgling democratic institutions. The regime used food aid as a way to reward supporters and starve opponents. Epidemics of AIDS and cholera ravaged rural areas, and the country’s once-thriving commercial farms were gutted.

Cities swelled with hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the countryside. In 2005, Mr. Mugabe pitilessly carried out “Operation Drive Out the Trash,” an urban beautification effort that made hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers homeless.

Cars waited in line for days outside filling stations, rationing left most people with electricity only every other day, and residents went shopping with suitcases filled with almost worthless currency, its value falling by the hour.

Mugabe resigns under military pressure after 37 years as Zimbabwe’s leader

Mr. Mugabe blamed those ills and more on a long list of enemies, foreign and domestic, while portraying himself as a beleaguered African hero. He conjured a paranoid vision of a major conspiracy led by white farmers and business executives and their black political puppets, and funded by evil governments in London and Washington.

But Mr. Mugabe’s downfall came not at the hands of foreign enemies but from his once-loyal generals. They rebelled against his attempt to install his mercurial wife, Grace Mugabe, as his successor, and placed him under house arrest. Thousands marched in the streets to support Mr. Mugabe’s ouster, while his former allies in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) expelled him from his role as party chairman, an ignominious collapse for the only elected leader Zimbabwe had ever known.

As he steered his country over a cliff, many observers puzzled over how a leader once considered principled, intelligent and incorruptible could have descended so far and so quickly. But the seeds of Mr. Mugabe’s ruinous reign were there almost from the start.

A rebel rises to power

The son of a carpenter, Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born Feb. 21, 1924, in the village of Kutama in what was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.

He was educated in Jesuit missionary schools and in 1951 graduated from South Africa’s University of Fort Hare, Nelson Mandela’s alma mater and the incubator for a generation of activists who led the struggle against white-
minority regimes throughout southern Africa. (Mr. Mugabe later earned several other degrees, some while in prison.)

He returned to Rhodesia in 1960 and joined the Zimbabwe African People’s Union, the dominant black liberation movement led by Joshua Nkomo. But stifled by Nkomo’s autocratic leadership, Mr. Mugabe and a group of insurgents walked out three years later to form the rival ZANU-PF.

Rhodesia’s white-minority government under Prime Minister Ian Smith defied the winds of change that swept across Africa in the early 1960s and unilaterally declared its independence from Britain in 1965, locking up thousands of political opponents. Mr. Mugabe spent more than 10 years in prison without trial. While he was incarcerated, his young son died in 1966 of a form of malaria, and he was denied permission to attend the funeral.

In 1972, the conflict between Smith’s government and the black opposition erupted into a full-scale civil war in which more than 30,000 people died. When Mr. Mugabe was released in 1974 in one of several abortive peace efforts, he joined his comrades in the bush. A self-declared Marxist, Mr. Mugabe was considered a shy, somewhat bookish intellectual, in marked contrast with his hardened comrades.

Like many liberation movements, Mr. Mugabe’s was a hothouse of suspicion and betrayal. Many members died under mysterious circumstances — sometimes at the hands of white assassins, other times by the long knives of their comrades. As leader, Mr. Mugabe rode the back of a tiger; had he ever fallen off, he too, in all likelihood, would have been devoured.

One year after Mugabe’s historic ouster, Zimbabwe looks much the same

He developed a sharp contempt for the British government, which was unable to bring Smith’s regime to heel; for the Soviet Union, which backed his rival, Nkomo, during the liberation struggle; and for the West in general, whose sanctions campaign against Rhodesia was halfhearted and ineffective.

Smith’s putative allies in South Africa, fearing that the conflict was destabilizing the region, finally forced his government into peace talks. Mr. Mugabe emerged from exile and won a decisive majority in the country’s first free election in 1980, the year the country became known as Zimbabwe.

He came to power — as prime minister and, starting in 1987, as president — initially pledging to bury old animosities.

“If yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds you to me and me to you,” he solemnly told his countrymen April 18, 1980. Still, even in those early days, he warned that “the open hand of reconciliation, if rejected, could turn into a clenched fist.”

Devolution of a nation

Paranoia was one legacy of the war. Mr. Mugabe, as elected leader, characterized political opponents as “enemies,” freely used detention without trial and other emergency powers that he inherited from the white regime, and intimidated opponents in his drive for a one-party state.

Each year, he sent several thousand soldiers — spearheaded by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade — into southwestern Matabeleland, Nkomo’s ethnic and political stronghold, ostensibly to root out armed dissidents. The main victims of these campaigns, which killed several thousand people, were minority Ndebeles.

Nkomo eventually submitted, folding his party into Mr. Mugabe’s ruling organization in return for an end to the brutal attacks against his followers.

Mr. Mugabe struggled at times to placate various blocs within his power base, the country’s Shona-speaking majority. Divisions within these blocs were geographic and tribal as well as ideological. Mr. Mugabe worked to hold together a consensus in part through dispensing jobs and patronage to his allies and targeting common enemies, real and imagined.

He singled out Zimbabwe’s small gay community, among other groups, denouncing LGBT individuals as “lower than dogs and pigs” and ordering the expulsion of a gay organization from the Zimbabwe International Book Fair in 1995. He claimed that homosexuality had been unknown in Africa before European colonization and blamed it for the AIDS crisis, when in fact heterosexual activity was the main cause of AIDS in Africa.

After his first wife, the former Sally Hayfron, died in 1992, Mr. Mugabe married his secretary and longtime mistress, Grace Marufu, 41 years his junior. She set a new standard for conspicuous consumption, acquiring the derogatory nickname “Gucci Grace” and shattering his reputation for personal honesty. More than one flight of the state-owned Air Zimbabwe was canceled at the last minute so that she and her entourage could fly to Europe for a shopping spree.

Mr. Mugabe had three children with Marufu. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

Although much of black-ruled Africa suffered bankruptcy and famine, Zimbabwe retained a modest measure of prosperity. Zimbabwe’s farmers not only fed the country’s own rapidly expanding population — now more than 16 million — but exported corn and other food to its hungry neighbors. Mr. Mugabe’s government instituted health and education programs that lowered the infant mortality rate and increased the number of high school and university graduates.

Zimbabwe’s uneasy stability began to crumble in the late 1990s as inflation, unemployment and the AIDS epidemic ate away at the country’s social and economic gains. Faced with rising discontent, Mr. Mugabe targeted one of the country’s most visible minority groups: the 4,500 white commercial farmers.

Mr. Mugabe dispatched thousands of unemployed war veterans and street thugs to harass the owners and seize their property. The government instituted a “land reform” policy that turned over the most successful farms to the political elite.

Productivity plummeted — production of corn, Zimbabwe’s main staple, fell by two-thirds — and the country swung from being a net food exporter to a basket case within a few years. Nearly 1 million black farmworkers and their families lost their jobs and homes, according to a 2008 study by Zimbabwean economists for the U.N. Development Program.

Mr. Mugabe’s unbroken string of electoral success ended in February 2000, when voters rejected a draft constitution that would have legitimized his vastly increased power. Four months later, a new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, won 57 of the 120 elected seats in parliament, capturing urban centers throughout the country and falling just short of a majority.

The government responded with a wave of repression, rounding up opposition leaders and attacking urban demonstrators, while in the countryside armed gangs destroyed the homes and food supplies of opponents.

Mr. Mugabe branded his foes as traitors and saboteurs, shut down independent media outlets and undermined the country’s independent judiciary. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was beaten, arrested and charged with plotting to kill Mr. Mugabe — only later to be acquitted.

Zimbabwe’s economic and political misery deepened. Basic public services such as water and sanitation, public schools and hospitals collapsed, and by 2008 the rate of inflation exceeded 10 million percent. Even many of Mr. Mugabe’s former allies called on him to step down. He was outpolled by Tsvangirai in the 2008 presidential election but refused to cede power.

Mr. Mugabe won a sixth term as president after Tsvangirai dropped out of the runoff contest because of threats against his life. But conditions continued to deteriorate so rapidly that Mr. Mugabe was finally forced to accept a power-sharing arrangement with his rival. The aging president retained full control of the security forces and other instruments of state repression.

A last straw

As his megalomania and isolation grew, Mr. Mugabe’s rhetoric became more extravagant and bizarre. He accused “gay gangsters” in British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government of fomenting political violence. He compared Blair and President George W. Bush to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and accused them of waging “a relentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my country.”

The economy plummeted so far that Mr. Mugabe was forced to accept some reforms. Inflation stabilized, average annual growth rates rebounded, and the European Union lifted its 12-year-old sanctions while maintaining a travel ban on Robert and Grace Mugabe. Tsvangirai’s opposition party splintered, paving the way for Mr. Mugabe’s landslide electoral victory in 2013 and an end of power sharing.

Zimbabwe’s international isolation continued. In 2014, President Barack Obama excluded him and Sudanese leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir — the latter pursued by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges — from a 2014 summit in Washington of 50 African leaders. Nonetheless, many Africans applauded Mr. Mugabe’s defiance and viewed him as a champion in the struggle against neocolonialism, and the next year, Mr. Mugabe began his one-year ceremonial role as chairman of the African Union, a body representing many of the continent’s governments.

Back in sole control, Mr. Mugabe sought to clear out potential rivals to Grace Mugabe succeeding him as leader of Zimbabwe. He ousted two successive vice presidents, including Mnangagwa in early November 2017, while naming his wife as head of ZANU-PF’s influential women’s league.

Grace Mugabe’s unstable behavior had increasingly alienated her from party elders. In the summer of 2017, a 20-year-old South African model accused her of beating her with an electrical cord. Grace Mugabe escaped prosecution in South Africa by invoking diplomatic immunity.

For the generals and security establishment, Mnangagwa’s ouster — a government spokesman accused him of “disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability” — appeared to be the last straw. A week later, the army made its move, confining Mugabe to his home in the northern Harare suburbs.

Even while seeking to orchestrate the struggle for succession, Mr. Mugabe had been in steep physical decline for several years. Cameras caught him stumbling down the steps of a dais in February 2015, while later that year he read to parliament the State of the Nation address he had given to the same chamber a few weeks earlier.

But he clung tenaciously to power even after his ouster from leadership. On the same day the ruling committee of ZANU-PF voted for his dismissal, he gave a rambling and disjointed television address to the nation in which he conceded that changes were needed but initially refused to announce his resignation, prolonging the leadership crisis. He announced his resignation after lawmakers began impeachment proceedings against him.

Proud, obstinate and self-righteous to the end, Mr. Mugabe never accepted responsibility for the damage he caused his country. For all his intelligence and cunning, critics said, he never made the jump from running a liberation movement to governing a nation. Instead, he turned one of Africa’s most promising national experiments into one of its most embarrassing failures.

Mr. Mugabe worked to hold together a consensus in part through dispensing jobs and patronage to his allies and targeting common enemies, real and imagined.\n\nHe singled out Zimbabwe’s small gay community, among other groups, denouncing LGBT individuals as “lower than dogs and pigs” and ordering the expulsion of a gay organization from the Zimbabwe International Book Fair in 1995. He claimed that homosexuality had been unknown in Africa before European colonization and blamed it for the AIDS crisis, when in fact heterosexual activity was the main cause of AIDS in Africa.\n\nAfter his first wife, the former Sally Hayfron, died in 1992, Mr. Mugabe married his secretary and longtime mistress, Grace Marufu, 41 years his junior. She set a new standard for conspicuous consumption, acquiring the derogatory nickname “Gucci Grace” and shattering his reputation for personal honesty. More than one flight of the state-owned Air Zimbabwe was canceled at the last minute so that she and her entourage could fly to Europe for a shopping spree.\n\nMr. Mugabe had three children with Marufu. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nAlthough much of black-ruled Africa suffered bankruptcy and famine, Zimbabwe retained a modest measure of prosperity. Zimbabwe’s farmers not only fed the country’s own rapidly expanding population — now more than 16 million — but exported corn and other food to its hungry neighbors. Mr. Mugabe’s government instituted health and education programs that lowered the infant mortality rate and increased the number of high school and university graduates.\n\nZimbabwe’s uneasy stability began to crumble in the late 1990s as inflation, unemployment and the AIDS epidemic ate away at the country’s social and economic gains. Faced with rising discontent, Mr. Mugabe targeted one of the country’s most visible minority groups: the 4,500 white commercial farmers.\n\nMr. Mugabe dispatched thousands of unemployed war veterans and street thugs to harass the owners and seize their property. The government instituted a “land reform” policy that turned over the most successful farms to the political elite.\n\nProductivity plummeted — production of corn, Zimbabwe’s main staple, fell by two-thirds — and the country swung from being a net food exporter to a basket case within a few years. Nearly 1 million black farmworkers and their families lost their jobs and homes, according to a 2008 study by Zimbabwean economists for the U.N. Development Program.\n\nMr. Mugabe’s unbroken string of electoral success ended in February 2000, when voters rejected a draft constitution that would have legitimized his vastly increased power. Four months later, a new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, won 57 of the 120 elected seats in parliament, capturing urban centers throughout the country and falling just short of a majority.\n\nThe government responded with a wave of repression, rounding up opposition leaders and attacking urban demonstrators, while in the countryside armed gangs destroyed the homes and food supplies of opponents.\n\nMr. Mugabe branded his foes as traitors and saboteurs, shut down independent media outlets and undermined the country’s independent judiciary. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was beaten, arrested and charged with plotting to kill Mr. Mugabe — only later to be acquitted.\n\nZimbabwe’s economic and political misery deepened. Basic public services such as water and sanitation, public schools and hospitals collapsed, and by 2008 the rate of inflation exceeded 10 million percent. Even many of Mr. Mugabe’s former allies called on him to step down. He was outpolled by Tsvangirai in the 2008 presidential election but refused to cede power.\n\nMr. Mugabe won a sixth term as president after Tsvangirai dropped out of the runoff contest because of threats against his life. But conditions continued to deteriorate so rapidly that Mr. Mugabe was finally forced to accept a power-sharing arrangement with his rival. The aging president retained full control of the security forces and other instruments of state repression.\n\nA last straw\n\nAs his megalomania and isolation grew, Mr. Mugabe’s rhetoric became more extravagant and bizarre. He accused “gay gangsters” in British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government of fomenting political violence. He compared Blair and President George W. Bush to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and accused them of waging “a relentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my country.”\n\nThe economy plummeted so far that Mr. Mugabe was forced to accept some reforms. Inflation stabilized, average annual growth rates rebounded, and the European Union lifted its 12-year-old sanctions while maintaining a travel ban on Robert and Grace Mugabe. Tsvangirai’s opposition party splintered, paving the way for Mr. Mugabe’s landslide electoral victory in 2013 and an end of power sharing.\n\nZimbabwe’s international isolation continued. In 2014, President Barack Obama excluded him and Sudanese leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir — the latter pursued by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges — from a 2014 summit in Washington of 50 African leaders. Nonetheless, many Africans applauded Mr. Mugabe’s defiance and viewed him as a champion in the struggle against neocolonialism, and the next year, Mr. Mugabe began his one-year ceremonial role as chairman of the African Union, a body representing many of the continent’s governments.\n\nBack in sole control, Mr. Mugabe sought to clear out potential rivals to Grace Mugabe succeeding him as leader of Zimbabwe. He ousted two successive vice presidents, including Mnangagwa in early November 2017, while naming his wife as head of ZANU-PF’s influential women’s league.\n\nGrace Mugabe’s unstable behavior had increasingly alienated her from party elders. In the summer of 2017, a 20-year-old South African model accused her of beating her with an electrical cord. Grace Mugabe escaped prosecution in South Africa by invoking diplomatic immunity.\n\nFor the generals and security establishment, Mnangagwa’s ouster — a government spokesman accused him of “disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability” — appeared to be the last straw. A week later, the army made its move, confining Mugabe to his home in the northern Harare suburbs.\n\nEven while seeking to orchestrate the struggle for succession, Mr. Mugabe had been in steep physical decline for several years. Cameras caught him stumbling down the steps of a dais in February 2015, while later that year he read to parliament the State of the Nation address he had given to the same chamber a few weeks earlier.\n\nBut he clung tenaciously to power even after his ouster from leadership. On the same day the ruling committee of ZANU-PF voted for his dismissal, he gave a rambling and disjointed television address to the nation in which he conceded that changes were needed but initially refused to announce his resignation, prolonging the leadership crisis. He announced his resignation after lawmakers began impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nProud, obstinate and self-righteous to the end, Mr. Mugabe never accepted responsibility for the damage he caused his country. For all his intelligence and cunning, critics said, he never made the jump from running a liberation movement to governing a nation. Instead, he turned one of Africa’s most promising national experiments into one of its most embarrassing failures.\n\nFrankel was The Washington Post’s southern Africa bureau chief, based in Harare.', 'authorsList': ['Glenn Frankel'], 'description': 'The champion of the black liberation struggle in Africa rose to political power, then let his nation fall into ruin over a 37-year iron-fisted rule.', 'probability': 0.98342746, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/robert-mugabe-zimbabwean-leader-who-helped-liberate-and-destroy-his-country-dies-at-95/2019/09/06/165c0f62-d06a-11e9-87fa-8501a456c003_story.html', 'dateModified': '2019-09-06T11:37:00+00:00', 'datePublished': '2019-09-06T05:53:49+00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class=""article-body""><div class=""teaser-content""><section><div><p class=""font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "">Robert Mugabe, the Zimbab\xadwean president who rose to power as a champion of anti-colonial struggle but during 37 years of authoritarian rule presided over the impoverishment and degradation of one of sub-Saharan Africa’s most promising countries, died Sept.\xa06 at a hospital in Singapore.

Sebastien	Rex Tillerson	individual	https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/rex-tillerson-shares-exxons-tax-transparency-problems/	"Donald Trump didn’t provide his tax returns before he was elected either, unlike every other presidential candidate in recent history. They appear to believe that the usual rules don’t apply to them. This raises fundamental questions over their suitability for the highest positions in our country, and it also makes one wonder what they have to hide. As Tillerson prepares for the Senate to review his ability to serve, these questions are more relevant than ever.

Tillerson’s refusal to open up to public scrutiny is consistent with Exxon’s track record of secrecy. In addition to facing allegations that it misled the public over the science behind climate change, the company refuses to open up about its US taxes.

Defenders of Trump and Tillerson argue there are valid privacy concerns behind holding back their tax information. Privacy is important, as enshrined in US law - but it has to be balanced against the public good. As candidates for high public office, Trump and Tillerson’s right to privacy is far outweighed by the need for the public to know that they have paid their dues to society. As President Nixon said, “people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook” – the same applies to their top diplomat. To eliminate any doubt, Tillerson should release his returns to the Senate, just as dozens of Republican and Democrat nominees have done before him.

This raises questions about one of the pillars of the Trump victory. When he speaks about “draining the swamp” it’s easy to imagine a massive cull of political elites corrupted by financial interests. What’s happening now is very different. In casting itself as a team of political outsiders, the Trump campaign has managed to shield itself from accountability and protect its business interests. They are merging the worlds of big business and its regulators, without recognition of the impact this will have on the people they are there to serve. The heads of big business, with secretive financial dealings and no public service record whatsoever, are moving into our nation’s highest seats of power, and disregarding norms designed to hold them to account.

Exxon’s track record under Tillerson on transparency is dire. The natural resource sector is famously corrupt – the world’s most corrupt industry according to the OECD. But Exxon and other oil companies can no longer hide behind the excuse of confidentiality. Increasingly, companies are expected to disclose what they pay in taxes and other payments to governments of countries whose natural resources they extract. This is now required under laws of the US and 30 other countries, as well as international initiatives. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard which aims to put information about government revenues from natural resource deals into the public domain in 51 countries including the United States. This includes the taxes these companies pay, which is key to ensuring citizens know what benefits they get from their natural resources.

An ongoing anti-corruption probe involving Exxon in Nigeria highlights the need for strong transparency rules. Authorities in Nigeria are investigating how Exxon reportedly paid $600 million to renew three oil licenses that may have been valued by the Nigerian government at $2.55 billion, according to documents seen by Global Witness. Improved payment transparency will shed light on and deter these types of questionable deals.

Exxon publicly supports these transparency efforts: it has long maintained a seat on the EITI’s international board, and also has a representative on the domestic US EITI governing body. In reality, however, Exxon has mastered the art of paying lip service to transparency while doing all it can to undermine these efforts behind the scenes. Exxon is refusing to publish its US tax payments, in contrast to some of its competitors such as BP and Shell. And like Trump, Exxon is not just side-stepping the rules – it is actively trying to bring them down. Mr. Tillerson served as a chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful oil lobby group that has fought against a Congressionally-mandated regulation to disclose natural resource payments.

It is now the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations’ job to decide whether Tillerson is the right person for such an important appointment. With his and Exxon’s track record of keeping critical information away from scrutiny and actively undermining attempts to fight corruption, they must consider if he is really fit to serve the American people."

Sebastien	SHIRI Perence	individual	https://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/zimbabwe/who-is-perrance-shiri-black-jesus-dead-29-july-2020/	"Zimbabweans have woken up to news that Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri has died and while President Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the passing in a moving tribute to his colleague, it was the unsavoury reactions to Shiri’s death which stood out.

Prior to joining government in 2017, Shiri had served in the Zimbabwe Air Force for 25 years and is also the cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, whom he helped remove out of office after 30 years at the helm.

“Good Riddance”, said one social media user.

He died in the early hours of Wednesday, 29 July 2020, however many have been less than pleasant in their responses to his passing – citing his role in the army massacres, known as ‘Gukurahundi’.

Perrance Shiri and the dark history of Gukurahundi

As many as 30 000 people were killed between 1983 and 1987, by a brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) – as part of a crackdown on dissidents in Matabeleland North Province, a homeland of the Ndebele.

Thousands of Ndebele were detained by government forces and either marched to re-education camps or brutally executed.

Shiri was also reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans in the late 1990s and has been accused by Zimbabwean opposition politicians of overseeing military assaults on illegal mineworkers in diamond mines east of the country.

‘Black Jesus’

Shiri infamously referred to himself as ‘Black Jesus’, reportedly because he “could determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or not”, said an anonymous source to the BBC.

“I am deeply saddened to inform the Nation of the death of the Minister of Agriculture, Air Chief Marshall (rtd) Perrance Shiri, a long time friend and colleague. Cde Shiri was a true patriot, who devoted his life to the liberation, independence and service of his country”, Mnangagwa said in a statement.

Shiri’s deputy Vangelis Haritatos, also paid tribute to him and said he was an extremely hard worker and was dedicated to serving his nation.

However Zimbabwe’s former Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo said it was sad that victims of the massacre couldn’t receive justice.

“It’s tragic that Perence Shiri has departed without facing justice over the gukurahundi atrocities he committed in Matabeleland & Midlands provinces in the 1980s; nor telling the truth about those atrocities to help heal the nation. May God rest Shiri’s victims in eternal peace”, he said.

Ousting Mugabe

Shiri was part of the Zimbabwean Defence Forces which surrounded the home of then President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 and subsequently demanded his resignation. The army hasmaintained that his ousting was not a result of a military coup, however analysts have disputed this, citing the nature of the transition of power to Mnangagwa. Shiri subsequently took up a cabinet post under the new administration."

Shakshi	Bahawal KHAN	Individual	http://www.destinations.com.pk/rising-sand-story-bahawalpur/	"Travel writer and historian Salman Rashid narrates a fascinating account of the history of Bahawalpur, from the times of the Rajput prince in the 10th century who laid the foundations of the mighty Derawar Fort in the Cholistan Desert to the reign of the descendants of the Abbasid caliphate who became the founders of this vastly affluent state.

The river Jamuna was home to a fearsome dragon in an age long ago. For some reason the gods became displeased with it and ordered it to leave the river and seek a new home in the vast oceans. But because the dragon could only travel through water, the gods were benevolent enough to order the Jamuna to send a stream southward all the way to the sea.

The dragon left the river by this new stream that was for millennia known as the Hakra. But the long and creative passage of time leaves nothing, not even the work of gods, unaltered. The Hakra that was once the dragon’s passage and which slaked a huge country turning it green with farmland and orchard dried up. The land turned desert and today the only sign of the lost river is a meandering depression through the dunes of the Cholistan Desert.

Here, amid the dunes-hardy desert, Rajputs continued to worship Dharti Mata, the Earth Goddess, whose echoes we still hear at the festival of Channan Pir near Yazman. And here the crafty prince Rawal Deo Raj carved out a kingdom for himself. Given a cowhide by his father-in-law and told to build his territory on an area that could be covered by it and no more, the astute prince did not have to think long. Cutting the hide into thin strips, he compassed a large area that his father-in-law could not deny him.

On that he raised his mud-brick fort calling it Dera (home) Rawal Deo Raj after himself. That was in the middle years of the 10th century. Over time it came to be known as Derarawal or Derawar and as its hoariness grew, legends accreted to it. Among others, it was believed to be the repository of a vast treasure left behind by Alexander the Macedonian as he passed on southward through this territory.

Drawn by these stories, Shah Hasan Arghun, then ruling over Sindh, raided Derawar in 1525. His history refers to the fort as Dilawar and we are told that after a short siege, he defeated the Langah chieftain and removed a large treasure from the fort.

The truth sprinkled across the dunes of modern Bahawalpur district in the form of cultural mounds is that the Hakra did indeed flow and nurture an ancient civilisation whose cities easily rivalled the better-known Moen jo Daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley. The truth also is that some four thousand years ago, the Hakra ran dry. The inhabitants of its rich cities moved away and the sand moved in to smother their homes. While the Indus Valley received the archaeologists’ fullest attention, the lost Hakra remained a poor cousin and was only cursorily investigated so that we do not know what surprises still sleep beneath the Cholistan dunes.

This silence, broken periodically, prevailed for centuries until far away in the south a squabble broke out between brothers. Amir Channi Khan, holding sway in upper Sindh, had on his deathbed passed on his turban, the symbol of government, to his elder son Mehdi. To the younger Daud he bequeathed his copy of the Quran and his rosary to take on the role of spiritual guide. Some years later when Mehdi died, Daud Khan attempted to deprive Mehdi’s son, his own nephew, Kalhora of the turban. Bitter strife ensued until Daud abandoned his claim to the throne and migrated north to stake out another area.

Known as the Daudpotra (sons of Daud), surnamed Abbasis for they claimed descent from the Abbasid caliphate, this man’s progeny became the founders of a state that was so affluent in the 20th century that besides doing great public works in its own domain it also financially supported the municipal uplift of Mecca. The first Abbasi to come into prominence was Sadiq Mohammad Khan I in the 1730s. He was an administrator who subdued local brigands to bring peace and order and built towns in the country today known as Rahim Yar Khan and Bahawalpur.

Seeing his ability, the Persian invader Nadir Shah placed him in charge of the important towns of upper Sindh together with the ancient fort of Derawar. This latter place, Sadiq Mohammad had only a few years earlier wrested from the Rajput prince Rawal Akhi Singh. But Sadiq Mohammad’s days were numbered.

As soon as Nadir Shah had withdrawn to the west, Sadiq’s kinsman Khudayar Kalhora attacked him in his Shikarpur stronghold. A hard fought battle resulted in the death of Sadiq and his turban passing to his eldest son Bahawal Khan I. Realising that he did not possess the wherewithal to hold a country extending as far south as Shikarpur and Larkana, Bahawal Khan turned his attention to a spot way off in the north.

In the sandy wilderness, a few kilometres from the banks of the Sutlej River, stood the solitary mansion of a local zamindar. Raising a fortified wall around it and establishing a town within, Bahawal Khan called it Bahawalpur after himself. So that verdure may replace desert aridity, he ordered a canal to convey water from the Sutlej and along its serpentine course he planted gardens. The year was 1748.

Sixty years later, in 1808, the peripatetic statesman and writer Mountstuart Elphinstone came to Bahawalpur. The walls enclosed a town of about ‘4 miles in circumference’ where mango orchards grew amid tightly packed houses. He found the streets crowded with townsfolk who had a language distinct from that of central India and a particular mode of dress. The man also noted that industry thrived and cotton lungis and silk girdles and turbans were the major manufacture of Bahawalpur.

Fast forward to 1827 and we have Charles Masson, the scholarly deserter from the East India Company army travelling about under a pseudonym to escape arrest and court-martial. He was delighted to reach Bahawalpur after the long journey through sandy wastes to find himself ‘in a large populous city, surrounded with luxuriantly cultivated fields, and groves of stately palm-trees.’

Bahawal Khan’s canal that he called Khanwah and which was commonly known as Nagini – serpentine – because of its meandering course had worked wonders for the city: Masson found it a place of ‘fertility and abundance.’ The wall was gone however, for the ex-soldier noticed but traces of it.

Time passed and one thing that stood out was that the Abbasi rulers of Bahawalpur treated their fiefdom with great concern and an eye for progress. By the end of the 19th century, the town was a bustling mart with a brisk trade in cotton, indigo, oil seeds, dates, mango, livestock, carpets and leather products. Travellers of a hundred years ago noticed narrow bazaars roofed with matting to keep the heat out and thronging with buyers and sellers engaged in animated trade. By every measure, Bahawalpur was a success story.

This progress is remarkable in view of the disturbances of the 1860s during the reign of Nawab Bahawal Khan IV (reigned 1858-1866). The Nawab’s own kinsmen, colluding with some Baloch chieftains, planned to replace him with an uncle of his. On 27 March 1866, the Nawab was served a poisoned meal and before the night was over, he had given up his ghost.

His son, Sadiq, not yet five years of age, was named the next Nawab. It was a time of great uncertainty as his dowager mother fended off the intrigues of courtiers and pretenders to the throne. At eighteen he received the turban and became the ruler of Bahawalpur as Sadiq Mohammad Khan Abbasi IV. He was a man cultivated and possessed of fine taste. In the annals of Bahawalpur, he can easily be celebrated as the finest builder who set the tone of the building tradition among his successors.

In 1874, Sadiq Abbasi ordered the fabulous Noor Mahal to serve as his private residence. When it was completed the following year, his treasury was the poorer by Rs. 1.2 million, but the city of Bahawalpur had gained a jewel that it can still be proud of. With its domes, pillared verandas and pediments, it is a masterpiece of Italian architecture in our part of the subcontinent.

But even before he could move in, the Nawab realised the palace’s proximity to a graveyard. Rather than hear the wailings of the bereaved come to bury their departed, he gave up the idea of residing in it. It was, however, all right for visitors to be troubled by the breast beating for His Highness re-designated his palace as a guest house and office.

For his own use he raised an even more fabulous retreat. Sadiq Garh Palace in the palm-saturated setting of Ahmedpur (aka Dera Nawab), 50 kilometres southwest of Bahawalpur, became the new pride of place. Nawab sahib was clearly taken by Italian architectural vocabulary. But this time, his appreciation of the Indian was wedded to the European.

Completed in 1895, in no fewer than thirteen years of painstaking intricate work, Sadiq Garh Palace became a very mixed extravagance of two styles. Here is a fantasy of Italian domes, bay windows with Mughal domelets, mock arches juxtaposed with pediments, and pillars with Doric capitals and the overflowing pot of Laxmi at the base. The Nawab’s fancy was duly matched by the skill of his architect.

This was a time when the Nawab maintained three capitals. Bahawalpur where he would entertain visiting dignitaries; Dera Nawab as an informal capital for private and state business and also his family’s residence. And across the dunes in the desert Derawar Fort, its clay ramparts now lined with fired bricks, the place for the traditional dustaar-bundi – the formal donning of the turban of kingship. As well as that, Derawar was the royal burial place. Even today, the stately domes of its many mausoleums, dusty and somewhat the worse for neglect, not far from the royal mosque recall a past grandeur.

Alas, Sadiq Mohammad IV could only enjoy the pleasures of this palace for four years. He died in 1899 leaving his building tradition and his fiefdom to his son Bahawal Khan Abbasi V. The young prince inherited the fine taste of his father honed by a first-rate education at Lahore’s Aitchison College and private tuition from a very able teacher. He not only followed his father’s building tradition, he redoubled its speed and accomplishment.

His reign saw a stupendous blossoming of new buildings. Darbar Mahal, foremost among the new additions, is a Mughal extravaganza. Sadly, this Nawab’s life was almost a replay of his father’s: Bahawal Khan too died early (in 1907) and left behind an infant son to be overseen by a Council of Regency. Even before Sadiq Mohammad Khan V wore the turban of chieftainship, he began to make his mark by continuing his father’s and grandsire’s superior building tradition.

However, where his forebears built palaces, this remarkable and civic-minded ruler with his eye on educational development in his kingdom raised the Bahawalpur Library in the 1930s and Sadiq Public School in the early 1950s. While the library created a reading public, the school, functioning to this day, has produced some very fine women and men to lead in various fields.

Long before oil enriched the Saudi kingdom, Nawab Sadiq Mohammad V was shoring up the impoverished kingdom with lavish handouts. Later, though he ceded his kingdom to Pakistan with some hesitation, he was liberal with his financial assistance to the new struggling country. In his largesse, he gifted his private properties to King Edward Medical College and the Punjab University, besides a large tract of prime real estate to the Punjab government.

In 1955, Sadiq Mohammad ceded the independent State of Bahawalpur to Punjab province. Eleven years later this able and far-sighted ruler passed away leaving his erstwhile to a progeny that was nowhere near his visionary leadership.

The priceless built heritage of Bahawalpur fell into neglect. Invaluable pieces of fittings and decoration were pilfered by none other than the children of the late Nawab, the very inheritors of it all, who squabbled over possession of the various properties especially the exquisite Sadiq Garh Palace.

The abandoned palaces of Bahawalpur city may well have crumbled to dust had they not been taken over by the army in the late 1980s. Not all was lost!

Today Sadiq Garh Palace, the jewel of Bahawalpur’s crown, stands forlorn and wretched, its beautiful fittings plundered, its gardens unkempt and its rooms bereft of every adornment. It is a sad testament to the greatness of three of the finest rulers of a bygone dynasty that turned Bahawalpur from sand desert to a very orchard."

For some reason the gods became displeased with it and ordered it to leave the river and seek a new home in the vast oceans. But because the dragon could only travel through water, the gods were benevolent enough to order the Jamuna to send a stream southward all the way to the sea.\n\nThe dragon left the river by this new stream that was for millennia known as the Hakra. But the long and creative passage of time leaves nothing, not even the work of gods, unaltered. The Hakra that was once the dragon’s passage and which slaked a huge country turning it green with farmland and orchard dried up. The land turned desert and today the only sign of the lost river is a meandering depression through the dunes of the Cholistan Desert.\n\nHere, amid the dunes-hardy desert, Rajputs continued to worship Dharti Mata, the Earth Goddess, whose echoes we still hear at the festival of Channan Pir near Yazman. And here the crafty prince Rawal Deo Raj carved out a kingdom for himself. Given a cowhide by his father-in-law and told to build his territory on an area that could be covered by it and no more, the astute prince did not have to think long. Cutting the hide into thin strips, he compassed a large area that his father-in-law could not deny him.\n\nOn that he raised his mud-brick fort calling it Dera (home) Rawal Deo Raj after himself. That was in the middle years of the 10th century. Over time it came to be known as Derarawal or Derawar and as its hoariness grew, legends accreted to it. Among others, it was believed to be the repository of a vast treasure left behind by Alexander the Macedonian as he passed on southward through this territory.\n\nDrawn by these stories, Shah Hasan Arghun, then ruling over Sindh, raided Derawar in 1525. His history refers to the fort as Dilawar and we are told that after a short siege, he defeated the Langah chieftain and removed a large treasure from the fort.\n\nThe truth sprinkled across the dunes of modern Bahawalpur district in the form of cultural mounds is that the Hakra did indeed flow and nurture an ancient civilisation whose cities easily rivalled the better-known Moen jo Daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley. The truth also is that some four thousand years ago, the Hakra ran dry. The inhabitants of its rich cities moved away and the sand moved in to smother their homes. While the Indus Valley received the archaeologists’ fullest attention, the lost Hakra remained a poor cousin and was only cursorily investigated so that we do not know what surprises still sleep beneath the Cholistan dunes.\n\nThis silence, broken periodically, prevailed for centuries until far away in the south a squabble broke out between brothers. Amir Channi Khan, holding sway in upper Sindh, had on his deathbed passed on his turban, the symbol of government, to his elder son Mehdi. To the younger Daud he bequeathed his copy of the Quran and his rosary to take on the role of spiritual guide. Some years later when Mehdi died, Daud Khan attempted to deprive Mehdi’s son, his own nephew, Kalhora of the turban. Bitter strife ensued until Daud abandoned his claim to the throne and migrated north to stake out another area.\n\nKnown as the Daudpotra (sons of Daud), surnamed Abbasis for they claimed descent from the Abbasid caliphate, this man’s progeny became the founders of a state that was so affluent in the 20th century that besides doing great public works in its own domain it also financially supported the municipal uplift of Mecca.

For some reason the gods became displeased with it and ordered it to leave the river and seek a new home in the vast oceans. But because the dragon could only travel through water, the gods were benevolent enough to order the Jamuna to send a stream southward all the way to the sea.</p>\n\n<p>The dragon left the river by this new stream that was for millennia known as the Hakra. But the long and creative passage of time leaves nothing, not even the work of gods, unaltered. The Hakra that was once the dragon’s passage and which slaked a huge country turning it green with farmland and orchard dried up. The land turned desert and today the only sign of the lost river is a meandering depression through the dunes of the Cholistan Desert.</p>\n\n<p>Here, amid the dunes-hardy desert, Rajputs continued to worship Dharti Mata, the Earth Goddess, whose echoes we still hear at the festival of Channan Pir near Yazman. And here the crafty prince Rawal Deo Raj carved out a kingdom for himself. Given a cowhide by his father-in-law and told to build his territory on an area that could be covered by it and no more, the astute prince did not have to think long. Cutting the hide into thin strips, he compassed a large area that his father-in-law could not deny him.</p>\n\n<p>On that he raised his mud-brick fort calling it Dera (home) Rawal Deo Raj after himself. That was in the middle years of the 10th century. Over time it came to be known as Derarawal or Derawar and as its hoariness grew, legends accreted to it. Among others, it was believed to be the repository of a vast treasure left behind by Alexander the Macedonian as he passed on southward through this territory.</p>\n\n<p>Drawn by these stories, Shah Hasan Arghun, then ruling over Sindh, raided Derawar in 1525. His history refers to the fort as Dilawar and we are told that after a short siege, he defeated the Langah chieftain and removed a large treasure from the fort.</p>\n\n<p>The truth sprinkled across the dunes of modern Bahawalpur district in the form of cultural mounds is that the Hakra did indeed flow and nurture an ancient civilisation whose cities easily rivalled the better-known Moen jo Daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley. The truth also is that some four thousand years ago, the Hakra ran dry. The inhabitants of its rich cities moved away and the sand moved in to smother their homes. While the Indus Valley received the archaeologists’ fullest attention, the lost Hakra remained a poor cousin and was only cursorily investigated so that we do not know what surprises still sleep beneath the Cholistan dunes.</p>\n\n<p>This silence, broken periodically, prevailed for centuries until far away in the south a squabble broke out between brothers. Amir Channi Khan, holding sway in upper Sindh, had on his deathbed passed on his turban, the symbol of government, to his elder son Mehdi. To the younger Daud he bequeathed his copy of the Quran and his rosary to take on the role of spiritual guide. Some years later when Mehdi died, Daud Khan attempted to deprive Mehdi’s son, his own nephew, Kalhora of the turban. Bitter strife ensued until Daud abandoned his claim to the throne and migrated north to stake out another area.</p>\n\n<p>Known as the Daudpotra (sons of Daud), surnamed Abbasis for they claimed descent from the Abbasid caliphate, this man’s progeny became the founders of a state that was so affluent in the 20th century that besides doing great public works in its own domain it also financially supported the municipal uplift of Mecca. The first Abbasi to come into prominence was Sadiq Mohammad Khan I in the 1730s. He was an administrator who subdued local brigands to bring peace and order and built towns in the country today known as Rahim Yar Khan and Bahawalpur.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing his ability, the Persian invader Nadir Shah placed him in charge of the important towns of upper Sindh together with the ancient fort of Derawar. This latter place, Sadiq Mohammad had only a few years earlier wrested from the Rajput prince Rawal Akhi Singh. But Sadiq Mohammad’s days were numbered.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as Nadir Shah had withdrawn to the west, Sadiq’s kinsman Khudayar Kalhora attacked him in his Shikarpur stronghold. A hard fought battle resulted in the death of Sadiq and his turban passing to his eldest son Bahawal Khan I. Realising that he did not possess the wherewithal to hold a country extending as far south as Shikarpur and Larkana, Bahawal Khan turned his attention to a spot way off in the north.</p>\n\n<p>In the sandy wilderness, a few kilometres from the banks of the Sutlej River, stood the solitary mansion of a local zamindar. Raising a fortified wall around it and establishing a town within, Bahawal Khan called it Bahawalpur after himself. So that verdure may replace desert aridity, he ordered a canal to convey water from the Sutlej and along its serpentine course he planted gardens. The year was 1748.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty years later, in 1808, the peripatetic statesman and writer Mountstuart Elphinstone came to Bahawalpur. The walls enclosed a town of about ‘4 miles in circumference’ where mango orchards grew amid tightly packed houses. He found the streets crowded with townsfolk who had a language distinct from that of central India and a particular mode of dress. The man also noted that industry thrived and cotton lungis and silk girdles and turbans were the major manufacture of Bahawalpur.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to 1827 and we have Charles Masson, the scholarly deserter from the East India Company army travelling about under a pseudonym to escape arrest and court-martial. He was delighted to reach Bahawalpur after the long journey through sandy wastes to find himself ‘in a large populous city, surrounded with luxuriantly cultivated fields, and groves of stately palm-trees.’</p>\n\n<p>Bahawal Khan’s canal that he called Khanwah and which was commonly known as Nagini – serpentine – because of its meandering course had worked wonders for the city: Masson found it a place of ‘fertility and abundance.’ The wall was gone however, for the ex-soldier noticed but traces of it.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed and one thing that stood out was that the Abbasi rulers of Bahawalpur treated their fiefdom with great concern and an eye for progress. By the end of the 19th century, the town was a bustling mart with a brisk trade in cotton, indigo, oil seeds, dates, mango, livestock, carpets and leather products. Travellers of a hundred years ago noticed narrow bazaars roofed with matting to keep the heat out and thronging with buyers and sellers engaged in animated trade. By every measure, Bahawalpur was a success story.</p>\n\n<p>This progress is remarkable in view of the disturbances of the 1860s during the reign of Nawab Bahawal Khan IV (reigned 1858-1866). The Nawab’s own kinsmen, colluding with some Baloch chieftains, planned to replace him with an uncle of his. On 27 March 1866, the Nawab was served a poisoned meal and before the night was over, he had given up his ghost.</p>\n\n<p>His son, Sadiq, not yet five years of age, was named the next Nawab. It was a time of great uncertainty as his dowager mother fended off the intrigues of courtiers and pretenders to the throne. At eighteen he received the turban and became the ruler of Bahawalpur as Sadiq Mohammad Khan Abbasi IV. He was a man cultivated and possessed of fine taste. In the annals of Bahawalpur, he can easily be celebrated as the finest builder who set the tone of the building tradition among his successors.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=""https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b.jpg""><img src=""https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b-581x800.jpg"" alt="""" srcset=""https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b-581x800.jpg 581w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b-291x400.jpg 291w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b-768x1057.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.177/d97.04a.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sketch-nawab-4b.jpg 1800w"" sizes=""(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px""></a><figcaption>Nawab Muhammad Suba Sadiq Abbasi IV Ruled <br> 1866 – 1899</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>In 1874, Sadiq Abbasi ordered the fabulous Noor Mahal to serve as his private residence.

Wanting	TikTok	company	https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54715050	"Published

TikTok is continuing to expand despite coming under attack from the Trump administration in the US.

The Chinese-owned firm has announced a tie-up with online retailer Shopify to help businesses create video ads to promote their products.

TikTok also plans to take on around 3,000 engineers over the next three years, a spokesman told the BBC.

The popular short-form video app is being forced to sell its US operations to an American company or face a ban.

TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance will hire the engineers mostly in Europe, Canada, the US and Singapore ""to support our rapid global growth,"" it said.

It currently employs about 1,000 engineers outside of China, with nearly half of them based in California.

Last month, it emerged that ByteDance plans to invest billions of dollars and recruit hundreds of employees in Singapore, which has been selected as its South East Asia headquarters.

The Trump administration says Chinese-owned social media platforms such as TikTok and Tencent's WeChat pose a national security threat, claiming users' data can be accessed by the Chinese government.

Both companies have repeatedly denied these allegations.

Despite the US uncertainty, TikTok continues to push ahead with its hiring expansion plan and moves into e-commerce.

Video ads

On Tuesday, Canada-based Shopify said it was tying up with TikTok in the US to allow businesses to create and track video ads.

Shopify said the partnership allows its one million merchants to sell products in the form of ""shoppable video ads"".

TikTok users can click on the ad to buy the product via Shopify. The tie-up will be available first in the US, where the Chinese app has around 100 million users.

There are plans to roll out the global partnership across Europe and South East Asia early next year.

""We've seen that our community loves connecting with the brands they're passionate about,"" said a TikTok spokesman.

US ban

In August, Donald Trump signed executive orders against TikTok's parent company, but these have been challenged in US courts.

One of these orders forces ByteDance to sell its US operations by 12 November, one week after the presidential election, or face a ban.

A last-minute deal to sell TikTok's US business to Oracle and Walmart is currently being reviewed with question marks over what stakes the different firms will take.

In June, Walmart also partnered with Shopify to expand its online marketplace business and tap into the huge surge in online shopping during the virus pandemic.

A judge will consider on 4 November if the US government will be allowed to ban downloads of TikTok from US app stores."

The EU is weaponising money laundering and tax rules
Karl			https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/29/israeli-zeal-for-second-trump-term-matched-by-palestinian-enmity	"Anyone in any doubt about Benjamin Netanyahu’s preferred candidate in the US presidential election need only visit his personal Twitter account.

Right at the top, behind the headshot of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, is a banner photo of him with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, their eyes fixed on each other.

“You have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu told his ally during a Washington visit this year. “Frankly, though we’ve had some great, outstanding friends in these halls, it’s not even close.”

That list includes Barack Obama, whose famously icy relationship with Netanyahu extends by proxy to his vice-president and Trump’s 2020 rival, Joe Biden.

Palestinians see the prospect of a second Trump term as disastrous. “If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us, God help you and God help the whole world,” the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said this month.

Trump has arguably been the US president with most impact on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as he has sought to appeal to his pro-Israel base, including evangelical Christians. During the past four years, the US leader has ticked off much on Netanyahu’s hardline nationalist wishlist that was previously considered taboo.

He has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, declared the divided city of Jerusalem Israel’s capital, shut down Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington and devised a “peace plan” that affords Israel’s government the vast majority of its demands.

Led by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the Trump administration has also persuaded the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel despite the ongoing occupation. It has also imposed further sanctions on Iran, a policy Israel has been advocating against its arch-enemy for years.

“For Netanyahu personally, obviously he has a preference,” said Yohanan Plesner, a former Israeli politician and president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “One of the assets that Mr Netanyahu sells to the Israeli public is his close intimate relationship with Mr Trump.”

Four more years of Trump could be hugely advantageous for the Israeli leader, particularly if Washington can convince more Arab states to establish open ties with Israel with few or no concessions to the Palestinians.

A further softening of Washington’s stance on illegal settlements in Palestinian territories, or even recognising annexation moves, could also be on the table. Trump’s US ambassador to Israel and former bankruptcy lawyer, David Friedman, is vocal in his support for Jewish settlements.

Trump’s image and that of his country may have plummeted worldwide, but many Israelis adore him. According to a survey conducted for the i24News channel, 63% would prefer him to win the election, compared with less than 19% who would prefer Biden.

Plesner, however, says that does not mean Israelis are overly concerned about a Biden presidency. “Mr Biden’s track record is well established. There is no cause for any worry among Israelis,” he said. “Both candidates are considered pro-Israel.”

Biden was often used as an emissary to Israel during this vice-presidency and has previously described Netanyahu as a friend. This year, however, he said the Israel leader had drifted “so, so far to the right”.

Salem Barahmeh, the executive director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, said Trump had been “extremely dangerous for the entire world, especially for Palestine and our struggle for freedom and rights”.

He added, however, that Trump had merely accelerated long-standing US policy from both Republican and Democrat administrations that allowed Israel to continue the occupation with few significant consequences.

“The Obama administration and Biden were part of that trajectory,” he said. A Biden win may even be counterproductive for the Palestinian rights movement, he added, arguing that Trump exposed US policy in the region for the facade that it was.

“Trump is a polarising figure, he mobilises a lot of resistance,” he said. “With Biden, it would be going back to that normal, but that normal was never good for Palestine and the Palestinians.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605093768930-219fa925e9e9ef41', 'domain': 'theguardian.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/29/israeli-zeal-for-second-trump-term-matched-by-palestinian-enmity', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/29/israeli-zeal-for-second-trump-term-matched-by-palestinian-enmity', 'author': 'Oliver Holmes', 'images': ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2919d60ca65e8bda598c3a33ef18ab3fc406f842/0_208_3114_1868/master/3114.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1906c7e1aa5d2bec34484ddeebc009e6', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2919d60ca65e8bda598c3a33ef18ab3fc406f842/0_208_3114_1868/master/3114.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=0aaa3fdd93553b84e17428c32220f13a'], 'headline': 'Israeli zeal for second Trump term matched by Palestinian enmity', 'mainImage': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2919d60ca65e8bda598c3a33ef18ab3fc406f842/0_208_3114_1868/master/3114.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=689fedbb898e80bf3574c4ec05fbef49', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Anyone in any doubt about Benjamin Netanyahu’s preferred candidate in the US presidential election need only visit his personal Twitter account.\n\nRight at the top, behind the headshot of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, is a banner photo of him with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, their eyes fixed on each other.\n\n“You have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu told his ally during a Washington visit this year. “Frankly, though we’ve had some great, outstanding friends in these halls, it’s not even close.”\n\nThat list includes Barack Obama, whose famously icy relationship with Netanyahu extends by proxy to his vice-president and Trump’s 2020 rival, Joe Biden.\n\nPalestinians see the prospect of a second Trump term as disastrous. “If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us, God help you and God help the whole world,” the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said this month.\n\nTrump has arguably been the US president with most impact on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as he has sought to appeal to his pro-Israel base, including evangelical Christians.

need only visit <a href=""https://twitter.com/netanyahu"" data-link-name=""in body link"">his personal Twitter account</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right at the top, behind the headshot of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, is a <a href=""https://twitter.com/netanyahu/header_photo"" data-link-name=""in body link"">banner photo</a> of him with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, their eyes fixed on each other.</p>\n\n<p>“You have been the greatest friend that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"">Israel</a> has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu told his ally during a Washington visit this year. “Frankly, though we’ve had some great, outstanding friends in these halls, it’s not even close.”</p>\n\n<p>That list includes Barack Obama, whose <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/binyamin-netanyahu-turns-down-meeting-barack-obama"" data-link-name=""in body link"">famously icy</a> relationship with Netanyahu extends by proxy to his vice-president and Trump’s 2020 rival, Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p>Palestinians see the prospect of a second Trump term as disastrous. “If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us, God help you and God help the whole world,” the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said this month.</p>\n\n<p>Trump has arguably been the US president with most impact on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as he has sought to appeal to his pro-Israel base, including evangelical Christians. During the past four years, the US leader has ticked off much on Netanyahu’s hardline nationalist wishlist that was previously considered taboo.</p>\n\n<p>He has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/trump-to-cut-all-us-funding-for-uns-main-palestinian-refugee-programme"" data-link-name=""in body link"">cut hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, declared the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital"" data-link-name=""in body link"">divided city of Jerusalem </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Israel’s capital</a>, shut down Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians"" data-link-name=""in body link"">devised a “peace plan”</a> that affords Israel’s government the vast majority of its demands.</p>\n\n<p>Led by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the Trump administration has also persuaded the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/22/we-feel-betrayed-palestinians-fear-cost-of-arab-states-deals-with-israel"" data-link-name=""in body link"">establish full diplomatic relations with Israel despite the ongoing occupation</a>. It has also imposed further sanctions on Iran, a policy Israel has been advocating against its arch-enemy for years.</p>\n\n<p>“For Netanyahu personally, obviously he has a preference,” said Yohanan Plesner, a former Israeli politician and president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “One of the assets that Mr Netanyahu sells to the Israeli public is his close intimate relationship with Mr Trump.”</p>\n\n<p>Four more years of Trump could be hugely advantageous for the Israeli leader, particularly if Washington can convince more Arab states to establish open ties with Israel with few or no concessions to the Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>A further softening of Washington’s stance on illegal settlements in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"">Palestinian territories</a>, or even recognising annexation moves, could also be on the table. Trump’s US ambassador to Israel and former bankruptcy lawyer, David Friedman, is vocal in his support for Jewish settlements.</p>\n\n<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/15/trump-and-us-global-image-plunge-during-pandemic-survey-finds"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Trump’s image and that of </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/15/trump-and-us-global-image-plunge-during-pandemic-survey-finds"" data-link-name=""in body link"">his country</a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/15/trump-and-us-global-image-plunge-during-pandemic-survey-finds"" data-link-name=""in body link""> may have plummeted</a> worldwide, but many Israelis adore him. According to a <a href=""https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/1602518857-poll-ahead-of-us-elections-63-of-israelis-say-trump-will-be-better-for-israel"" data-link-name=""in body link"">survey conducted for the </a><a href=""https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/1602518857-poll-ahead-of-us-elections-63-of-israelis-say-trump-will-be-better-for-israel"" data-link-name=""in body link""> i24News channel</a>, 63% would prefer him to win the election, compared with less than 19% who would prefer Biden.</p>\n\n<p>Plesner, however, says that does not mean Israelis are overly concerned about a Biden presidency. “Mr Biden’s track record is well established.

A Biden win may even be counterproductive for the Palestinian rights movement, he added, arguing that Trump exposed US policy in the region for the facade that it was.</p>\n\n<p>“Trump is a polarising figure, he mobilises a lot of resistance,” he said. “With Biden, it would be going back to that normal, but that normal was never good for Palestine and the Palestinians.”</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-10-29T13:31:11-0400', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-10-29T02:00:06-0400'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	random	paywall	Karl		Israeli zeal for second Trump term matched by Palestinian enmity
