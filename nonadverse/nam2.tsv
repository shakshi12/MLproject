Carel			https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_16_4452	Why is the Commission proposing a Directive on the criminalisation of money laundering?  Terrorist organisations and organised crime need financing – to maintain their criminal networks, to recruit and supply, and to commit terrorist acts themselves. Money laundering allows criminal organisations to benefit from their illegal activities and maintain their operations. In essence, money laundering uses the earnings generated through a multitude of illegal cross-border activities – such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illicit arms trafficking and corruption – to acquire, convert or transfer property, while hiding the true nature of its origin, in order to use the revenues of these crimes in the legitimate economy. A strengthened criminal response to money laundering contributes to cutting off sources of finance and countering the financial incentives which drive crime, making a powerful contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime.  The current criminal law framework against money laundering in the EU is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently coherent to be fully effective. All Member States criminalise money laundering; however, existing differences in the definition, scope and sanctions of money laundering offences affect cross-border police and judicial cooperation between national authorities as well as the exchange of information. These differences in legal frameworks can also be exploited by criminals and terrorists, who could carry out financial transactions where they perceive anti-money laundering measures to be weakest.  In February 2016, the Commission set out an Action Plan to ensure that Member States have the necessary tools at their disposal to address new threats linked to terrorist financing. The Action Plan recognised that while Member States have criminalised money laundering, there are differences across the EU as to the definition of money laundering and the sanctions applied. To that end the Commission committed to propose a Directive harmonising money laundering offenses and sanctions by the end of 2016.  The measures proposed today will provide for a strengthened legal framework to combat money laundering in the European Union, improve enforcement in this area and reduce the threat from terrorist and organised crime organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities. They will further reinforce the EU's capacity to tackle organised crime and terrorist financing more effectively and more generally enhance the internal security of the EU and the safety of EU citizens.  What are the key objectives of the Directive?  Today's proposal for a Directive aims at tackling money laundering by means of criminal law. It proposes to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering, as well as common provisions to improve the investigation of those offences and to ensure better cooperation in the fight against money laundering.  The Directive aims at implementing international obligations on money laundering and terrorist financing such as the Warsaw Convention and relevant recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  In addition, the proposal will improve cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between competent authorities. All Member States have criminalised money laundering, but there are differences between Member States both on the definition of money laundering and on the sanctions applied to such a crime. These differences create obstacles that hinder cross-border judicial and police cooperation to effectively tackle money laundering. The Directive aims to remove these obstacles by setting up a common definition of money laundering across the EU.  Finally, the measures will help to prevent criminals from exploiting the differences between national legislations to their advantage. A situation where there are widely differing sanctions for money laundering across the EU creates a risk of "forum shopping" by offenders, or in other words – criminals choosing to carry out their crimes where they are less likely to face serious sanctions.  What is the scale of the money laundering problem?  The United Nations estimated the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 at approximately USD 2.1 trillion, which is equivalent to 3.6% of global GDP. The amount of money generated from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the EU has been estimated at €110 billion per year, corresponding to 1% of the EU GDP. For criminals to benefit fully from the proceeds of their crimes, these criminal proceeds need to be laundered.  Criminal investigations on money laundering involving several EU Member States are very frequent. As part of the Commissions consultation process, estimates in one Member State suggest that between 10 to 15% of cases have a cross border dimension. In two Member States the same estimate is 20%, and in a couple of Member States it reaches 70%. Five Member States estimate that the proportion of money laundering investigations with a cross-border element ranges between 38% and 50%.  Eurojust registered 724 cases on money laundering between 2012 and July 2015, rising from 193 cases in 2013 to 286 money laundering cases in 2015. Furthermore, a large number of Member States have estimated the number of Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) with a cross-border dimension to be between 30% and 50%. The number of requests for information and cooperation transmitted through FIU.Net, the information exchange tool of EU Financial Intelligence Units, increased from 12,076 in 2014 to 17,149 in 2015.  What are the links between money laundering and terrorist financing?  Large terrorist groups as well as smaller cells and individuals often finance their attacks and activities through crime. Organised crime can support terrorism, for example through the supply of illegal weapons. Terrorists can use money laundering schemes to convert, conceal or acquire the proceeds of criminal activities.  A strengthened EU legal framework to criminalise money laundering would both help to combat organised crime and contribute to tackling terrorist financing more effectively and reduce the threat from terrorist organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities.  This Directive will also complement the Directive on combating terrorism, which sets a comprehensive definition of the crime of terrorist financing, covering not only terrorist offences but also terrorist-related offences such as recruitment, training and propaganda.  How does this proposal fit in the overall EU framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing?  This proposal is an integral part of the EU response to money laundering and complements measures in place aimed at detecting, disrupting and preventing the abuse of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, notably the revised 4 th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Transfer of Funds Regulation. While these measures help to prevent money laundering and facilitate investigations into money laundering offences, they do not address the absence of a uniform definition of money laundering.  The proposal also reinforces the criminal law framework with regard to offences relating to terrorist groups and the criminalisation of terrorism financing, as included in the proposal for a Directive on combating terrorism.  Will the Directive ensure that the EU is compliant with international standards?  This proposal aims to implement international requirements on the criminalisation of money laundering. The Directive will move the EU closer to meeting its international obligations in this area, such as those set out in the Council of Europe Warsaw Convention, as well as Financial Action Task Force recommendations.  Recommendation 3 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) calls on countries to criminalise money laundering on the basis of the UN Vienna Convention of 1988 and the UN Palermo Convention of 2001. It asks countries to criminalise the laundering of proceeds of all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences (see below for explanation), as well as ancillary activities unless this is not permitted by fundamental principles of domestic law.  The Warsaw Convention is the most comprehensive international convention on money laundering. It requests parties to adopt legislative measures to facilitate the prevention, investigation and prosecution of money laundering as well as the effective freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of crime.  The Warsaw Convention was signed by 26 EU Member States, of which 17 have so far ratified it. The EU signed the Warsaw Convention in 2009 but has not yet ratified it. This proposal for a Directive would be an important step towards ratification of the Warsaw Convention.  What is "self-laundering" and why has the Commission included it in the proposal?  Self-laundering refers to the situation where a person who has committed a crime tries to hide the illicit origins of the proceeds from that crime. Self-laundering is an additional crime, different to the predicate offence, which violates the integrity of the financial market and thus it's important to prosecute those who try and benefit from its proceeds.  As self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions, this can cause difficulties for some Member States in establishing a prosecutable offence and investigating and tracing the flow of illegally acquired funds. Eurojust indicates that the fact that self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions may cause difficulties for some Member States to establish a prosecutable offence and to investigate and trace the flow of “black money”.  What is a "predicate offence"?  In money laundering cases, a predicate offence is the underlying criminal activity which generated the property laundered. An example of a predicate offence can be drug trafficking which leads to profits which may then be laundered.  The definition of predicate offences can vary from country to country.  Why is it necessary to establish a list of predicate offences?  International conventions and FATF recommendations require the inclusion of a number of offences as predicate offences for money laundering such as terrorism, including terrorist financing, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, illicit arms trafficking, environmental crime, fraud, corruption or tax crimes. However, these categories are simply listed and not defined, leaving wide scope for national differences in the range of predicate offences.  By establishing a list of predicate offences, this Directive will therefore make cross-border cooperation more effective, as well as fulfilling international requirements. All the predicate offences listed (except for cybercrime) come from the relevant international conventions which the Directive aims to implement. The references to EU law have been added only for those predicate offences where there is already an existing act at EU level requiring the criminalisation of a certain conduct.  Why did the Commission include cybercrime as predicate offence?  In the context of an increasing threat of cybercrime and attacks against information systems, the Directive also includes "cybercrime" in a list of offences related to terrorist financing. Computer crime is the only area of crime mentioned in Article 83 TFEU which is not listed in the categories of offences designated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Warsaw Convention. The financial impact of cybercrime and the size of related proceeds are hard to quantify, but cases show that proceeds from cybercrime are laundered through sophisticated schemes, involving both traditional and new payment methods. In order to disrupt the financial incentive that drives many cybercrime activities, the proposal qualifies cybercrime as a predicate offence for money laundering.  Does this proposal go beyond international requirements?  In certain areas, this proposal goes beyond international requirements. It establishes the minimum level of the maximum sanctions and it also criminalises "self-laundering" (see above for explanation).  In addition to listing general categories of crime, the list provided in this proposal includes cybercrime and crimes where there is legislation at EU level defining the predicate offences, by making a reference to the relevant EU legislative acts.  What are the next steps of the proposal?  The proposal for a Directive on countering money laundering by criminal law will now be transmitted to the European Parliament and Council for adoption, in line with the normal legislative process. Once adopted, Member States have two years to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law.  To which Member States does the proposal apply?  The proposal applies to all EU Member States except for Denmark, which is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive. The United Kingdom and Ireland can decide to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive.

Money laundering allows criminal organisations to benefit from their illegal activities and maintain their operations. In essence, money laundering uses the earnings generated through a multitude of illegal cross-border activities – such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illicit arms trafficking and corruption – to acquire, convert or transfer property, while hiding the true nature of its origin, in order to use the revenues of these crimes in the legitimate economy. A strengthened criminal response to money laundering contributes to cutting off sources of finance and countering the financial incentives which drive crime, making a powerful contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime.</p>\n\n<p>The current criminal law framework against money laundering in the EU is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently coherent to be fully effective. All Member States criminalise money laundering; however, existing differences in the definition, scope and sanctions of money laundering offences affect cross-border police and judicial cooperation between national authorities as well as the exchange of information. These differences in legal frameworks can also be exploited by criminals and terrorists, who could carry out financial transactions where they perceive anti-money laundering measures to be weakest.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2016, the Commission set out an <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1455113825366&amp;uri=CELEX:52016DC0050">Action Plan </a>to ensure that Member States have the necessary tools at their disposal to address new threats linked to terrorist financing. The Action Plan recognised that while Member States have criminalised money laundering, there are differences across the EU as to the definition of money laundering and the sanctions applied. To that end the Commission committed to propose a Directive harmonising money laundering offenses and sanctions by the end of 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The measures proposed today will provide for a strengthened legal framework to combat money laundering in the European Union, improve enforcement in this area and reduce the threat from terrorist and organised crime organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities. They will further reinforce the EU\'s capacity to tackle organised crime and terrorist financing more effectively and more generally enhance the internal security of the EU and the safety of EU citizens.</p>\n\n<p>What are the key objectives of the Directive?</p>\n\n<p>Today\'s proposal for a Directive aims at tackling money laundering by means of criminal law. It proposes to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering, as well as common provisions to improve the investigation of those offences and to ensure better cooperation in the fight against money laundering.</p>\n\n<p>The Directive aims at <strong>implementing international obligations</strong> on money laundering and terrorist financing such as the Warsaw Convention and relevant recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the proposal will <strong>improve cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information</strong> between competent authorities. All Member States have criminalised money laundering, but there are differences between Member States both on the definition of money laundering and on the sanctions applied to such a crime. These differences create obstacles that hinder cross-border judicial and police cooperation to effectively tackle money laundering. The Directive aims to remove these obstacles by setting up a common definition of money laundering across the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the measures will help to <strong>prevent criminals from exploiting the differences between national legislations</strong> to their advantage. A situation where there are widely differing sanctions for money laundering across the EU creates a risk of "forum shopping" by offenders, or in other words – criminals choosing to carry out their crimes where they are less likely to face serious sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>What is the scale of the money laundering problem?</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations estimated the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 at approximately USD 2.1 trillion, which is equivalent to 3.6% of global GDP. The amount of money generated from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the EU has been estimated at <a href="http://www.transcrime.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ocp.pdf">€110 billion per year</a>, corresponding to 1% of the EU GDP. For criminals to benefit fully from the proceeds of their crimes, these criminal proceeds need to be laundered.</p>\n\n<p>Criminal investigations on money laundering involving several EU Member States are very frequent. As part of the Commissions consultation process, estimates in one Member State suggest that between 10 to 15% of cases have a cross border dimension. In two Member States the same estimate is 20%, and in a couple of Member States it reaches 70%. Five Member States estimate that the proportion of money laundering investigations with a cross-border element ranges between 38% and 50%.</p>\n\n<p>Eurojust registered 724 cases on money laundering between 2012 and July 2015, rising from 193 cases in 2013 to 286 money laundering cases in 2015. Furthermore, a large number of Member States have estimated the number of Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) with a cross-border dimension to be between 30% and 50%. The number of requests for information and cooperation transmitted through FIU.Net, the information exchange tool of EU Financial Intelligence Units, increased from 12,076 in 2014 to 17,149 in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>What are the links between money laundering and terrorist financing?</p>\n\n<p>Large terrorist groups as well as smaller cells and individuals often finance their attacks and activities through crime. Organised crime can support terrorism, for example through the supply of illegal weapons. Terrorists can use money laundering schemes to convert, conceal or acquire the proceeds of criminal activities.</p>\n\n<p>A strengthened EU legal framework to criminalise money laundering would both help to combat organised crime and contribute to tackling terrorist financing more effectively and reduce the threat from terrorist organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities.</p>\n\n<p>This Directive will also complement the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/legislative-documents/docs/20151202_directive_on_combatting_terrorism_en.pdf">Directive on combating terrorism</a>, which sets a comprehensive definition of the crime of terrorist financing, covering not only terrorist offences but also terrorist-related offences such as recruitment, training and propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>How does this proposal fit in the overall EU framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing?</p>\n\n<p>This proposal is an integral part of the EU response to money laundering and complements measures in place aimed at detecting, disrupting and preventing the abuse of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, notably the revised 4<sup>th</sup> Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Transfer of Funds Regulation. While these measures help to prevent money laundering and facilitate investigations into money laundering offences, they do not address the absence of a uniform definition of money laundering.</p>\n\n<p>The proposal also reinforces the criminal law framework with regard to offences relating to terrorist groups and the criminalisation of terrorism financing, as included in the proposal for a Directive on combating terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>Will the Directive ensure that the EU is compliant with international standards?</p>\n\n<p>This proposal aims to implement international requirements on the criminalisation of money laundering. The Directive will move the EU closer to meeting its international obligations in this area, such as those set out in the Council of Europe Warsaw Convention, as well as Financial Action Task Force recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Recommendation 3 of the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </strong>calls on countries to criminalise money laundering on the basis of the UN Vienna Convention of 1988 and the UN Palermo Convention of 2001. It asks countries to criminalise the laundering of proceeds of all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences (see below for explanation), as well as ancillary activities unless this is not permitted by fundamental principles of domestic law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Warsaw Convention</strong> is the most comprehensive international convention on money laundering. It requests parties to adopt legislative measures to facilitate the prevention, investigation and prosecution of money laundering as well as the effective freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of crime.</p>\n\n<p>The Warsaw Convention was signed by 26 EU Member States, of which 17 have so far ratified it. The EU signed the Warsaw Convention in 2009 but has not yet ratified it. This proposal for a Directive would be an important step towards ratification of the Warsaw Convention.</p>\n\n<p>What is "self-laundering" and why has the Commission included it in the proposal?</p>\n\n<p>Self-laundering refers to the situation where a person who has committed a crime tries to hide the illicit origins of the proceeds from that crime. Self-laundering is an additional crime, different to the predicate offence, which violates the integrity of the financial market and thus it\'s important to prosecute those who try and benefit from its proceeds.</p>\n\n<p>As self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions, this can cause difficulties for some Member States in establishing a prosecutable offence and investigating and tracing the flow of illegally acquired funds. Eurojust indicates that the fact that self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions may cause difficulties for some Member States to establish a prosecutable offence and to investigate and trace the flow of “black money”.</p>\n\n<p>What is a "predicate offence"?</p>\n\n<p>In money laundering cases, a predicate offence is the underlying criminal activity which generated the property laundered. An example of a predicate offence can be drug trafficking which leads to profits which may then be laundered.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of predicate offences can vary from country to country.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it necessary to establish a list of predicate offences?</p>\n\n<p>International conventions and FATF recommendations require the inclusion of a number of offences as predicate offences for money laundering such as terrorism, including terrorist financing, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, illicit arms trafficking, environmental crime, fraud, corruption or tax crimes. However, these categories are simply listed and not defined, leaving wide scope for national differences in the range of predicate offences.</p>\n\n<p>By establishing a list of predicate offences, this Directive will therefore make cross-border cooperation more effective, as well as fulfilling international requirements. All the predicate offences listed (except for cybercrime) come from the relevant international conventions which the Directive aims to implement. The references to EU law have been added only for those predicate offences where there is already an existing act at EU level requiring the criminalisation of a certain conduct.</p>\n\n<p>Why did the Commission include cybercrime as predicate offence?</p>\n\n<p>In the context of an increasing threat of cybercrime and attacks against information systems, the Directive also includes "cybercrime" in a list of offences related to terrorist financing.

Shakshi	Arayik Harutyunyan	Individual	https://apnews.com/article/europe-azerbaijan-armenia-b284e57b9f7d50db23c04536d7b90167	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) — The Azerbaijani army closed in Thursday on a key town in Nagorno-Karabakh following more than a month of intense fighting, while top diplomats from Azerbaijan and Armenia prepared for more talks to try to end their long conflict over the separatist territory.  Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, said Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) of the strategically placed town of Shushi. He urged residents to mobilize all their resources to fend off the attack.  “The one who controls Shushi controls Nagorno-Karabakh,” Harutyunyan said in a video address from the town’s cathedral, which was severely damaged by Azerbaijani shelling this month. “We must realize that and take part in defending Shushi. We must reverse the situation.”  Shushi is located about 5 kilometers south of Nagorno-Karabakh’s regional capital, Stepanakert.  Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994.  The latest fighting began Sept. 27 and has involved heavy artillery, rockets and drones, in the largest escalation of hostilities over the separatist region in the quarter-century since the war ended. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people, have been killed in a little over a month.  Separatist authorities of Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azerbaijani forces Thursday of shelling Stepanakert, Shushi and Martakert with Smerch multiple rocket systems, a devastating Soviet-designed weapon intended to ravage wide areas with explosives and cluster munitions. Martakert was also raided by Azerbaijani aircraft, officials said.  Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry denied using aviation and accused Armenian forces of shelling the Terter, Goranboy and Barda regions of Azerbaijan. One civilian was killed in the Goranboy region, according to Hikmet Hajiyev, a foreign policy advisor to the Azerbaijan’s president.  The ministry also reported downing two Armenian Su-25 warplanes, a claim Armenian officials rejected as “disinformation.”  According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, 1,166 of their troops and 39 civilians have been killed in the clashes so far. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t disclosed their military losses, but say the fighting has killed at least 90 civilians and wounded 392.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that, according to Moscow’s information, the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000, a significantly higher number than officially reported.  The hostilities have raged for a fifth week despite international calls for peace and three attempts at establishing a cease-fire. The latest U.S.-brokered truce frayed immediately after it took effect Monday, just like two previous cease-fires negotiated by Russia. The warring sides have repeatedly blamed each other for violations.  Russia, the United States and France have co-chaired the so-called Minsk Group set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate in the conflict, but they have failed to score any progress.  The Minsk Group’s co-chairs were set to meet with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Geneva on Thursday, but the negotiations were pushed back until Friday and the prospects for a breakthrough appeared dim.  Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anna Naghdalyan said the change of date was “linked to the evolving situation and logistical issues,” adding that negotiating a lasting and verifiable cease-fire is a priority for Armenia.  Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedly criticized the Minsk Group for failing to achieve any results in three decades and insisted that Azerbaijan has the right to reclaim its territory by force since international mediation has failed.  Speaking Thursday at an investor conference in Moscow, Putin said that negotiating a settlement for the decades-long conflict is extremely challenging.  “It’s a tight knot, and there are no simple solutions,” Putin said. “Each side has its own truth.”  Russia, which has a military base in Armenia and a security agreement to protect its ally, has been involved in a delicate diplomatic act while trying to also maintain good ties with Azerbaijan and to avoid a showdown with Turkey.  Before the latest escalation of hostilities, Russia proposed a peace plan that would see Azerbaijan reclaim control of several of its regions outside Nagorno-Karabakh that Armenian forces captured during the war that ended in 1994. In exchange, Nagorno-Karabakh would be given security guarantees and a crippling blockade of Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan would be lifted.  Armenia has resisted the plan.  Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, whose homes have been damaged by shelling, also appeared to have little faith in the international peace efforts.  “Neither France nor Russia are doing anything. We are left alone,” Vovik Zakharian, a resident of Shushi, a town that came under repeated shelling, said.  Zakharian, 72, inspected his apartment Thursday after it was damaged in morning strikes.  “We will fight till the end,” he said. “We have to try our best.”	[{'query': {'id': '1605095872736-1e8b63820b7a2797', 'domain': 'apnews.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://apnews.com/article/europe-azerbaijan-armenia-b284e57b9f7d50db23c04536d7b90167', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://apnews.com/article/europe-azerbaijan-armenia-b284e57b9f7d50db23c04536d7b90167', 'author': 'AVET DEMOURIAN', 'headline': 'Azerbaijani forces close in on key town in Nagorno-Karabakh', 'mainImage': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/158459e46bd44af4a97cd48701b8c4a8/3000.jpeg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) — The Azerbaijani army closed in Thursday on a key town in Nagorno-Karabakh following more than a month of intense fighting, while top diplomats from Azerbaijan and Armenia prepared for more talks to try to end their long conflict over the separatist territory.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, said Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) of the strategically placed town of Shushi.

He joined RR Donnelley & Sons directly out of college and worked in various positions to learn his craft. He managed plants in Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina and North Carolina. He eventually became the vice president of manufacturing at the Reno, Nevada, plant. Later, he worked internationally as a vice president at Polestar in Sheffield, England. He was appointed by President George Bush to the Government Printing Office as the Deputy Public Printer in Washington, D.C. Paul became Acting Public Printer in 2010 after the resignation of Bob Tapella. He retired in 2012.  He was honored to receive the AHS Distinguished Alumi award in 2009.  Many of Paul’s family and friends would say that he lived life to the fullest. He enjoyed playing and watching all sports, but most especially golf, skiing, and football (Go Vikings!). Paul and his family regularly took vacations to Minnesota and met with more family while traveling the nation and the world. After retirement, Paul, and his wife, Misty, lived their dream of traveling in a motorhome across the United States. They settled in at Cocopah, near Yuma, Arizona. Paul will always be remembered for his kind heart, his laughter, his boisterous voice and his singing.  He was a devoted husband and father and his family always came first.  He is survived by his wife, Misty Campbell Erickson; his daughter, Cari Erickson Messerschmitt (Jamie); grandson, Felix; son, Clayton Erickson; in-laws, Robert and Judy Campbell; and siblings, nieces, nephews and their families. He was preceded in death by his mother, Lois Slater Erickson; his father, Palmer Erickson; and his step-mother, Norma Dalager Erickson.  He will continue to be in our hearts and souls forever.

Shakshi	University of Oslo	Organization	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oslo	Central campus of the university, where today only the faculty of law is located. These buildings were inspired by the famous buildings of Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Berlin.  The University of Oslo (Norwegian: Universitetet i Oslo; Latin: Universitas Osloensis), until 1939 named the Royal Frederick University (Norwegian: Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet; Latin: Universitas Regia Fredericiana), is the oldest university in Norway, located in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Until 1 January 2016 it was the largest Norwegian institution of higher education in terms of size, now surpassed only by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. [3] The Academic Ranking of World Universities has ranked it the 58th best university in the world and the third best in the Nordic countries. [4] In 2015, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked it the 135th best university in the world and the seventh best in the Nordics. [5] While in its 2016, Top 200 Rankings of European universities, the Times Higher Education listed the University of Oslo at 63rd, making it the highest ranked Norwegian university. [6]  The university has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. [7] Its faculties include (Lutheran) Theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), Law, Medicine, Humanities, Mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, Dentistry, and Education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as CICERO, NKVTS and the Frisch Centre.  The university was founded in 1811 and was modeled after the University of Copenhagen and the recently established University of Berlin. It was originally named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway and received its current name in 1939. The university is informally also known as Universitetet ("the university"), having been the only university in Norway, until 1946 and was commonly referred to as "The Royal Frederick's" (Det Kgl. Frederiks), prior to the name change.  The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and will be so again in 2020, making it the only university in the world to be involved in awarding a Nobel Prize. [8] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates. [9]  Early history[ edit ]  King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway was the founder of the university  In 1811, a decision was made to establish the first university in the Dano-Norwegian Union, after an agreement was reached with King Frederik VI, who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies. In 1813, The Royal Frederik's University was founded in Christiania (later renamed Oslo), a small city at that time. Circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement [ clarification needed ] of the university, as Norway proclaimed independence. However, independence was somewhat restricted, as Norway was obliged to enter into a legislative union with Sweden based on the outcome of the War of 1814. Norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions, although royal power and foreign affairs were shared [ clarification needed ] with Sweden. At a time when Norwegians feared political domination by the Swedes, the new university became a key institution that contributed to Norwegian political and cultural independence.  The main initial function of The Royal Frederick University was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants, as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers. The university also became the centre for a survey of the country—a survey of culture, language, history and folk traditions. The staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society. Throughout the 1800s, the university's academic disciplines gradually became more specialised.  One of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research, the management of the university became more professional, academic subjects were reformed, and the forms of teaching evolved. Classical education came under increasing pressure. [ clarification needed ]  When the union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security. Education, health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university's graduates.  1900–1945[ edit ]  Research changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods, scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research. It was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers. Scientific research—whether to launch or test out new theories, to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplines—became part of the increased expectations placed on the university. Developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge, not merely competence in theology or law, for example. The university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation.  The position of rector was established by Parliament in 1905 following the Dissolution of the Union. Waldemar Christofer Brøgger was Professor of Geology and became the university's first rector. Brøgger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives. With the establishment of the national research council after World War II, Brøgger's vision was largely fulfilled; research received funding independent of teaching. This coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s, which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching. In the years leading up to 1940, research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation, with progress and self-assertion; research was also seen to contribute to Norway's commitment to international academic and cultural development.  During the period after World War I, research among Norwegian researchers resulted in two Nobel prizes. The Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch. The Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Odd Hassel. In the field of linguistics, several Norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally. Increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included Norway. Student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940, and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical, gender and social bases. The working class was still largely left behind, however.  During the German occupation, which lasted from 1940–1945, the university rector, Didrik Arup Seip, was imprisoned. The university was then placed under the management of Adolf Hoel, a NS (Norwegian Nazi Party) appointee. A number of students participated in the Norwegian resistance movement; after fire was set in the university auditorium, Reich Commissar Terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested. A number of students and teachers were detained by the Germans nearly until the end of the war.  1945–2000[ edit ]  After WWII, public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance; the State Educational Loan Fund for Young Students was established in 1947. As a result, the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers. Many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war; they could now enroll. For the 1945 autumn semester, 5951 students registered at the university. This represented the highest student enrollment at UiO up to that time. In 1947, the number had risen to more than 6000 students. This represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled prior to the war.  In no previous period had a single decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s. The decade represented an unparalleled period of growth. From 1960 to 1970, student enrollment tripled, rising from 5,600 to 16,800. This tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived, from both the inside and the outside. As it turned out, the changes were even more comprehensive. The university campus at Blindern was expanded, and the number of academic and administrative employees rose. The number of academic positions doubled, from fewer than 500 to around 1,200. The increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation. The expansion of the Blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students. The explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the Blindern campus in particular. The faculties situated in central Oslo—Law and Medicine—experienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s, while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled.  By 1968, revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students. The "Student Uprising" became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world. Often, the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak. More than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models. The "University of the Masses" was unable to lift all its students to the "lofty, elite positions" enjoyed by previous generations of academics. Many students dissociated themselves, therefore, from the so-called "establishment" and the way the establishment functioned. Many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society. It was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged.  The most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of women students. Throughout the 1970s, the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students. At the same time, the university became a centre for the organised women's liberation movement, which emerged in the 1970s.  Up until the millennium, the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partially to the poor labour market.  The highest position at the university is Professor, i.e. "full Professor." In Norway, the title "Professor," which is protected by law, is only used for full professors. Prior to 1990, all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the King-in-Council, i.e. by the King upon the advice of the Cabinet. The position below Professor was historically Docent (translated as Reader in a UK context and Professor in an American context). In 1985, all Docents became full professors. The most common positions below that are førsteamanuensis (translated as Associate Professor), and amanuensis or universitetslektor (translated as Lecturer or Assistant Professor). At the University of Oslo, almost all new permanent positions are announced at the Associate Professor level; an associate professor may apply for promotion to full professor if he or she holds the necessary competence.  Additionally, there are temporary, qualifying positions such as stipendiat (Research Fellow) and postdoktor (Postdoctoral Fellow).  A small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks researcher, senior researcher and research professor, which correspond to assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.  Several other less common academic positions also exist. Historically, only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university. Originally, all professors were automatically members of the Collegium Academicum, the highest governing body of the university, but soon afterwards its membership was limited. Docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. In 1975, the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies, as the last group. Formerly by law, and now by tradition, the highest positions, such as Rector or Dean, are only held by professors. They are elected by the academic community (academics and students) and by the technical-administrative support staff, but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight.  The university's research structure consists of eight schools, or "faculties." They are the Faculties of Dentistry, Educational Sciences, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Theology. [10]  The university's old campus, strongly influenced by Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel 's neoclassical style, is located in the centre of Oslo near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace and the Parliament. The old campus was then occupied by the Faculty of Law and most of the other faculties have been transferred to the Blindern campus in the suburban West End, erected in the 1930s. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area.  The Faculty of Theology sponsors 8 research groups in the following fields: [11]  The New Testament Historical Protestantism Interreligious studies Jewish Religion and Literature in Persian and Hellenistic Periods Canon and Canonicalization Gender, Theology and Religion Professional Ethics, Diaconal Science and Practical Theology Religious Esthetics  Law[ edit ]  Centre for European Law Department of Criminology and the Sociology of Law Department of Private Law Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law (NRCCL) Department of Public and International Law Norwegian Centre for Human Rights Scandinavian Institute of Maritime Law [12]  The Faculty of Law. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in this building until 1989.  The library building at the Blindern campus, houses the Library of Arts and Social Sciences.

Most of them were established by the University of Oslo, but have been organised as entities formally separate from the university for various reasons.

The university is home to five Nobel Prize winners and is institutionally tied to some of the most prestigious prizes in the world. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's atrium between 1947 and 1989, thus making it the only university to host a Nobel Prize ceremony. [13] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the university's atrium.  In July 2015, the University received intense criticism for allowing Anders Behring Breivik to be admitted to study for a 3-year baccalaureate degree in political science (including courses on democracy, human rights, and respect for minorities). He is the perpetrator of the 22 July, 2011 Norway attacks, Norway's worst incident of violence since World War II; he received 21 years in prison (he can be paroled after 10 years; but he can be confined after the 21 years are up, allowable for five years at a time, if he is viewed as still dangerous, resulting in an actual life sentence). The Rector said they were obliged to follow the regulations, which allowed it because his grades were good enough. It will be done in solitary confinement, with guards delivering his assignments and the finished work and the grades. [14] In October 2018, it was reported that course materials were being provided to Breivik by a prison officer and that he had no contact with students or academics or access to the internet. [15]  Some of the notable academics of the university are:  Vilhelm Aubert (Professor of Sociology) Fredrik Barth (Professor of Social Anthropology) Jon Bing (Professor of Law; pioneer of legal informatics) Nils Christie (Professor of Criminology) Ole-Johan Dahl (Professor of Computer Science) Tove Stang Dahl (Professor of Law; pioneer of feminist jurisprudence) Ragnar Frisch (Professor of Economics) Ivar Giæver (Professor of Physics) Johan Galtung (Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies; founder of the field) Victor Goldschmidt (Professor of Mineralogy and Petrography, founder of geochemistry and crystal chemistry) Erik Grønseth (Professor of Sociology; founder of Norwegian family sociology) Francis Hagerup (Professor of Law) Viggo Hagstrøm (Professor of Law) Odd Hassel (Professor of Chemistry) Harriet Holter (Professor of Social Psychology) Trygve Haavelmo (Professor of Economics) Thomas Mathiesen (Professor of Sociology) Fridtjof Nansen (Professor of Zoology) Arnved Nedkvitne (Professor of History) Arne Næss (Professor of Philosophy; founder of deep ecology) Trygve Reenskaug (Professor of Informatics) Vibeke Roggen (Assoicate Professor of Classics)  Alumni[ edit ]  Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) – mathematician, the Abel Prize in mathematics is named in his honour Gro Harlem Brundtland – Former prime minister of Norway.

Carel	Grant Shapps	Individual	https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13132699/travellers-denmark-banned-uk-mink-covid/	TRAVELLERS from Denmark have been barred from entering the UK after wide-scale outbreaks of a new strain of Covid-19 at mink factories.  The development - a 'virologist's worst nightmare' - has resulted in the first-ever travel ban implemented by Britain during the pandemic.  5  It comes after health officials say the new strain shows decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the effectiveness of future vaccines.  A genetically stable virus - as has been the case so far - is a steady target for scientists working to develop a jab. But the news from Denmark could change the goalposts for experts.  Downing Street had already taken action to remove Denmark from the travel corridor, forcing arrivals to isolate for two weeks from Friday at 4am.  But following a Covid committee meeting on Friday afternoon, No10 now has banned all non-British national or resident travellers who have been in or transited through Denmark in the past 14 days.  Throughout the pandemic, officials have warned against all but essential travel to countries with rising cases.  Initially, quarantine measures were put in place for people arriving to the UK from early hotspots China and Italy.  However, it's the first time an outright ban has been announced.  Brits in Denmark are allowed to return, and the first flight affected - British Airways flight 811 from Copenhagen - touched down at Heathrow shortly before 8am on Saturday.  But all travellers who have been to the country in the past fortnight - as well as all members of their household - must now isolate for 14 days.  Meanwhile, NHS test and trace will prioritise contacting all those who have recently returned.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter: “This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms.  "Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority.”  England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty is understood to be particularly worried about the situation in Denmark.  Authorities in the country recently found a mutated form of coronavirus that can pass to humans in mink farms.  Millions of the animals are to be slaughtered after the strain was discovered at more than 200 Danish mink farms.  And it's sparked a fresh lockdown in parts of the country, where bars, restaurants, public transport and all public indoor sports will be closed in seven North Jutland municipalities.  The restrictions will come into effect from today and initially last for a month - until December 3.  The World Health Organisation said mink appear to be "good reservoirs" of coronavirus.  Around five new strains of the virus have been found - and at least 12 people were infected with the virus as a direct result so far.  5  Despite that, officials believe the situation could be much worse than they already know.  Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said about half of the 783 human cases reported in north Denmark related to a strain of the virus that originated in the mink farms.  And the country's prime minister Mette Frederiksen said there were now fears that the new, mutated virus posed a "risk to the effectiveness" of a future vaccine.  "It is very, very serious," she added.  "The mutated virus in mink can have devastating consequences worldwide.  “We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well."  Denmark is one of the world's main mink fur exporters - producing millions of furs per year.  Police said the culling of the 15 million mink should happen as soon as possible and would cost the nation around £600m.  A spokeswoman from the Department for Transport said: “Unlike other travel to the UK, there will be no exemptions to this quarantine policy.  “The UK Government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the UK to inform our risk assessments.”  Under England's new national lockdown, all international travel is prohibited - unless it's for business.  Anyone going on a break away faces a £200 fine for doing so, it was revealed this week.  The decision comes after Germany and Sweden were chucked off the travel corridor list too, forcing anyone returning to isolate for two weeks.

yesterday - although official figures suggest the second wave is beginning to slow</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite that, officials believe the situation could be much worse than they already know.</p>\n<p>Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said about half of the 783 human cases reported in north Denmark related to a strain of the virus that originated in the mink farms.</p>\n<p>And the country\'s prime minister Mette Frederiksen said there were now fears that the new, mutated virus posed a "risk to the effectiveness" of a future vaccine.</p>\n<p>"It is very, very serious," she added. </p>\n<p>"The mutated virus in mink can have devastating consequences worldwide.</p>\n<p>“We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well."</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/denmark/">Denmark</a> is one of the world\'s main mink fur exporters - producing millions of furs per year.</p>\n<p>Police said the culling of the 15 million mink should happen as soon as possible and would cost the nation around £600m.</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman from the Department for Transport said: “Unlike other travel to the UK, there will be no exemptions to this quarantine policy.</p>\n<p>“The UK Government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the UK to inform our risk assessments.”</p>\n<p>Under England\'s new national lockdown, all international travel is prohibited - unless it\'s for business.</p>\n<div class="sun-row "><div class="col sun-col-6"><div class="rail rail--classic rail--trending undefined

Carel			https://www.thedailystar.net/business/combatting-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-158686	Bangladesh's story is one of miraculous success, especially in terms of macro and micro indicators of economic and social development. Beginning with a mere $100 per capita income in the early 1970s, today Bangladesh can boast about crossing the World Bank-defined low-income economy threshold by achieving $1,200-plus per capita income.  The growth performance of Bangladesh has also been spectacular, with average annual growth of 6.14 percent over the past 12 years, and what is more remarkable is that the standard deviation of the growth rate in that time was as low as a quarter of a percent. This is lowest not only in South Asia but also in the global context.  Bangladesh also experienced strong external sector gains with positive balance of payments (BOP) current account balance and a record foreign exchange reserve of more than $26 billion.  Poverty has declined from around the 80 percent range in the early 1970s to 25 percent, and extreme poverty is estimated to have fallen below 13 percent in 2015. Life expectancy rose by 10 years, from 59 to 69; girls' education increased significantly and performance in reducing infant mortality rate and post-natal deaths has become a global role model.  As far as the demographic dividend is concerned, Bangladesh is at a vantage point as majority of the population is young. The economy is transforming in a big way wherein agriculture is no longer the dominant source of employment and income.  Bangladesh for its sustained growth has achieved Ba3 (Moody's) and BB- (Standard and Poor's) with a stable outlook for the sixth consecutive year. Stable real GDP growth and strong external balances have helped Bangladesh achieve BB- rating with stable outlook from Fitch Ratings for the second time this year.  While there is no doubt about the growth potential of Bangladesh, the question is how to capitalise all these positive features to a higher growth trajectory and sustain the momentum to consolidate Bangladesh's position as a solid middle-income country in the next 15 years.  The major challenges Bangladesh faces today are climate change and sustainable development. But there are other issues such as macroeconomic stability, public and private investment, domestic resource mobilisation, infrastructure development, and poverty reduction.  There two other issues that pose serious challenge to growth -- money laundering and terrorist financing. These issues are major threats to the integrity of our financial system, and they are not just issues of concern locally.  In fact, over the past twenty years crimes related to money laundering and terrorist financing have emerged as potential threats to global economy. As we are living in a globalised world, every concern that affects others has a deep impact on us as well.  The first convention titled Vienna Convention to combat money laundering was signed in 1998 and became effective in 1990 with signatories including the EU and G7 countries. In relation to that an international body -- Financial Action Task Force (FATF) -- was established to oversee the implementation of the principles of the convention. The issue of combating terrorist financing was taken into serious consideration immediately after the 9/11 incident on the World Trade Centre in 2001.  The FATF is responsible for developing an international standard for anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism issues and works closely with other global organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and United Nations. The FATF has also regional bodies for effective coordination globally. In 1997 the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on money laundering was established.  In line with international efforts, Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to prevent money laundering and combat terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Bangladesh is a founding member of APG and first in the South Asian region to promulgate Money Laundering Prevention Act in line with recommendations from FATF in 2002. Since 1997, Bangladesh has been regularly participating annual plenary meetings of APG. The Money Laundering Prevention Act was replaced by the Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance in 2008, and the Anti-Terrorism Ordinance was also enacted the same year. These two were later passed by the parliament as Money Laundering Prevention Act and Anti-Terrorism Act in 2009, after which Bangladesh issued Money Laundering Prevention Rules and formulated Anti-Terrorism Rules in 2013.  The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit was established in 2012 to receive, analyse and disseminate suspicious transaction reports, cash transaction reports and complaints. Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit is responsible for exchanging information related to money laundering and terrorist financing with its foreign counterparts. The intelligence unit has also achieved membership of Egmont Group in 2013. The purpose of the group is to provide a forum for financial intelligent units of government organisations of different countries to improve support for each other.  Bangladesh had its first mutual evaluation by a joint team from World Bank and IMF in 2002, and adoption by Asia-Pacific Group in 2003 followed by a second mutual evaluation in 2008.  Bangladesh's banking sector has come of age and when it comes to adopting international best practices this sector has always been pioneer. What is important now is to identify and assess the existing, emerging and also future risks and look closely into vulnerabilities within the current banking practices and procedures.  In the wake of recent incidents, we have to be extra cautious about money laundering and financing of terrorist. It is high time for banks to prioritise unity against money laundering and terrorist financing activities to protect the integrity and stability of Bangladesh's financial system.  Money launderers and terrorist financiers exploit loopholes and move their funds to or through jurisdictions with weak or ineffective legal and institutional frameworks.  Money laundering has potentially devastating economic, security, and social consequences. It allows drug dealers, smugglers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, and corrupt officials to operate and expand their networks.  Money laundering diminishes government tax revenue and thereby indirectly harms honest taxpayers. This also makes government tax collection much more difficult because the loss of revenue means higher tax rates, and corruption-inflated higher costs of public works.  Money laundering distorts assets and commodity prices and leads to misallocation of resources. This creates an unstable liability base and unsound asset structures for financial institutions, creating risks of monetary instability and even systemic crisis. This crisis further leads to loss of credibility and investors' confidence and the potential of destabilising financial systems, particularly in emerging economies.  The social and political cost of money laundering is serious as this money may be used to corrupt national institutions. Laundered money is also spent as kickbacks to government officials, which undermines the moral fabric in society.  The banking sector is now in the process of implementing Basel III. Automation is one key tool for combating money laundering and terrorist financing and recent progress in the banking sector is noteworthy.  The major achievements in automations include an automated Credit Information Bureau, introduction of LC monitoring system, and modernisation of payment systems.  A delegation of Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering is visiting Bangladesh now to review the preventive steps taken by the Bangladesh government against militancy and terrorism finance and the effectiveness of the banking sector in implementing legal, regulatory and operational measures for the same.  As a nation we cannot afford to have our country's image tarnished because of money laundering and terrorist financing issues, especially in today's global economy. We have to be vigilant and guard the integrity of our financial system for financial and social stability. Failure to effectively combat these dark forces will have adverse impact on us, like our international ratings will go down, and we will lose competitive advantages: cost of foreign trade will be higher, foreign loans will fall, and most importantly, the country's image will suffer. And we cannot afford to have that when we are moving forward to achieve the middle-income country status by 2021.

Beginning with a mere $100 per capita income in the early 1970s, today Bangladesh can boast about crossing the World Bank-defined low-income economy threshold by achieving $1,200-plus per capita income.\n\nThe growth performance of Bangladesh has also been spectacular, with average annual growth of 6.14 percent over the past 12 years, and what is more remarkable is that the standard deviation of the growth rate in that time was as low as a quarter of a percent. This is lowest not only in South Asia but also in the global context.\n\nBangladesh also experienced strong external sector gains with positive balance of payments (BOP) current account balance and a record foreign exchange reserve of more than $26 billion.\n\nPoverty has declined from around the 80 percent range in the early 1970s to 25 percent, and extreme poverty is estimated to have fallen below 13 percent in 2015. Life expectancy rose by 10 years, from 59 to 69; girls' education increased significantly and performance in reducing infant mortality rate and post-natal deaths has become a global role model.\n\nAs far as the demographic dividend is concerned, Bangladesh is at a vantage point as majority of the population is young. The economy is transforming in a big way wherein agriculture is no longer the dominant source of employment and income.\n\nBangladesh for its sustained growth has achieved Ba3 (Moody's) and BB- (Standard and Poor's) with a stable outlook for the sixth consecutive year. Stable real GDP growth and strong external balances have helped Bangladesh achieve BB- rating with stable outlook from Fitch Ratings for the second time this year.\n\nWhile there is no doubt about the growth potential of Bangladesh, the question is how to capitalise all these positive features to a higher growth trajectory and sustain the momentum to consolidate Bangladesh's position as a solid middle-income country in the next 15 years.\n\nThe major challenges Bangladesh faces today are climate change and sustainable development. But there are other issues such as macroeconomic stability, public and private investment, domestic resource mobilisation, infrastructure development, and poverty reduction.\n\nThere two other issues that pose serious challenge to growth -- money laundering and terrorist financing. These issues are major threats to the integrity of our financial system, and they are not just issues of concern locally.\n\nIn fact, over the past twenty years crimes related to money laundering and terrorist financing have emerged as potential threats to global economy.

Shakshi	Kassym-Jomart Tokayev	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassym-Jomart_Tokayev	Jump to navigation Jump to search  Kassym-Jomart Kemeluly Tokayev (Kazakh: Қасым-Жомарт Кемелұлы Тоқаев, Qasym-Jomart Kemeluly Toqaev, [qɑˈsəm ʒɔˈmɑrt kɛˌmɛluˈlə tɔˈqɑjɪf], born 17 May 1953) is a Kazakh politician and diplomat. He took office as the president of Kazakhstan on 20 March 2019, [1] [2] succeeding Nursultan Nazarbayev, who resigned on 19 March 2019 after 29 years in office. [3] Tokayev was elected president of Kazakhstan in a snap election on 9 June 2019 with 71% of the popular vote. [4] According to the OSCE, "significant irregularities were observed on election day, including cases of ballot box stuffing, and a disregard of counting procedures meant that an honest count could not be guaranteed." "There were widespread detentions of peaceful protesters on election day in major cities", said the OSCE in their Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions. [5]  He was Chair of the Senate of Kazakhstan from 11 January 2007 to 15 April 2011 and from 16 October 2013 to 19 March 2019. [6] Tokayev served as Prime Minister of Kazakhstan from 1 October 1999 to 28 January 2002 and as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva from 12 March 2011 to 16 October 2013.  Early life[ edit ]  Born in Almaty, his father, Kemel Tokayev (1923–1986), was a World War II veteran and a well-known Kazakh writer. His mother, Turar Shabarbayeva (1931–2000), worked at the Alma-Ata Institute of Foreign Languages. He was named after his uncle who was also a Red Army soldier and was killed during the Battle of Rzhev. When describing the impact the war had on his father, Tokayev said that he "did not like to talk about the war" and only shared his feelings upon "his first encounter with the enemy, the courage of the average soldier, and his burning desire to return home". [7] Kemel Tokayev after the war received a medal for his coverage of the development of the Virgin Lands campaign.  Career[ edit ]  From 1970, Tokayev attended the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. In his fifth year, he was sent to training courses at the Soviet embassy in China for six months. Upon graduation from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1975, Tokayev joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR and was posted to the Soviet Embassy in Singapore. In 1979, he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR. In 1983, he went to China for training courses at the Beijing Language Institute. In 1984–1985, he served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was then posted to the Soviet embassy in Beijing where he served until 1991 as Second Secretary, First Secretary, and Counsellor. In 1991, he enrolled at the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR in Moscow in a training course for senior diplomats.  In 1992, Tokayev was appointed as a Deputy Foreign Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In 1993, he became First Deputy Foreign Minister and in 1994 he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Prime Minister (1999-2002)[ edit ]  In March 1999, he was promoted to the post of Deputy Prime Minister. In October 1999, with the endorsement of the Parliament, he was appointed Prime Minister by Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In January 2002, he resigned and was subsequently appointed Secretary of State – Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Tokayev held the post of Foreign Minister for ten years (1994–1999, 2002–2007).  As a Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tokayev played an active role in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. In 1995 and 2005, he participated in the Review Conferences for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in New York City. In 1996, he signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in New York, and in 2005 the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone in Central Asia (CANWFZ) in Semipalatinsk. He was elected Chairman of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Commonwealth of Independent States and of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Tokayev took part in ten sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. He held a diplomatic rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. Tokayev continued to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs until January 2007 when he was elected as a Chairman of the Senate of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  As Chairman of the Senate of the Parliament of Kazakhstan, Tokayev was elected in 2008 Vice-President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). His view on the political system of Kazakhstan: "Strong President, authoritative Parliament, accountable Government" as he said at the Parliamentarian Conference in Nur-Sultan.  Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva[ edit ]  Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with Sergey Lavrov and John Kerry on 13 September 2013  In March 2011, the Secretary-General of the United Nations announced the appointment of Tokayev as Under Secretary-General, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva and Personal Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General to the Conference on Disarmament. He served as Secretary-General of the Conference on Disarmament. He was also the Designated Official for safety and security of UN personnel for Switzerland.  Tokayev holds a Doctorate in Political Science. He is the author of nine books and numerous articles on international affairs. He is a Fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science, a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons at the Munich Security Conference, an Honorary Professor of Shenzhen University, an Honorary Professor and Doctor of the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, as well as a member of its Board of Trustees. He is also Honorary Dean of the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations. As Director-General of UNOG, he received the "Academicus" award from the University of Geneva. According to the Russian Biographic Institution, Tokayev was admitted as a "Person of the year – 2018".  Presidency[ edit ]  On 19 March 2019, then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced his resignation. According to the Constitution of Kazakhstan, in case of early termination of powers, the Speaker of the Senate becomes President until the next election. [8] On 20 March 2019, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev officially took office as president. [9] [1] [10] Immediately after the inauguration, Tokayev proposed renaming the capital city of Kazakhstan after his predecessor, and the same day the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved the renaming of Astana to Nur-Sultan. [11] [12] Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Tokayev, inviting him to visit Moscow in a joint telephone conversation with him and Nazarbayev. [13] The Chinese government also described Tokayev as an "old friend" and "good friend". [14]  Tokayev and Putin in the Kremlin, 4 April 2019  On 9 April 2019, Tokayev announced early elections in June 2019. [15] On 23 April, Tokayev became a candidate for president following his nomination by the Nur Otan party. [16] [17] During the campaign, Tokayev was mocked on social media for his use of photo manipulation software to erase his wrinkles and double chin from official photos. [18] Tokayev was elected president of Kazakhstan on 9 June with 71% of the popular vote. [4] He was congratulated by foreign heads of state such as Xi Jinping, Ilham Aliyev, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Emomali Rahmon, and Sooronbay Jeenbekov. [19] [20] [21] [22]  President Tokayev delivered his first state-of-the-nation address on 2 September 2020. [23] The address focused on strengthening civil society and social security, supporting domestic business and economic development.  In October 2019, it was announced that all potential ministerial candidates needed the approval of Nazarbayev before being appointed, with the exception of Minister of Defence, Interior Minister and Foreign Minister. [24] After the Bek Air Flight 2100 crash, Tokayev declared the following day, 28 December, a national day of mourning and said that "all those responsible will be severely punished in accordance with the law". [25] He also ordered the suspension of the flight authorization of Bek Air, the domestic airline involved. [26]  On 29 February 2020, in an interview to "Informburo" news agency, Tokayev commented on the fate of Mukhtar Dzhakishev: "This issue is exclusively within the competence of the court. Of course, I am aware that Dzhakishev has repeatedly applied for parole on ill-health. The session of the court of first instance will be held on 3 March. Let’s wait for its decision, which I am sure will be fair." On 3 March 2020, the Court of the Semey city upheld the motion to grant parole to Dzhakishev. He served a 14-year prison sentence since 2009.  On 15 March 2020, due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, President Tokayev signed a Decree on the introduction of a state of emergency in the country. The state of emergency will remain in effect from 16 March to 15 April. On 16 March 2020, during his televised address to the people of Kazakhstan, President Tokayev stressed that he had signed a special decree on measures to ensure the stability of the state functioning. These documents enable us to increase the efficiency of state bodies, strengthen the vertical of power and make all necessary decisions promptly in a manual mode.  In the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in Kazakhstan in 2020, Tokayev ordered the cancellations of both the Nowruz celebrations as well as the military parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. [27] [28] [29]  On 2 May 2020, Nazarbayev's daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva was removed from the Senate and her role as the Chair by order of President Tokayev. [30] Many theories arose that this was a sign of either Tokayev was expanding his political influence or a growing feud between the ruling elite. [31]  Political reforms[ edit ]  In May 2020, President Tokayev signed the laws “On the procedure for organizing and holding peaceful assemblies in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, “On introducing amendments to the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan“, “On Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, and “On introducing amendments and additions to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Political Parties”. [32] The new laws are an important part of the measures to strengthen the state’s democratic foundations, and enhance the role of civil society. [32] In his state of the nation address, he emphasised that "Kazakhstan must create a multiparty system to build a modern, effective state", also saying that the ruling Nur Otan party should collaborate more with other parties. [33] [34]  President Tokayev advocated political reforms that would promote the concept of a "state that listens" to civil society creating a constructive dialogue. [35] Tokayev initiated the establishment of the new National Council of Public Trust to facilitate this dialogue. [35]  Foreign policy[ edit ]  Tokayev and Moon Jae In in Nur-Sultan.  President Tokayev pledged continuity of foreign policy initiated by President Nazarbayev. This means the continuation of measures to attract foreign investments, multi-vector foreign policy and ensuring security in the region. [36] In his first month in office, he had already met 4 world leaders, 2 of them abroad and the other two in Nur-Sultan. Two weeks after taking office, Tokayev visited Moscow in his first foreign state visit on 4 April, meeting with Putin alongside other Russian officials. [37] During the visit, Putin offered Russian assistance to Tokayev in the construction of a proposed nuclear power plant in the country. [38] On 14 April, Tokayev visited neighboring Uzbekistan for talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. [39] He had also received South Korean President Moon Jae In and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during the month of April. On 16–17 May, Tokayev hosted foreign leaders such as Armen Sarkissian and Mamuka Bakhtadze in the capital for the 12th annual Astana Economic Forum, the first to be hosted by its pioneer, President Nazarbayev. [40] He also hosted the regional leaders of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Armenia and Moldova for the Eurasian Economic Union and Supreme Eurasian Economic Council summit on 29 May. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan in late 2019, he visited the House-Museum of Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov in Bishkek, where he met with the late writer's wife and reminisced about his first encounters with Aitmatov in Beijing in 1989. [41] On 4 December, on the eve of a state visit to Germany, he gave an interview to Deutsche Welle, in which he called Germany a "key European partner for Kazakhstan". [42] In that same interview, he drew controversy by saying that he did not believe the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation was an invasion while also saying that he believed in the "wisdom of the Russian leadership", drawing condemnation from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who issued a demarche in response. [43]  The President maintained strong relations with Kazakhstan's strategic allies, including the U.S. In June 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated President Tokayev on his one-year anniversary of presidency. In his congratulatory letter, Trump expressed his support for the reforms that had been undertaken in Kazakhstan, and reaffirmed his intention to further develop strategic partnership between the two countries.

[56] [57] His brother-in-law Temirtai Izbastin (married to Tokayev's sister Karlyga Izbastina) is currently Kazakhstan’s Ambassador to Bulgaria. [58] A native speaker of Kazakh, Tokayev is also fluent in Russian, Mandarin [59] [60] and English and has knowledge of French. [55] He was President of the Table Tennis Federation of Kazakhstan for 13 years. [55] He has made it a point not to mark his birthday with celebrations, with his press secretary saying in 2020 that he "does not like to celebrate this day because his family has never celebrated the birthdays of either the children and parents".

Carel	Accenture	Organization	https://cloudtweaks.com/2016/10/deep-learning-ai-fintech/	Deep Learning  Financial services have been revolutionised over the last 20 years by increasingly powerful technology such as big data analytics, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning. Now, Fintech is on the cusp of a truly revolutionary moment, the integration of AI and deep learning into financial services. This combination really has the potential to revolutionise money and the global financial landscape in ways we never could have imagined 20 years ago. This is hardly by accident, a 2015 report by Accenture tracked the global investment in Fintech; revealing it has jumped from $930 million in 2008 to over $12 billion by the start of 2015.  Data Explosion  The explosion of data over the last 10 years has been incredible, and has been so vast that there has been little way to comprehend it without intelligent automated support. As analytics advances, so does the need for increased computational power to crunch the big numbers, and AI systems are becoming easier and easier to develop adapt and integrate.  Many companies already use programs like Kasisto, a KAI powered conversational UX, to help to improve customer service and connect customers to products and services. Kasisto are currently pioneering the use of their bot to help people manage stocks and portfolios (check it out here). However, this has been around for a few years now, and it really only scratches the surface of how AI is going to transform Fintech. AI and Machine Learning is being applied across the financial world, this is the next step in financial evolution. Fintech start-ups such as Affirm, Zest Finance, and Kensho, have applied deep learning to improve decision making and financial processing. Zest Finance are redefining credit scores and challenging the use of “ little data ”, using big data analytics to provide a much more accurate credit score than is possible in the current system.  Machine Learning Algorithms  One of the key features of emerging start-ups has been the use of machine learning algorithms to gain an analytical edge in trading. What tends to vary is the proposed clientele. For example, start-ups like Binatix are aimed more at large data sets and analytics for portfolio and hedge fund management on a wider scale; whereas Williamsburg based Inovance, is attempting to bring machine learning based trading analytics to the rescue of common investors. Similarly, earlier this year, Alpaca (deep learning Fintech start-up) launched Capitalico; a deep learning trading platform, that allows traders to automate their trade ideas without any programming or market investing experience.  This theme runs throughout the evolution of finance, banking is becoming ever-more personalised. Smart wallets like Wallet.ai will help you consider, analyse, price, and consider every single thing you purchase, in a way that no bank, financial advisor or human assistant could begin to attempt. Following many years of having “offshored” repetitive tasks to lower-cost locations, PWC have predicted that this financial revolution will lead to “reshoring” and localisation of banking again thanks to the falling costs of automation and AI innovation.  AI analytics can be applied across the entire financial world, the next level of disruption has arrived, and it spells the end for banking as we know it. In the coming years we will see deep learning infiltrate identity authentication, portfolio construction, automated investment, fraud detection, and transactional safety; not a stone will lay un-turned in the financial world. PWC has predicted that the next three to five years are likely to lay the foundations, with “modest, evolutionary gains”, followed by rapid expansion as the technology becomes cheaper, more widely available, and more accepted by the general populace. The partnership of deep learning and Fintech is still very young, who knows where it could take us?

Carel			https://www.casino.org/blog/how-money-laundering-really-works/	Money laundering is a very serious criminal activity.  Most people have heard of the term money laundering, but many would need a dictionary (or Wikipedia) to actually tell you what it meant.  Relative to how severe a crime it is, money laundering isn’t really that complicated, and is much more prevalent than you might think.  How Does Money Laundering Work? What Even Is It?  A criminal has just ‘inherited’ a large amount of money illegally. Simply depositing it into a personal or business account of his will assuredly raise suspicion at his bank. So would not claiming it on his taxes, something that might be difficult to explain to the authorities.  So, what does that criminal do with his dirty money? Clean it, of course.  Simply put: money laundering is taking illegally-obtained money and making it look like it was earned legally instead.  This is done by criminals through certain kinds of transactions, investments in assets, and other moves that hide the original source of the funds.  The end result is money that ‘looks’ legal and is able to be used without raising the suspicion of authorities.  The term allegedly came from notorious mobster Al Capone, who liked to hide his illegal profits as legitimate income in the many laundromats he owned.  Today the term is something of an umbrella term to describe many different methods of deceiving the law about where money came from.  Laundering is a big problem.  In the United States alone, an estimated $300 billion is laundered annually through banks and similar institutions, which accounts for 2% of the country’s entire economy.  Globally, estimates go as high as $2 trillion, or as much as 5% of the world’s GDP.  The advent of digital banking and cash management has made moving money quickly and covertly easier than ever by criminals, making laundering one of the biggest crimes of our time. And with the rise of online gambling, there has been a huge increase in money laundering through online casinos.  The Three Steps of Laundering  Even though the practice has been around for centuries and has gotten increasingly complex, there are still just three basic steps that criminals employ to launder money: placement, layering and integration.  Once dirty money is obtained by criminals, placement is the first step.  This involves putting the funds into a bank account registered to a business (real or otherwise) or to a middleman.  This step is where most would-be launderers get caught, as putting large amounts of money into these accounts out of nowhere generally looks suspicious if not done carefully.  Next the money needs to be layered, or exchanged through multiple transactions so that its original source can’t be traced.  There’s many ways that criminals tend to do this, including dispersing the funds to many different bank accounts or buying expensive assets like houses or cars.  Finally, the launderer seeks to get their now-clean money back through integration.  More transactions are made that re-direct the money back to the criminal. Sometimes this may take the form of a salary as head of a newly created business or nonprofit. Other times it may be invested in legitimate businesses, complete with fake invoices attempting to show the money was genuine income.  Ways Criminals Do It  While the basic three steps don’t vary that much, there’s a huge variety of ways criminals go about laundering their money.  Structuring: During the placement step, the money is broken down into several smaller deposits in order to better avoid detection.  Often this is done by way of purchasing securities like money orders that are then re-deposited again in small quantities.  Casinos and Gambling: The dirty money is converted into chips at a casino, played with for a short while, then cashed out in the form of a check.  Sometimes this is also done through fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as players play and lose a little bit, then cash out so they have a receipt to show as proof of their ‘winnings’.  Round-Tripping: Money is placed into the account of a foreign business, then received back as a tax-exempt foreign direct investment.  It can also be when two companies agree between one another to sell and then buy back an asset at the same price. Sometimes this is called a ‘lazy susan’.  Cash-Intensive Businesses: Criminal businesses that tend to receive large influxes of cash sneak in illegal money into their accounts, mixing it in with legally earned money.  Common businesses used for this method are strip clubs, casinos, and car washes (as Pacino did and also Walt and Skyler in Breaking Bad).  There are many other ways of laundering, and it’s a practice that’s constantly evolving especially as financial transactions shift to being more digitally-based.  Detection and Punishment  In most western nations, laundering money wasn’t actually a crime until the 1980s and 1990s.  Before that, governments were more likely to pin criminals with a similar crime (like tax evasion) if they were suspicious of large amounts of crime-created money being moved.  Prevention measures in many countries require all transactions over a specified amount ($10,000 in the U.S.) to be reported by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and similar.  Laws also require that banking institutions take actions to confirm the real identity of their customers and businesses. Should a transaction seem unordinary for that particular person, a suspicious activity report is often filed.  These reports usually go to a financial crimes agency or task force that analyzes the data to determine if investigative action should be taken.  Many anti-laundering recommendations are also put forth by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an international organization devoted to stopping laundering.  Punishments for laundering also vary wildly by country, especially since it’s often done in conjunction with another crime (like tax evasion and whatever was done to originally obtain the dirty money).  In the United States, cases that strictly involve just laundering are punishable by a maximum of 14 years in prison.  For financial institutions, even just neglecting to report activity that might be laundering can carry up to five years.  The Future of Laundering  Some of the proclaimed benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are that transactions are anonymous and not controlled or regulated by any central organization.  However, these strengths are also weaknesses in that criminals can more easily launder money via the digital currencies, which is why governments are working quickly to pass cryptocurrency regulation.  Many countries like China, Russia, Canada, and others have already passed or proposed anti-laundering laws pertaining to digital money.  As cryptocurrencies see an uptick in popularity and usage, it will be interesting to see how governments attempt to stop criminals from using them to launder money.  Somewhat ironically, the person who actually figures out how to do that will likely make a lot money.  The contents of this blog are provided as an information guide only and do not amount to legal advice. The blog seeks to raise awareness of, and educate the public on, money laundering issues in order to shine the spotlight on and prevent this criminal activity.  So.. the next time someone asks you: “How does money laundering work?” You’ll be able to tell them it’s not as complicated as they might think!

Other times it may be invested in legitimate businesses, complete with fake invoices attempting to show the money was genuine income.\n\nWays Criminals Do It\n\nWhile the basic three steps don’t vary that much, there’s a huge variety of ways criminals go about laundering their money.\n\nStructuring: During the placement step, the money is broken down into several smaller deposits in order to better avoid detection.\n\nOften this is done by way of purchasing securities like money orders that are then re-deposited again in small quantities.\n\nCasinos and Gambling: The dirty money is converted into chips at a casino, played with for a short while, then cashed out in the form of a check.\n\nSometimes this is also done through fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as players play and lose a little bit, then cash out so they have a receipt to show as proof of their ‘winnings’.\n\nRound-Tripping: Money is placed into the account of a foreign business, then received back as a tax-exempt foreign direct investment.\n\nIt can also be when two companies agree between one another to sell and then buy back an asset at the same price. Sometimes this is called a ‘lazy susan’.\n\nCash-Intensive Businesses: Criminal businesses that tend to receive large influxes of cash sneak in illegal money into their accounts, mixing it in with legally earned money.\n\nCommon businesses used for this method are strip clubs, casinos, and car washes (as Pacino did and also Walt and Skyler in Breaking Bad).\n\nThere are many other ways of laundering, and it’s a practice that’s constantly evolving especially as financial transactions shift to being more digitally-based.\n\nDetection and Punishment\n\nIn most western nations, laundering money wasn’t actually a crime until the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBefore that, governments were more likely to pin criminals with a similar crime (like tax evasion) if they were suspicious of large amounts of crime-created money being moved.\n\nPrevention measures in many countries require all transactions over a specified amount ($10,000 in the U.S.) to be reported by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and similar.\n\nLaws also require that banking institutions take actions to confirm the real identity of their customers and businesses. Should a transaction seem unordinary for that particular person, a suspicious activity report is often filed.\n\nThese reports usually go to a financial crimes agency or task force that analyzes the data to determine if investigative action should be taken.\n\nMany anti-laundering recommendations are also put forth by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an international organization devoted to stopping laundering.\n\nPunishments for laundering also vary wildly by country, especially since it’s often done in conjunction with another crime (like tax evasion and whatever was done to originally obtain the dirty money).\n\nIn the United States, cases that strictly involve just laundering are punishable by a maximum of 14 years in prison.\n\nFor financial institutions, even just neglecting to report activity that might be laundering can carry up to five years.\n\nThe Future of Laundering\n\nSome of the proclaimed benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are that transactions are anonymous and not controlled or regulated by any central organization.\n\nHowever, these strengths are also weaknesses in that criminals can more easily launder money via the digital currencies, which is why governments are working quickly to pass cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nMany countries like China, Russia, Canada, and others have already passed or proposed anti-laundering laws pertaining to digital money.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies see an uptick in popularity and usage, it will be interesting to see how governments attempt to stop criminals from using them to launder money.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the person who actually figures out how to do that will likely make a lot money.\n\nThe contents of this blog are provided as an information guide only and do not amount to legal advice. The blog seeks to raise awareness of, and educate the public on, money laundering issues in order to shine the spotlight on and prevent this criminal activity.\n\nSo.. the next time someone asks you: “How does money laundering work?” You’ll be able to tell them it’s not as complicated as they might think!', 'authorsList': ['Kevin Horridge'], 'description': "Money laundering is something that is commonly used in TV shows and movies, but it's extremely prevalent in the real world.

And with the rise of online gambling, there has been a huge increase in <a href="https://www.casino.org/blog/money-laundering-in-online-casinos/">money laundering through online casinos</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Three Steps of Laundering</h2>\n\n<p>Even though the practice has been around for centuries and has gotten increasingly complex, there are still just three basic steps that criminals employ to launder money: placement, layering and integration.</p>\n\n<figure><img src="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme.jpg" alt="A typical example of a Money Laundering Scheme" srcset="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme.jpg 546w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme-148x90.jpg 148w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme-80x50.jpg 80w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme-90x55.jpg 90w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Money-Laundering-Scheme-150x91.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"><figcaption>Image Credit: people.exeter.ac.uk</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Once dirty money is obtained by criminals, <strong>placement </strong>is the first step.</p>\n\n<p>This involves putting the funds into a bank account registered to a business (real or otherwise) or to a middleman.</p>\n\n<p>This step is where most would-be launderers get caught, as putting large amounts of money into these accounts out of nowhere generally looks suspicious if not done carefully.</p>\n\n<p>Next the money needs to be <strong>layered</strong>, or exchanged through multiple transactions so that its original source can’t be traced.</p>\n\n<p>There’s many ways that criminals tend to do this, including dispersing the funds to many different bank accounts or buying expensive assets like houses or cars.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the launderer seeks to get their now-clean money back through <strong>integration</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>More transactions are made that re-direct the money back to the criminal. Sometimes this may take the form of a salary as head of a newly created business or nonprofit. Other times it may be invested in legitimate businesses, complete with fake invoices attempting to show the money was genuine income.</p>\n\n<h2>Ways Criminals Do It</h2>\n\n<figure><img src="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad.jpg" alt="Characters from Breaking Bad with piles of money" srcset="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad.jpg 850w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-148x98.jpg 148w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-83x55.jpg 83w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-418x277.jpg 418w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-190x125.jpg 190w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Breaking-Bad-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"><figcaption>Image Credit: spiegel.de</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>While the basic three steps don’t vary that much, there’s a huge <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/money-laundering2.htm">variety of ways</a> criminals go about laundering their money.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structuring: </strong>During the placement step, the money is broken down into several smaller deposits in order to better avoid detection.</p>\n\n<p>Often this is done by way of purchasing securities like money orders that are then re-deposited again in small quantities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Casinos and Gambling: </strong>The dirty money is converted into chips at a casino, played with for a short while, then cashed out in the form of a check.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes this is also done through fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as players play and lose a little bit, then cash out so they have a receipt to show as proof of their ‘winnings’.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Round-Tripping: </strong>Money is placed into the account of a foreign business, then received back as a tax-exempt foreign direct investment.</p>\n\n<p>It can also be when two companies agree between one another to sell and then buy back an asset at the same price. Sometimes this is called a ‘lazy susan’.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cash-Intensive Businesses: Criminal </strong>businesses that tend to receive large influxes of cash sneak in illegal money into their accounts, mixing it in with legally earned money.</p>\n\n<p>Common businesses\xa0 used for this method are strip clubs, casinos, and car washes (as Pacino did and also Walt and Skyler in <em>Breaking Bad</em>).</p>\n\n<p>There are many other ways of laundering, and it’s a practice that’s constantly evolving especially as financial transactions shift to being more digitally-based.</p>\n\n<h2>Detection and Punishment</h2>\n\n<p>In most western nations, laundering money wasn’t actually a crime until the 1980s and 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>Before that, governments were more likely to pin criminals with a similar crime (like tax evasion) if they were suspicious of large amounts of crime-created money being moved.</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://www.casino.org/assets/media/images/common/transparent_3x2.gif" data-src="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1024x683.jpg" alt="close up of laundered money " data-srcset="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-148x99.jpg 148w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-83x55.jpg 83w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-418x277.jpg 418w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px">\n                                <img src="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1024x683.jpg" alt="close up of laundered money " srcset="https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-148x99.jpg 148w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-83x55.jpg 83w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-418x277.jpg 418w, https://www.casino.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Header-Image-Money-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"></p>\n\n<p>Prevention measures in many countries require all transactions over a specified amount ($10,000 in the U.S.) to be reported\xa0 by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and similar.</p>\n\n<p>Laws also require that banking institutions take actions to confirm the real identity of their customers and businesses.

Carel	Daniel Altman	Individual	https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-ranked-best-for-investment/article7359257.ece	A ranking of destinations for attractiveness to foreign investors has placed India at the top among 110 countries. China has secured the 65th position and the U.S. is at the 50th. In the 2014 index, India was at the sixth position and Hong Kong was number one.  The ranking is based on an index for baseline profitability that assumes that three factors affect the ultimate success of a foreign investment: how much the value of an asset grows; the preservation of that value while the asset is owned; and the ease of repatriation of proceeds from selling the asset. The index combines measures for each of these factors into a summary statistic that conveys a country’s basic attractiveness for investment.  Investment guidance “Where exactly should they [investors] put their money? The Baseline Profitability Index (BPI) is back for its third year with some answers, and Narendra Modi’s India is the place to start,” wrote Daniel Altman, creator of the index and an Adjunct Professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, in the Foreign Policy magazine.  “...economic growth alone doesn’t determine the returns to investing abroad; you have to worry about things like financial stability, physical security, corruption, expropriation by government, exploitation by local partners, capital controls, and exchange rates as well. Putting all of these factors together gives a better idea of how big the return will be when it finally reaches your pocket,” he wrote.  The big story in the BPI in 2015 is “India coming out on top, with growth forecasts up, perceptions of corruption down, and investors better protected following the election of a government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”  High returns A high ranking indicates high returns and improving economic institutions. The index, thus, compares how local policies and conditions affect the same investment in different countries. Or how the value of the principal and the return will change depending only on where the investment is made.  Local factors can erode profits. These include payment of bribes and kickbacks, the risk of which is compared across countries using the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, a measure for the perceived levels of public-sector corruption worldwide. In 2014, the country was at the 85th position out of 175 countries as compared to its ranking of 94 out of 177 in 2013.  World Bank index BPI calculation also uses an index of investor protection compiled by the World Bank. In 2014, the average BPI score across all countries was 0.99; this year it is 1.03 — meaning the expected returns over the next five years are about three-quarters of a per cent higher a year.  The calculation of the BPI is an imperfect exercise fraught with assumptions, Mr. Altman says.  “For example, how does a survey about perceptions of corruption translate into likelihoods of having to pay bribes, and how big might those bribes be?” he wrote when he first introduced the index.

Shakshi	Uhuru Kenyatta	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhuru_Kenyatta	Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta (born 26 October 1961) is a Kenyan politician, and current President of the Republic of Kenya. [1] He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gatundu South from 2002 to 2013. Currently, he is a member and the party leader of the Jubilee Party of Kenya. Uhuru was previously associated with the Kenya Africa National Union before joining The National Alliance, one of the allied parties that campaigned for his reelection during the 2017 general elections.  He is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first President, and his fourth wife Mama Ngina Kenyatta. [2] He is married to his wife Margaret Gakuo Kenyatta since 1991 and together they have three children namely; Jomo, Jaba and Ngina. Uhuru was re-elected for a second term in the August 2017 general election, winning 54% of the popular vote. [3] [4] The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Wafula Chebukati. [5] [6] However, Uhuru's election was successfully challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling. A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39% participation.  Early life[ edit ]  Uhuru is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's founding father and the first president of the republic of Kenya (in office 1964–1978), with his fourth wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta. His family hails from the Kikuyu, a Bantu ethnic group. His given name " Uhuru" is from the Swahili term for "freedom", and was given to him in anticipation of Kenya's upcoming independence. Uhuru attended St Mary's School in Nairobi. Between 1979 and 1980, he also briefly worked as a teller at the Kenya Commercial Bank. [7]  After St. Mary's school, Uhuru went on to study economics, political science and government at Amherst College in the United States. [8] [9] [2] Upon his graduation, Uhuru returned to Kenya, and started a company Wilham Kenya Limited, through which he sourced and exported agricultural produce. [10]  Uhuru was nominated to Parliament in 2001, he became Minister for Local Government under President Daniel Arap Moi and, despite his political inexperience, was favoured by Moi as his successor. [11] Kenyatta ran as KANU's candidate in the December 2002 presidential election, but lost to the opposition candidate Mwai Kibaki by a big margin. [12] He subsequently became Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. He backed Kibaki for re-election in the December 2007 presidential election and was named Minister of Local Government by Kibaki in January 2008, before becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade in April 2008 as part of a coalition government. [13]  Subsequently, Kenyatta was Minister of Finance from 2009 to 2012, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. Accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of committing crimes against humanity in relation to the violent aftermath of the 2007 election, he resigned as Minister of Finance on 26 January 2012. [14] He was elected as President of Kenya in the March 2013 presidential election, defeating Raila Odinga with a slim majority in a single round of voting.  In the 1997 general election, Uhuru Kenyatta contested the Gatundu South Constituency parliamentary seat, once held by his father, but lost to Moses Mwihia, a Nairobi architect. [15]  In 1999, Moi appointed Uhuru to chair the Kenya Tourism Board, a government parastatal. In 2001, he was nominated as a Member of Parliament, and he joined the Cabinet as Minister for Local Government. [16] He would also later be elected First Vice Chairman of KANU. [16]  In the nomination process in 2002 in what was widely thought as undemocratic and underhand, Moi influenced Uhuru Kenyatta's nomination as KANU 's preferred presidential candidate, sparking an outcry from other interested contenders and a massive exit from the party. This move by Moi was seen as a ploy to install Uhuru as a puppet so that even in retirement, Moi would still rule the country through Uhuru and presumably insulate himself against charges of abuse of office that plagued his presidency.  Uhuru finished second to Mwai Kibaki in the General Elections, with 31% of the vote. [17] [18] He conceded defeat and took up an active leadership role as Leader of the Opposition. [15]  In January 2005, Uhuru Kenyatta defeated Nicholas Biwott for chairmanship of KANU, taking 2,980 votes among party delegates against Biwott's 622 votes. [19]  Uhuru led his party KANU in the referendum campaigns against the draft constitution in 2005, having teamed up with the Liberal Democratic Party, a rebel faction in the Kibaki government, to form the Orange Democratic Movement. The result of this was a vote against the adoption of the draft constitution by a noticeable margin, which was a great political embarrassment to Emilio Mwai Kibaki.  In November 2006, Kenyatta was displaced as KANU leader by Biwott. [20] [21] On 28 December 2006, the High Court of Kenya reinstated Uhuru Kenyatta as KANU chairman. However, further court proceedings followed. [22] On 28 June 2007, the High Court confirmed Kenyatta as party leader, ruling that there was insufficient evidence for Biwott's argument that Kenyatta had joined another party. [23]  In the run up to the 2007 general election, he led KANU to join a coalition (called Party of National Unity"PNU") with President Mwai Kibaki who was running for a second term against Raila Odinga. [24] PNU won the controversial 2007 elections but the dispute over the poll resulted in the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis. [25] [26] Under an agreement between the two parties to end the chaos, Kibaki remained as president in a power sharing agreement with Raila as Prime Minister, while Uhuru Kenyatta was Kibaki's choice as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister For Finance in his share of Cabinet slots. [16] [27]  ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo charged Uhuru, who was a PNU leader, as an indirect co-perpetrator in the violence that followed the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis, and the charges were confirmed on 23 January 2012. [28] The Prosecutor also charged William Ruto who had been a supporter of ODM, rivals of the PNU in the 2007 election. [29] Uhuru resigned as Minister of Finance upon the confirmation of the charges but maintained his innocence. [30] The charges were dropped on 13 March 2015 for lack of evidence. [31]  On 13 September 2007, Uhuru Kenyatta withdrew from the December 2007 presidential election in favour of Kibaki for re-election. [32] He said that he did not want to run unless he could be sure of winning. [33]  Following the election, amidst the controversy that resulted when Kibaki was declared the victor despite claims of fraud from challenger Raila Odinga and his Orange Democratic Movement, Kibaki appointed Kenyatta as Minister for Local Government on 8 January 2008. [34] After Kibaki and Odinga reached a power-sharing agreement, Kenyatta was named Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade on 13 April 2008, as part of the Grand Coalition Cabinet. He was the Deputy Prime Minister representing the PNU, while another Deputy Prime Minister, Musalia Mudavadi, represented the ODM. [35] [36] [37]  Kenyatta and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in on 17 April. [38] [39] Uhuru Kenyatta was later moved from Local Government and appointed Minister for Finance on 23 January 2009. [40] During his tenure, he spearheaded a number of reform measures that changed how treasury and government by extension transact business, such as the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and a fund for the inclusion of the informal sector in the mainstream economy.  In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was elected as the 4th and current president of Kenya under The National Alliance (TNA), which was part of the Jubilee Alliance with his running mate William Ruto 's United Republican Party (URP). [41] Uhuru and Ruto won 50.07% of votes cast, with closest rivals, Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy garnering 42%. [42] Raila Amolo Odinga disputed the election results at the Supreme Court which however held (7–0) that the election of Uhuru was valid and such irregularities as existed did not make a difference to the final outcome. [1] Uhuru Kenyatta was therefore sworn in as president on 9 April 2013. [43]  Uhuru ran for president in the elections held on 4 March 2013 and garnered 6,173,433 votes (50.03%) out of the 12,338,667 votes cast. As this was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold, he won the election in the first round thus evading a run-off between the top two candidates. [44] He was, therefore, declared the fourth President of the Republic of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).  According to the IEBC, Raila Odinga garnered 5,340,546 votes (43.4%) and was thus the second in the field of eight candidates. CORD, under the leadership of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, lodged a petition with the Supreme Court of Kenya on 10 March 2013 challenging Uhuru's election. [45] On 30 March 2013, Dr Willy Mutunga, the Chief Justice of Kenya, read the unanimous Supreme Court ruling declaring the election of Uhuru Kenyatta and his running-mate, William Ruto, as valid. [46] On 11 August 2017, the Chairman of the IEBC, Wafula Chebukati announced Uhuru's reelection to a second term in office during the 2017 Kenyan general election, with 54% of the popular vote. [3] [4] This was later contested in court and annulled. In the events that followed the annulment, Kenyatta was seen as lacking direction and being a reactionary leader. [ citation needed ] Following this annulment, a second election was required in which Uhuru Kenyatta won with 98% of the vote with a 39% voter turnout. [47]  On 9 March 2018 Uhuru Kenyatta agreed on a truce between the opposition leader, Raila Odinga. [48] This action marked the country's watershed moment that redrew its political architecture. [49] On 27 November 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) in Bomas of Kenya. [50] This is one of the results between him and the opposition leader Raila Odinga as its implementations will foresee some amendments in the Kenyan Constitution. [51]  Although it has been claimed that Uhuru was one of the few ministers who had no scandals attached to their name, [52] on 29 April 2009, he faced a controversial scare after he presented a supplemental budget that was inadvertently approved by the parliament. The budget was aimed to bridge the budgetary gap that had arisen due to slow economic growth. The government required an additional Kshs 38 billion, but compromised on a figure of Kshs 22 billion and non-essential proposed expenditure was postponed as a result. After voting on the bill brought forward by Kenyatta, Gitobu Imanyara raised discrepancy questions as to what exactly had been approved by the house. It appeared that the parliament had approved a budget of Kshs 31 billion as opposed to Kshs 22 billion that they thought they were voting on – a difference of Kshs 9.2 billion. The Deputy Prime Minister initially defended the approval but later admitted that there were computer or typographical errors in the budget bill. Amid the raging debate about the contentious issue, the Speaker ordered the CID and a parliamentary committee to question him on the discrepancies. [53] He was later cleared of any wrongdoing by the Joint Finance and Budgetary Committee. [54]  ICC charges related to 2007–08 post-election violence[ edit ]  On 15 December 2010, prior to him becoming president, Kenyatta was named as a suspect of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, for planning and funding violence in Naivasha and Nakuru. [55] This was in relation to the violence that followed the bungled national elections of December 2007. In furtherance of his political support for Kibaki's PNU at the time, he was accused of organising a Kikuyu politico-religious group, the Mungiki, in the post-election violence. Overall, the post-election violence of 2007 is said to have claimed about 1300 lives. Uhuru maintained his innocence and wanted his name cleared. On 8 March 2011, while serving as minister in Kibaki's government, he was indicted after being summoned to appear before the ICC pre-trial chamber. He was to appear at The Hague on 8 April 2011 alongside five other suspects. [56] On 29 September 2011, while seeking to exonerate himself, Uhuru Kenyatta put up a spirited fight as he was being cross-examined by ICC Chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo in The Hague, denying any links with the outlawed Mungiki sect. He said Prime Minister Raila Odinga should take political responsibility for the acts of violence and killings that followed the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya. He told the three judges that "by telling his supporters election results were being rigged, fanned tensions and then failed to use his influence to quell the violence that followed the announcement of the 2007 presidential results."  Though Uhuru had previously dismissed ICC summons, [57] he changed his decision along the way. Together with his two other co-accused suspects, Head of Civil Service, Ambassador Francis Muthaura and former Police Commissioner Hussein Ali, the trio honoured the ICC Summons that sought to determine whether their cases met the set standards for international trials. [58] On 23 January 2012, the ICC confirmed the cases against Kenyatta and Muthaura although the charges against Muthaura were subsequently dropped. [59] Serious concerns about the case have been raised, particularly the nature of the evidence being used against Kenyatta. There are also serious concerns about witness tampering and indeed, a number of witnesses have disappeared or died, [60] which is the reason cited by the ICC for dropping charges against Mathaura. [61] On a 12 October 2013 speech to the African Union in which he set a belligerent tone, Uhuru accused the ICC of being "a toy of declining imperial powers". [62]  On 31 October 2013, the ICC postponed Kenyatta's trial for crimes against humanity by three months until 5 February 2014 after the defense had requested more time. [63]  On 8 October 2014, Kenyatta appeared before the ICC in The Hague. He was called to appear at the ICC "status conference" when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld. In a speech to the Kenyan parliament Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity — not as president of the country — so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans. Kenyatta did not speak in court, but denied the charges in comments to journalists as he left the court to catch a flight back home. "We as Kenyans, we know where we came from, we know where we are going, and nobody will tell us what to do," he said. The judges adjourned the hearings and charges were dropped on 13 March 2015. [64] [65] [66]  The National Alliance Party (TNA)[ edit ]  On 20 May 2012, Uhuru Kenyatta attended the elaborately assembled and much-publicized launch of The National Alliance party in a modern high-tech dome at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. His presence at the TNA launch was a strong indication that he would contest for the party's presidential nomination ticket in his quest for the presidency in the 2013 General Elections.  The Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Eugene Wamalwa and Eldoret North Constituency MP William Ruto led more than 70 MPs in attending the function. The Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly, Abdi Ramadhan, Cabinet Ministers Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Jamleck Irungu Kamau, Dr. Naomi Shaaban, Samuel Poghisio, Professor Sam Ongeri and Dr. Mohammed Kuti and MPs Charles Cheruiyot Keter, Aden Bare Duale and Mohamed Maalim Mohamud also attended the event.  Speeches at the launch revolved around the need for a thriving economy, the need for the rights of people of all classes in society to be championed, the need for peaceful co-existence, the need for visionary and committed leadership, the need for transformative leadership, the need for a youthful crop of committed professionals in leadership, the need for free and fair nomination and election processes in the General Election, the need for an economically empowered youth and a call to bring an end to divisive and sectarian interests in politics to safeguard Kenya from sliding to dictatorship. [67] Machel Waikenda was the director of communications and secretary of arts and entertainment of the National Alliance, from April 2012 to August 2013 and he led the media and communications department of the party during the 2013 elections. [68]  By-elections (17 September 2012)[ edit ]  On 17 September 2012, The National Alliance party had its first real test when it contested various civic and parliamentary positions in a by-election that covered 17 seats in total; 3 parliamentary and 14 civic. Overall, 133,054 votes were cast in the by-elections and TNA led the pack after it garnered 38.89% or 51,878 votes, followed by Orange Democratic Movement with 33.7% or 44,837 votes, Party of National Unity with 4.46% or 5,929 votes, Wiper Democratic Movement with 4.44% or 5,912 votes and United Democratic Forum with 4.15% or 5,520 votes.  TNA won civic and parliamentary seats in 7 different counties while its closest challengers, ODM won seats in 4 counties. [69] The National Alliance Party remained a strong contender for the following year's general elections, having received major defections from other big political parties of Kenya. The successful election of TNA's main candidates (Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto) continued to enhance TNA's viability.  In January 2015, however, TNA merged with URP to form the Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP).  Uhuru Kenyatta's party, The National Alliance (TNA) joined William Ruto 's United Republican Party (URP), Najib Balala's Republican Congress Party (RCP) and Charity Ngilu's National Rainbow Coalition party to form the Jubilee Alliance coalition. Various opinion polls prior to the election placed Uhuru as one of the main contenders, and his Jubilee Alliance as among the most popular. The other formidable coalition was the Coalition For Reform and Democracy (CORD), led by Raila Odinga.  In undercover video footage, released in a BBC news report on 19 March 2018, [70] the managing director of Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked to elect Donald Trump in the 2016 American presidential election, boasted that his firm had run successful presidential election campaigns in Kenya in 2013 and 2017, though he did not name Kenyatta explicitly. "We have re-branded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging," Turnbull said, of the campaigns that his company managed in Kenya. "I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing—so just about every element of this candidate." [71] A Jubilee Party vice president admitted on 20 March 2018, that the party had hired an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica for "branding" in the 2017 election. [72]  Uhuru Kenyatta was officially declared the president elect on Saturday 9 March at 2:44 pm. [73] [74] [75] [76]  As per the IEBC's official results, Uhuru got 6,173,433 of the 12,221,053 valid votes cast ahead of the second placed Raila Odinga who garnered 5,340,546 (43.7%). Uhuru's result was 50.51% of the vote and was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold set out in the 2010 constitution, thus making him the president-elect. [77]  Results dispute[ edit ]  Main article: The Kenya Presidential Election Petition 2013  There was some discontent with the official results, as would be expected in such a hotly contested election, especially in Raila Odinga's strongholds. The inordinate delay [78] in releasing the results and the technical failure of some safeguards and election equipment deployed by the IEBC did not help the perception that the election had been less than free and fair. [79]  Further, an exit poll conducted by UCSD Professor Clark Gibson and James Long, Asst. Prof. and University of Washington suggested that neither Odinga nor Kenyatta had attained the 50% plus one vote threshold. [80] Analysts [ who? ] have contended that even though elections for five other levels were held in Kenya at the same time, their national turnout levels and total vote tallies were about 16% less than the presidential total; e.g. while 10.6 million voters elected candidates for member of the National Assembly, the Senate and the 47 gubernatorial seats, almost 2 million more voted in the presidential election. This has fueled concern and speculations of vote manipulation in President Kenyatta's favor. [81]  Two groups disputed these results and filed petitions challenging various aspects of it at the Supreme Court of Kenya to contest the result. The groups were the Coalition For Reform and Democracy, CORD, led by Raila Odinga, and the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AFRICOG). Uhuru Kenyatta and his running mate were respondents in these cases and were represented by Fred Ngatia and Katwa Kigen respectively. [82]  Supreme Court ruling[ edit ]  The Supreme court judges unanimously upheld the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as Kenya's fourth president after rejecting Raila Odinga's petition in a verdict delivered on Saturday 30 March 2013. Chief Justice Willy Mutunga in his ruling said the elections were indeed conducted in compliance with the Constitution and the law. [83]  Presidential swearing-in at kasarani[ edit ]  After the Supreme Court dismissed the petitions the swearing in ceremony was held on 9 April 2013 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Nairobi, in accordance to Article 141 (2) (b) of the constitution which stipulates that in case the Supreme Court upholds the victory of the president-elect, the swearing in will take place on "the first Tuesday following the seventh day following the date on which the court renders a decision declaring the election to be valid". [84]  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia to discuss the situation in South Sudan at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., on 5 August 2014  Presidential Standard of Uhuru Kenyatta  This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2017)  During his inaugural speech, Uhuru promised economic transformation through Vision 2030, unity among all Kenyans, free maternal care and that he will serve all Kenyans. He also promised to improve the standards of education in Kenya. During the Madaraka day Celebrations, a national holiday celebrated to the country's independence on 1 June, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced free maternal care in all public health facilities, a move that was welcomed by many Kenyans. [85] [86] [87]  On 1 September 2017, the Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the re-election of Uhuru Kenyatta after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had announced him the winner on 8 August 2017. [88] As a result of that, there was a need for the election to be held once again. It was scheduled for 26 October 2017. After the reelection, Uhuru Kenyatta emerged the winner once again.  He was sworn in on 28 November 2017 for his second presidential term. [89]  Challenges[ edit ]  His major challenges include the high cost of living, rising public debt, a high public wage bill and allegations of corruption among people close to his government. [90] The 2017 general election and its violence is also a challenge that threatened not only his presidency but also the future of the East African Nation  Public Wage Bill[ edit ]  The high public wage cost has been a headache to Uhuru's administration. [91] At the start of his term, the President decried the high wage bill which was at 12% of GDP (as against a recommended 7%). [92] In 2015, the President stated that the wage bill was at 50% of the total annual revenue collection of government. [93] In an attempt to curtail it, the President announced a pay cut for himself and his Cabinet in March 2014, reducing his salary by 20%. [94] It was hoped that the high earners in government would follow suit but this did not materialize. [95] Another measure was the newly created constitutional Salaries and Remuneration Commission which it was hoped would regularize salaries but it has faced an up hill battle against Members of Parliament, who wish to protect their earnings and labor unions. [96] [97] The President thereafter ordered an audit of the government payroll so as to flush out ghost workers. [98] The audit identified 12,000 ghost workers. [99] In the meantime, lower cadre government workers have demanded pay rises, more so by teachers and health workers, who have gone on strikes at various times to demand the increase. [100] [101] The strikes in the health sector mainly affect the counties, Kenya's other level of government, as it is managed by the devolved units. [102]  Foreign relations[ edit ]  U.S. President Donald Trump with President Kenyatta in Washington, D.C., on 27 August 2018  The President's foreign relations had been dominated by the ICC question. [103] His relations with the West were expected to be cold, more so after the West warned Kenyans not to elect him as president. [104] The United Kingdom promised to have only essential contacts with him if he were elected. [105] However, his relationship with the West has thawed significantly and he has participated in the US — Africa summit [106] as well as a Somalia summit in the United Kingdom. [107] The ICC has accused his government of frustrating its investigation efforts into the case, [108] although it has absolved the President personally of any involvement in the frustration. [109]  His activities have however been more robust at the African level where he has pushed more intra-Africa trade and economic independence of African nations. [110] In November 2014, he launched consultations to reform the United Nations Security Council to expand the voice of Africa in the council. [111] He has successfully rallied the AU against the ICC culminating in an Extraordinary Summit of the African Heads of State which resolved that sitting African Heads of State should not appear before the ICC. [112] The AU further asked the Security Council to suspend his trial at the ICC; for the first time ever, the Security Council resolution was defeated by abstention with 9 members of the Council abstaining rather than voting against so as not to offend Kenyatta. [113] The Assembly of State Parties of the ICC would two days later amend the ICC statute to allow for one to appear by video link, a proposal President Kenyatta had made when he was Deputy Prime Minister. [114]  President Kenyatta has led and negotiated peace agreements in the South Sudan [115] and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. [116] At the East African level, he has developed a close relationship with the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda President Paul Kagame, creating the Coalition of the Willing, a caucus within the EAC [117] that has signed on to more joint development and economic agreements than the other EAC partners, including a joint tourist visa.  He attended the funeral of Nelson Mandela and was received warmly by the crowds. [118] He also attended the funeral of President Michael Sata of Zambia in November 2014. However, it had been perceived that his administration's relations with Botswana were strained due to Botswana's support of the ICC process. He has since visited Botswana to remove this perception and Botswana voted in favor of the AU's ICC Resolution. [119]  As expected, he has remained close to China which is funding most of his infrastructure projects. [120]  Further information: List of presidential trips made by Uhuru Kenyatta  In November 2015, it was noted that he was the most traveled Kenyan president compared to his predecessors. One of the leading national newspapers noted that Uhuru Kenyatta had been out of the country 43 times as of November 2015 [121] in a period of about three years since he took office in 2013, as compared to 33 times over a span of 10 years by his predecessor Mwai Kibaki. [122] The president's strategic communications unit [123] came out in defense of these trips stating that these trips had yielded more than what it cost the taxpayers to finance them. [124]  Approval ratings[ edit ]  His government's first year in office received low ratings from the general public. This is after a poll by Synovate indicated that more than half of the population was unhappy with how the government had conducted its affairs. The same polls also ranked the presidency as the second most trusted institution after the media. After his appearance at The Hague for his ICC case in October 2014, his poll ratings improved to 71%, according to a poll by Synovate. [125] [126] A poll by Gallup in August 2014 put his approval ratings at 78%, giving him the third best job approval ratings among African Presidents after Ian Khama of Botswana and Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta of Mali. [127] In 2015, due to allegations of corruption against some members of his government, his poll ratings dropped to his lowest rating yet at 33%, according to an Infotrack poll. [128] By February 2017, his poll numbers had, however, risen to 57%. [129] His poll numbers in 2018 would rise to 74% in light of a renewed effort to battle corruption.

Carel	Remote Control Project	Organization	https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35280402	Published  image copyrightGetty Images  Drones could be used by terrorist groups as "simple, affordable and effective airborne improvised explosive devices," says a report by London-based think tank the Remote Control Project.  The authors suggest manufacturers should program drones with the GPS coordinates of no-fly zones.  The British government should also relax regulations on radio frequency jammers, they add.  In addition, they advise tighter UK licensing regulation.  Currently in the UK, anyone can own and operate for non-commercial purposes a drone that weighs less than 20kg (3st 2lb) - and there are hundreds on the market.  "A range of terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate and activist threat groups have already demonstrated the ability to use civilian drones for attacks and intelligence gathering," the report reads.  "The best defence against the hostile use of drones is to employ a hierarchy of countermeasures encompassing regulatory countermeasures, passive countermeasures and active countermeasures."  It suggests that these could include:  limiting the payload capacity of commercial drones devising a security alert system when drones appear in no-fly zones the development of "innovative less-lethal anti-drone systems"  However, David Dunn, professor of International Politics, at Birmingham University, told the BBC that licensing may not deter terrorists.  "Law abiding citizens are likely to register, but it would be very difficult to stop terrorists and other criminals from purchasing drones abroad and then using them here," he said.  "Up until now it was expensive and required skill to be able to fly an aircraft - which acted as a form a regulation in itself.  "Now, you can fly these things relatively easily over people's heads."  The report also lists recent examples of suspicious activity involving drones:  Unidentified drones have been flown over various landmarks in France, including the US Embassy and the Eiffel Tower The Metropolitan Police recorded 20 suspicious drone-flying incidents around London between January 2013 and August 2015 So-called Islamic State has released videos showing drones being used for reconnaissance in Iraq  The authors of the report, members of a non-profit group called Open Briefing which describes itself as "the world's first civil society intelligence agency", admit that their suggested countermeasures are "not foolproof".  "The technology of remote control warfare is impossible to control," the report says.

Carel	Rohan Marley	Individual	http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090710/business/business2.html	, son of the late Bob Marley, working with a partner, has acquired lands in Jamaica for coffee farming and launched Marley Coffee, marrying his father's famous name to another world-class brand, Blue Mountain.  But while the company website advertises its product as organically certified "with the beans sourced from the highest Class One Specialty grade", the agency that regulates the coffee trade here says the Marley operation has not yet got its stamp of approval.  Stacian Bennett, legal representative at the Coffee Industry Board, confirmed however that the application from Marley was before the board.  Jamaica's Blue Mountain coffee is a premium bean, which is said to provide a cup of exceptional balance and an exotic and intense aroma.  Marley Coffee chief executive officer Shane Whittle on Thursday said the farm was 52 acres in size, employing six to eight people full-time.  Farm location  "We have started reaping," he said via email.  Whittle ignored the query on the farm's actual location.  But the company website gives the Bob Marley Museum on Hope Road in Kingston as the corporate address or place of contact for Marley Coffee.  The CIB's quality assurance manager, Hervine Willis, said that if Marley Coffee were in fact selling beans, it may not be Jamaican coffee and definitely was not Blue Mountain-grown.  "The coffee is not from here," said Willis.  "I went to the website and they have indicated using blends from Africa. They do have a farm and they were trying to license to sell the coffee, but they have not done what they need to do, including getting their dealer's licence."  The Blue Mountain label applies only to coffee grown in that location in the island.  The coffee board notes that licensed dealers are required to maintain a farm/production capacity of 6,000 boxes of cherry coffee per crop year.  "Anything going out of here as Blue Mountain coffee must be certified by this board. Whoever is buying Marley Coffee has no guarantee that it is Blue Mountain," said Willis on Thursday.  "The fact is they have not gotten any permission to market and they have not been processing Blue Mountain coffee."  Organic products are grown without artificial inputs such as chemical-based fertilisers, with the clear intent of tapping into another premium market where natural products, especially in Europe, attract a higher price.  Bennett said that for the CIB to certify coffee products as 'organic', the farm would need to be independently reviewed by "an appropriate and reputable organisation such as the Jamaica Organic Agri-culture Movement (JOAM)."  JOAM standards and certification committee head, Stacy Bennett, said Thursday that the organisation had not been approached to conduct such a review, but Whittle said the company was "in the process" of being certified by international body CERES.  Indeed, other local organic growers with whom the Financial Gleaner spoke note that they have received certification in several European countries, but none from the Coffee Industry Board.  The Blue Mountain brand  Whittle insisted that the Financial Gleaner view a video clip called 'One Cup of Coffee', saying it had full details of the farm - and had initially made it a condition of answering questions emailed to him about Marley Coffee - but the film on the company's website proved difficult to launch.  The Blue Mountain brand is also one of the most expensive to produce, at average rates of about US$7 per pound.  In 2008, Jamaica Blue Mountain and Jamaica High Mountain coffee brands, said to be the most expensive in the world, sold at base rates of US$11.50 per pound and US$7.50, respectively, and earned between US$28 million and US$50 million a year.  The 'Al' box of cherries sold for US$30 per pound and green beans for US$12 per pound.  Willis says most of the local coffee produced this year was exported green or in the raw state, with number one premium grade Blue Mountain now selling for US$33 per kilogramme. Sold as roasted coffee, the price is approximately US$44 per kilogramme. High Mountain fetches up to US$19.80 per kilogramme for raw beans and about US$25 per kilogramme for roasted.  Organic Blue Mountain attracts the highest prices local growers say, with the roasted selling this year for up to US$95 per kilogramme.  Supply of Blue Mountain coffee has fallen short in the past year or two due to the decimation of farms by past storms, and the inability of uninsured farmers to recapitalise their operations.  At the highest levels of production in the 2003/04 crop season, only 523,000 boxes of Blue Mountain and 90 boxes of High Mountain coffee were produced.

Shakshi	Arayik Harutyunyan	Individual	https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/armenian-separatist-leader-harutyunyan-seriously-wounded-after-azerbaijan-strike-on-bunker/news	Arayik Harutyunyan, the separatist leader of the so-called "Artsakh Republic," has been seriously injured after Azerbaijani military hit the bunker he was hiding in, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's aide Hikmet Hajiyev said in a statement after Armenia's attacks against the country's second-largest city Ganja.  "First of all, Arayik Harutyunyan, you are not at the forefront of the battle. You were hiding in a bunker. But Azerbaijani Armed Forces hit you in the bunker you were hiding in. After a missile strike, Arayik Harutyunyan has been seriously wounded," he said during a press conference.  "He was punished for the crimes committed against the city of Ganja and other civilian areas," he added.  "Other perpetrators, other war criminals will also be punished as soon as possible," Hajiyev said.  Harutyunyan is the so-called "president" of the proxy state set up by Armenia in illegally seized Azerbaijani territory. The area under separatist control is not recognized as a sovereign nation by any country on earth including Armenia, which fears such a move will stoke a fully-fledged war with Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said Sunday that one civilian has been killed and four others have been wounded in an Armenian missile attack on Ganja, as fighting intensified over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.  In statements posted on its website, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said Ganja, a city of more than 330,000 in the country's west, and several other civilian areas were under fire from rockets and shelling.  "Indiscriminate missile attacks are launched against Ganja, Füzuli, Tartar and Jabrayil cities of Azerbaijan from territory of Armenia. Ganja is the second biggest city of Azerbaijan. 500.000+ population," Hajiyev previously said in a tweet.  "Armenia as state and insane political-military leadership of Armenia remains source of imminent threat to regional peace, security. Azerbaijan will continue to defend its citizens," he added.  "Azerbaijan will destroy military targets in Armenia from which Armenia is firing on Azerbaijani cities," Hajiyev later said.  The new clashes erupted on Sept. 27 and international calls for a halt to hostilities have gone unanswered, with Armenia continuing its attacks on civilians and Azerbaijani forces, who are the rightful owners of the illegally occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region, as recognized by all United Nations members and the U.N. itself.  Border clashes broke out last Sunday when Armenian forces targeted Azerbaijani civilian settlements and military positions, leading to casualties. Azerbaijan's parliament declared a state of war in some of its cities and regions following Armenia's border violations and attacks in Nagorno-Karabakh.  On Monday, Azerbaijan declared partial military mobilization amid the clashes.  Relations between the two former Soviet nations have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh.  Four U.N. Security Council (UNSC) and two U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions, as well as many international organizations, have demanded the withdrawal of the occupying forces.

The 32-year-old high-flying businessman needs little introduction, having shot into the limelight for his influence in oil-rich Gulf countries, parties at exclusive clubs with the likes of socialite Paris Hilton and R&B superstar Usher, and his apparent close ties with top Malaysian politicians.  But beyond his flamboyant lifestyle, the Wharton graduate is back in the news – this time for his business dealings.  Consider this – Jynwel Capital – in which Jho Low is the chief executive officer, has in the last three years been involved in deals worth more than US$7bil (RM22bil).  Based on its deal flows, the firm, which is based in Hong Kong, stands taller than many Malaysian-helmed privately-owned entities. And it has caught the attention of Malaysians and foreigners alike.  Jynwel Capital was co-founded by Jho Low and his brother Szen Low in 2010. This was a year after Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), an entity where Jho Low served as an adviser for about five months from January 2009, failed to take off.  TIA was set up to manage the oil royalty money – amounting to more than RM1bil per year – that the state was getting from Petronas. The original plan was for the state to raise RM6bil and the Federal Government to fork out RM5bil to establish a major fund to spur investments in the state and the country.  But TIA did not take off. However the Federal Government went ahead with the RM5bil fund raising that was used to establish 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).  Jho Low and his brother Szen Low are the third generation of the Low family from Penang.  A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report has estimated the Low’s family wealth to be worth US$1.75bil (RM5.76bil).  A spokesperson for Jynwel Capital and the Low family, however, declines to verify the report, citing reasons of confidentiality and security protocols of the enlarged Low family and its beneficiaries.  Nevertheless, if the estimation by WSJ is indeed correct, then this would put the Low family’s wealth on par with some of corporate Malaysia’s richest tycoons like Tan Sri Vincent Tan of the Berjaya Group; Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King of the Rimbunan Hijau Group, and brothers Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin and Datuk Shahriman Shamsuddin of SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, going by Forbes richest-list ranking.  These personalities have a net worth ranging from US$1.4bil to US$1.8bil, according to Forbes magazine’s 2014 wealth survey for Malaysia.  While Jho Low may appear to be a prime driver in the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities of Jynwel Capital, the firm has participated as a minority investor in these investments except Myla, a spokesperson tells StarBizWeek.  “The Low family’s investment trusts (advised by Jynwel Capital Ltd) participated as minority investors in these investments, except for Myla where the Low family’s investment trusts took a majority stake.  “In certain transactions such as Coastal Energy, The Park Lane Hotel and Myla, Jynwel Capital sourced the transaction, acted as an investment adviser and took the lead in managing the transaction process,” the spokesperson says via email.  The spokesperson says majority stakeholders in the investments included entities with significant financial resources ranging from the global private equity firm the Blackstone Group’s GSO and sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority to high-net-worth billionaire investors such as David Geffen and Dr Thomas Kaplan.  Jynwel Capital has been more visible, given its cooperation with international blue-chip private equity firms, the spokesperson adds.  Prominent deals  On Tuesday, Jynwel Capital, jointly with Spain-based oil and gas (O&G) company Compañía Española de Petróleos, SAU (Cepsa), said it was in discussions to buy London-listed Salamander Energy PLC – a deal, which if successful, will make it a significant O&G player in Asia with production in excess of 50,000 barrels.  Just in the previous week, Jynwel Capital together with unnamed Abu Dhabi-based funds launched a 1.7 billion euros (RM7.06bil) bid to buy Reebok from Adidas AG.  In November last year, Jho Low created a stir in the O&G circle when he teamed up with Cepsa to take over Canadian-listed Coastal Energy Co. Coastal Energy has principal assets in Thailand and Malaysia.  Elsewhere, Jynwel Capital had invested in global commodities company Electrum Group with Kuwait Investment Authority; and was involved in the US$2.2bil acquisition of EMI Music Publishing jointly with The Blackstone Group’s GSO, Sony Corp, David Geffen and Mubadala Development Company.  The spokesperson says Jynwel Capital is positioned as an investment adviser to the Low family investment trusts and other consortium investors, besides being involved in investment and advisory services to professional investors. “We do not currently manage third-party funds,” the spokesperson states.  According to its website, Jynwel Capital has a focus on high-value investments in a variety of target sectors, including media and entertainment, consumer and retail, energy and resources, real estate and hospitality, precious metals, commodities and infrastructure.  Stronger foothold in O&G  Going forward, sources say that Jynwel Capital may be looking to build a stronger foothold in the lucrative O&G sector.  Sources say Coastal Energy has joined in the running to secure a production sharing contract (PSC) for Block PM9, which is a brownfield O&G development located offshore Terengganu.  The PSC for PM9 was supposed to have been awarded by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to the successful bidder by the end of 2013, according to various news reports last year. But little progress has been made so far.  The frontrunner for the project was then reported to be the joint venture comprising Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd and its Canadian partner Talisman Energy Inc.  Sources, however, tell StarBizWeek that the luck may have flipped, with Coastal Energy now seeming to be the favoured one to be awarded the PSC for PM9 by Petronas.  Coastal Energy already has an existing partnership with Petra Energy Bhd for a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang and Meranti cluster fields located offshore Peninsular Malaysia.  When asked on Coastal Energy possibly being awarded the PM9 field, the spokesperson says the Low family investor, Jho Low’s father Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng, is purely a minority passive investor in Coastal Energy, and thus, is not in a position to comment. In addition, the spokesperson notes, Larry is not on the board of Coastal Energy.  For the record, a spokesperson for JynWel Capital and the Low family would like to clarify the following:  1) Jho Low's full name Low Taek Jho, and not Low Teik Jho as published.  2) While the articles on Low stated that investments by Abu Dhabi funds in 2007/08 into Iskandar Malaysia and RHB Capital Bhd did not turn out well in subsequent years as the going was slow in Iskandar while RHB Cap shares did not reach the valuations that Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) had paid, the spokesperson said ADCB went through a bid process and sold its shares for a profit. Although it received offers higher than RM10.80 per share, it ultimately sold its shares to Aabar Investments PJS due to certainty and speed of closing.  3) On Iskandar Malaysia, the spokesperson said while it faced challenges in subsequent stages (after the investment in 2007) due to weak global economic conditions, in the last few years the real estate market there had grown tremendously, and the Mudabala consortium was making a good return.

However the Federal Government went ahead with the RM5bil fund raising that was used to establish 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).</p>\n\n<p>Jho Low and his brother Szen Low are the third generation of the Low family from Penang.</p>\n\n<p>A <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (<em>WSJ</em>) report has estimated the Low’s family wealth to be worth US$1.75bil (RM5.76bil).</p>\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/8760427B-D817-4678-903C-CD5007C92A4E"></figure>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Jynwel Capital and the Low family, however, declines to verify the report, citing reasons of confidentiality and security protocols of the enlarged Low family and its beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if the estimation by <em>WSJ</em> is indeed correct, then this would put the Low family’s wealth on par with some of corporate Malaysia’s richest tycoons like Tan Sri Vincent Tan of the Berjaya Group; Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King of the Rimbunan Hijau Group, and brothers Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin and Datuk Shahriman Shamsuddin of SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, going by <em>Forbes</em> richest-list ranking.</p>\n\n<p>These personalities have a net worth ranging from US$1.4bil to US$1.8bil, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s 2014 wealth survey for Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>While Jho Low may appear to be a prime driver in the merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities of Jynwel Capital, the firm has participated as a minority investor in these investments except Myla, a spokesperson tells <em>StarBizWeek</em>.</p>\n\n<p>“The Low family’s investment trusts (advised by Jynwel Capital Ltd) participated as minority investors in these investments, except for Myla where the Low family’s investment trusts took a majority stake.</p>\n\n<p>“In certain transactions such as Coastal Energy, The Park Lane Hotel and Myla, Jynwel Capital sourced the transaction, acted as an investment adviser and took the lead in managing the transaction process,” the spokesperson says via email.</p>\n\n<p>The spokesperson says majority stakeholders in the investments included entities with significant financial resources ranging from the global private equity firm the Blackstone Group’s GSO and sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority to high-net-worth billionaire investors such as David Geffen and Dr Thomas Kaplan.</p>\n\n<p>Jynwel Capital has been more visible, given its cooperation with international blue-chip private equity firms, the spokesperson adds.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/3E484E62-B7AC-4EFF-BD86-9673E88C108E"></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Prominent deals</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Jynwel Capital, jointly with Spain-based oil and gas (O&amp;G) company Compañía Española de Petróleos, SAU (Cepsa), said it was in discussions to buy London-listed Salamander Energy PLC – a deal, which if successful, will make it a significant O&amp;G player in Asia with production in excess of 50,000 barrels.</p>\n\n<p>Just in the previous week, Jynwel Capital together with unnamed Abu Dhabi-based funds launched a 1.7 billion euros (RM7.06bil) bid to buy <em>Reebok </em>from Adidas AG.</p>\n\n<p>In November last year, Jho Low created a stir in the O&amp;G circle when he teamed up with Cepsa to take over Canadian-listed Coastal Energy Co. Coastal Energy has principal assets in Thailand and Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Jynwel Capital had invested in global commodities company Electrum Group with Kuwait Investment Authority; and was involved in the US$2.2bil acquisition of EMI Music Publishing jointly with The Blackstone Group’s GSO, Sony Corp, David Geffen and Mubadala Development Company.</p>\n\n<p>The spokesperson says Jynwel Capital is positioned as an investment adviser to the Low family investment trusts and other consortium investors, besides being involved in investment and advisory services to professional investors. “We do not currently manage third-party funds,” the spokesperson states.</p>\n\n<p>According to its website, Jynwel Capital has a focus on high-value investments in a variety of target sectors, including media and entertainment, consumer and retail, energy and resources, real estate and hospitality, precious metals, commodities and infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stronger foothold in O&amp;G </strong></p>\n\n<p>Going forward, sources say that Jynwel Capital may be looking to build a stronger foothold in the lucrative O&amp;G sector.</p>\n\n<p>Sources say Coastal Energy has joined in the running to secure a production sharing contract (PSC) for Block PM9, which is a brownfield O&amp;G development located offshore Terengganu.</p>\n\n<p>The PSC for PM9 was supposed to have been awarded by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to the successful bidder by the end of 2013, according to various news reports last year. But little progress has been made so far.</p>\n\n<p>The frontrunner for the project was then reported to be the joint venture comprising <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=PERISAI">Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd</a><a href="http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=PERISAI"><img src="https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png"></a> and its Canadian partner Talisman Energy Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Sources, however, tell <em>StarBizWeek </em>that the luck may have flipped, with Coastal Energy now seeming to be the favoured one to be awarded the PSC for PM9 by Petronas.</p>\n\n<p>Coastal Energy already has an existing partnership with <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=PENERGY">Petra Energy Bhd</a><a href="http://charts.thestar.com.my/?s=PENERGY"><img src="https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/chart.png"></a> for a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang and Meranti cluster fields located offshore Peninsular Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>When asked on Coastal Energy possibly being awarded the PM9 field, the spokesperson says the Low family investor, Jho Low’s father Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng, is purely a minority passive investor in Coastal Energy, and thus, is not in a position to comment. In addition, the spokesperson notes, Larry is not on the board of Coastal Energy.</p>\n\n<p><em>For the record, a spokesperson for JynWel Capital and the Low family would like to clarify the following:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>1) Jho Low\'s full name Low Taek Jho, and not Low Teik Jho as published.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>2) While the articles on Low stated that investments by Abu Dhabi funds in 2007/08 into Iskandar Malaysia and RHB Capital Bhd did not turn out well in subsequent years as the going was slow in Iskandar while RHB Cap shares did not reach the valuations that Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) had paid, the spokesperson said ADCB went through a bid process and sold its shares for a profit.

Carel	Michael Mischin	Individual	https://theconversation.com/fraudsters-change-tactics-as-a-crackdown-cuts-some-losses-due-to-online-scams-54905	The amount of financial loss from online fraud suffered by people in Western Australia has almost halved, dropping from A$16.8 million in 2014 to A$9.8 million for 2015, according to a statement this January from the state’s Attorney General and Minister for Commerce, Michael Mischin.  In addition, the minister noted that losses from relationship and dating fraud have fallen by 55%, to A$4.9 million lost last year.  These are both impressive claims, and at face value, there is truth to the statistics. Both assertions are based on data received by WA’s Scamnet, which is the public interface between consumer protection and citizens.  While it is good to see a reduction in the number of losses overall, particularly to relationship and dating fraud, it is highly unlikely that the statistics tell the full story.  An under-reported crime  It is well known that fraud has one of the lowest reporting rates of crime types. Reasons include uncertainly in whether a crime has been committed, not knowing who to report to and the shame and embarrassment of being deceived. Generally speaking, reported fraud losses are understood as the tip of the iceberg of actual money lost and harm experienced by victims.  The minister’s statement also covered Project Sunbird, a joint initiative between West Australian Police and the West Australian Department of Commerce. Project Sunbird uses financial intelligence to identify and contact people who are sending money to West African countries and notifies them of any suspicions.  The statistics for Project Sunbird show more modest reductions, with the minister reporting that the overall amount of money sent for romance and investment fraud decreased by 26% in 2015. About 72% of people who received a first letter warning of any suspicions stopped sending money immediately, and half of those who received a second letter also stopped sending money.  Again, the statistics are exciting and point to some positive results from Project Sunbird. But there are also caveats to these statistics.  I am a strong supporter of the Project Sunbird approach and have written before on its benefits. But I also believe there are factors that need to be considered in conjunction with these latest reported statistics.  Scammers on the move  Project Sunbird only looks at transactions to a small cluster of five West African countries – Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leonne and Togo. Historically, these have been hot spots for offenders.  Offenders are now asking victims to send money to other countries, including some in Asia, which are not targeted under Project Sunbird, and other similar projects.  The evaluation period for Project Sunbird is three months and only covers the five West African countries. While people may cease sending within these limits, there is currently no ability to expand the project to other countries for a longer period of time.  There has also been a shift in the ways that victims transfer money overseas. Offenders are increasingly using (often unsuspecting) money mules in Australia to move money.  In my latest research interviewing online fraud victims, a large number of victims were asked to send money via a bank transfer to an Australian account. This has changed from earlier work I did where the main focus was on remittance agencies, such as Western Union and Moneygram.  This new approach appealed to victims who were aware of the risks in sending money overseas. There was an increased sense of legitimacy in transferring the money to an Australian bank account.  But once transferred to the Australian account, the money is quickly shifted offshore to offenders. None of this is captured in the Project Sunbird figures.  Changed tactics  Offenders are also changing the methods they use to ask for money. Rather than sending cash through a remittance agency or bank transfer, there is anecdotal evidence from police that some victims have been asked to buy prepaid debit cards and forward these on.  Offenders still receive something of monetary value. However, the use of prepaid currencies avoids current forms of detection.  There are many other factors that could also be considered. For example, the existence of a few high-loss victims can increase or decrease overall dollar values figures significantly.  It is encouraging to see the current downward trend in statistics of the money lost to fraud. Project Sunbird has done a lot in terms of awareness raising and education for the community. It is also an important tool for law enforcement and consumer protection agencies in their bid to reduce victimisation.  Why do people still fall for scams?  There is a great opportunity to further evaluate the impact of Project Sunbird and its influence/crossover with Scamnet results. But I know that whatever the statistics say, there is still the question of “why do so many people fall for it?”  My response is simple. It’s important to remember the highly skilled nature of offenders. It’s critical not to underestimate their skills of persuasion and the many social engineering techniques they use to manipulate and exploit individual vulnerabilities.  Everyone has a weakness which, if targeted in the right way at the right time, may make them susceptible. We need to acknowledge that.  The current figures paint a hopeful picture that sees a decrease in the number of victims and the associated amount of losses, though I would argue it is not cause for celebration yet.  Online fraud still poses a significant problem to Australians. It would be a mistake to think that Project Sunbird has solved the issue based on the combination of these statistics.  Rather we must turn our attention to the evolution of these offences and the new ways offenders are targeting potential victims. We must look for new opportunities to ensure that Project Sunbird and other future approaches to combating online fraud are as fluid and flexible as the offenders they seek to target.

But there are also caveats to these statistics.</p>\n\n<p>I am a strong supporter of the Project Sunbird approach and have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-tackle-cyber-crime-before-people-even-know-theyre-a-victim-38385">written before</a> on its <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/81282/">benefits</a>. But I also believe there are factors that need to be considered in conjunction with these latest reported statistics.</p>\n\n<h2>Scammers on the move</h2>\n\n<p>Project Sunbird only looks at transactions to a small cluster of five West African countries – Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leonne and Togo. Historically, these have been hot spots for offenders.</p>\n\n<p>Offenders are now asking victims to send money to other countries, including some in Asia, which are not targeted under Project Sunbird, and other <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/93198/">similar projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The evaluation period for Project Sunbird is three months and only covers the five West African countries. While people may cease sending within these limits, there is currently no ability to expand the project to other countries for a longer period of time.</p>\n\n<p>There has also been a shift in the ways that victims transfer money overseas. Offenders are increasingly using (often unsuspecting) money mules in Australia to move money.</p>\n\n<p>In my latest research interviewing online fraud victims, a large number of victims were asked to send money via a bank transfer to an Australian account. This has changed from earlier work I did where the main focus was on remittance agencies, such as Western Union and Moneygram.</p>\n\n<p>This new approach appealed to victims who were aware of the risks in sending money overseas. There was an increased sense of legitimacy in transferring the money to an Australian bank account.</p>\n\n<p>But once transferred to the Australian account, the money is quickly shifted offshore to offenders. None of this is captured in the Project Sunbird figures.</p>\n\n<h2>Changed tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Offenders are also changing the methods they use to ask for money. Rather than sending cash through a remittance agency or bank transfer, there is anecdotal evidence from police that some victims have been asked to buy prepaid debit cards and forward these on.</p>\n\n<p>Offenders still receive something of monetary value. However, the use of prepaid currencies avoids current forms of detection.</p>\n\n<p>There are many other factors that could also be considered. For example, the existence of a few high-loss victims can increase or decrease overall dollar values figures significantly.</p>\n\n<p>It is encouraging to see the current downward trend in statistics of the money lost to fraud. Project Sunbird has done a lot in terms of awareness raising and education for the community. It is also an important tool for law enforcement and consumer protection agencies in their bid to reduce victimisation.</p>\n\n<h2>Why do people still fall for scams?</h2>\n\n<p>There is a great opportunity to further evaluate the impact of Project Sunbird and its influence/crossover with Scamnet results. But I know that whatever the statistics say, there is still the question of “why do so many people fall for it?”</p>\n\n<p>My response is simple. It’s important to remember the highly skilled nature of offenders. It’s critical not to underestimate their skills of persuasion and the many <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/66444/">social engineering techniques</a> they use to manipulate and exploit individual vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has a weakness which, if targeted in the right way at the right time, may make them susceptible. We need to acknowledge that.</p>\n\n<p>The current figures paint a hopeful picture that sees a decrease in the number of victims and the associated amount of losses, though I would argue it is not cause for celebration yet.</p>\n\n<p>Online fraud still poses a significant problem to Australians. It would be a mistake to think that Project Sunbird has solved the issue based on the combination of these statistics.</p>\n\n<p>Rather we must turn our attention to the evolution of these offences and the new ways offenders are targeting potential victims. We must look for new opportunities to ensure that Project Sunbird and other future approaches to combating online fraud are as fluid and flexible as the offenders they seek to target.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2019-10-21T03:35:12Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2016-03-01T04:05:07Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	Financial loss from online fraud decreases over time and a project to detect farud 	Wanting		Fraudsters change tactics as a crackdown cuts some losses due to online scams
Carel	Ma Jiantang	Individual	https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/chinas-baffling-gdp-figures/275441/	But something baffling arises when one compares the number published by the central government with those published by provincial authorities. By April 29, all of the 31 provincial governments had released economic statistics. Among them, in all defiance of the law of averages, no single province claimed a real GDP growth rate lower than the nationwide number. What gives?  Although apparently surprising, the contradiction between the national and provincial data is nothing more than a continuation of a long-time trend. In 2012, the real GDP growth rates released by all provincial authorities except Beijing and Shanghai exceeded 7.8 percent, the nationwide figure.  In 1985, the national statistics bureau and provincial statistic agencies were separated into two non-interfering systems. Since then, economic data from each province have been gathered and calculated by each provincial agency independently. The national bureau has been charged only with accounting for national economic data, without relying on data briefed by each province. Since 1985, a discrepancy between national and provincial data has been continuously widening. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the sum of GDP figures released by all provincial agencies outnumbered the figure from the national bureau by 2.68 trillion RMB (US$430 billion), 3.5 trillion RMB and 4.6 trillion RMB, respectively. In 2012, the gap grew to 5.73 trillion RMB, approximately 11 percent of China's national GDP.  This discrepancy is partially explained by technicalities. When collecting primary data, the central bureau and provincial agencies sometimes use different basic "reference point" data and statistical calibrations. Second, certain inter-provincial economic activities are claimed by all the provinces involved, leading to double counting.  Yet it is hardly possible that technical errors alone can account for such a consistent, substantial, and ever-growing discrepancy. Chinese media and citizens have inevitably speculated that economic data have been artificially modified.  Part of this skepticism traces to the incentive system for Chinese officials. Economic performance is still used as a major criterion for the evaluation and promotion of provincial bureaucrats. This leaves economic statistics particularly subject to political manipulation to serve officials' personal interest. As @ xuehanbo observes on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter, "The reason why the data published by provincial agencies are falsely high is actually simple: the local authorities are still crazy for GDP growth, which is the key standard used to appraise officials' performance." During a meeting in April 2012, Ma Jiantang, chief of the National Statistics Bureau, explicitly admitted that data fabrication has been the major source of statistical distortion.  In order to solve the problem, the National Statistics Bureau has proposed several initiatives to reform the bifurcated statistical reporting system. In 2004, the Bureau proposed to monitor all economic data reported by provincial agencies. In 2006 and again in 2011, the Bureau advocated for the merger of the separate systems and offered to take direct charge of provincial economic statistics reporting.  Yet none of these proposed initiatives has been turned into sustained practice. For one, the root cause of statistical corruption would not have been eliminated with reforms. Since the current system of evaluation and promotion of officials provides the primary incentive for statistical manipulation, it is in fact this system that needs to be changed. An recent editorial by the Beijing Youth Daily (@ 北京青年报) suggests as much:  There is only one way to end the contradiction between provincial and national GDP statistics: to reform the official evaluation system and increase citizens' say in the process so that local authorities are not responsible for GDP growth alone, but also the environment, high-quality public services, and sustainable development. Only then will there be hope of freeing ourselves from the awkward GDP fights between localities and the central government.

Shakshi	Mustafa Al-Kadhimi	Individual	https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/four-takeaways-from-iraqi-prime-minister-mustafa-al-kadhimis-visit/	If there was one principal outcome from President Trump’s meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on August 20, it was an alignment of expectations for the future US-Iraqi relationship. On the most important US concern, Kadhimi did not promise to eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq, and Trump did not press him on it. He did not need to.  The visit itself, and others like it, is much of how the United States competes with Iran in Iraq: through engagements, visits, and other symbolic gestures, which reinforce the current political trends of an Iraqi populace that simultaneously wants US engagement with Iran, does not want to confront militias militarily, and, above all else, does not want a US-Iran confrontation to materialize on its soil. And that is usually good enough for American national-security interests.  The Iraqi prime minister’s visit was important first and foremost as a message to Iraq’s public and political class. The visit should be viewed as neither an American concession to Kadhimi nor an American reward for policy steps he has taken, but rather a tool in the competition for political influence between the United States and Iran in Iraq. It is no coincidence that Iran also hosted Kadhimi for a similar high-profile visit a month ago, before he visited the United States and intended to visit Saudi Arabia—in Iraqi politics, a victory for Iran.  The meeting provided a message to the same Iraqi audience about Iran’s influence with Iraq’s new leader. Iran similarly used last November’s visit by the Iraqi populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to send a message to Iraqis protesting its influence over Iraq’s internal affairs. Sadr controlled one of the few militias with the capability to defend the protestors, and Iran wanted them to know he would not intervene to protect them, even though Tehran couldn’t be sure that this was the case. The symbolism is the message with these visits, not necessarily the immediate policy results.  The second consideration to keep in mind is that the Iranian government does not own the Iraqi prime minister, and neither does the United States. I worked with Kadhimi for years while at the US State Department and always admired his pragmatism, his support for Iraqi nationalism, and his genuine pro-US sentiments, while acknowledging that he, like every single Iraqi politician, was ultimately a realist. Any Iraqi leader who becomes prime minister will represent shades of strategic gray for the United States.  As a predominantly Shia country, and one that is economically tied to Iran, Iraq is unlikely to produce a leader who will share the same perception of regional security as that of US partners such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. However, if the United States plays its cards right, the Iraqis are unlikely to choose a leader from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and their political allies.  That’s enough to both limit Iraq’s threat to US partners and shape the Iraqi political environment in a manner that mitigates domestic fallout as we compete with Iran in Iraq and the region.Our policy comfort in choosing among shades of gray will impact how good we are at it. If US officials refuse a visit to the US until Kadhimi does X, Y, and Z, the chances are less likely he will do those things. It’s good we didn’t.  Third, Iraqis also see this visit as more of a means of affording Kadhimi personal capital and less as some gauzy message about an amorphous bilateral relationship. In Iraq, the United States must gear its policy toward individuals and not institutions, because that is how the Iraqi political game is played. The United States cannot solve the problems of the modern Arab state; when it has tried, most spectacularly in the Iraq War, it has failed. But the United States can focus on necessary short-term results, particularly those that benefit both Iraqis and Americans, rather than gearing its methods to what it thinks Iraq should look like in twenty years. Almost certainly, in the decades ahead, Iraqi politics will still very much be an individual game, with powerful political leaders looking for sponsors.  Virtually every senior politician in Iraq receives some sort of support from one or many regional powers. In a life-or-death political environment, that is necessary. The United States must play this way because it is how the game is played. The tools are visits, visas, investment, aid, and sanctions. The more these can be targeted at an individual level, to reward and punish individuals and compete within the gray zone of Iraqi politics, the better results the United States will have.  Fourth, there will always be redlines. The most pressing strategic problem for the United States are those elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), militias raised and loosely incorporated under the government’s aegis, that answer to Iran. During his joint press availability with Trump, Kadhimi completely ducked questions about the militias, instead stressing US help in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the need for economic engagement. He delivered a similarly non-committal message to Iran last month.  Iraqi politicians want to adopt a see-no-evil policy toward the sharper edge of US-Iran competition in Iraq. Last summer, despite a series of explosions at PMF facilities, there was neither a binding Iraqi parliamentary vote to kick out US troops nor a political endorsement of reprisals, because civil war in Iraq is a political loser. Virtually no Iraqi wants the US-Iran competition to play out militarily in Iraq. The Iranians know it, their proxies know it, and Iraqi politicians know it. That’s a victory for the United States as it works to restrain the militias, the Iranians’ most potent tool.  At the joint press event with Kadhimi, Trump had it exactly right on militias: He said that when there are attacks, we deal with those attacks, but we do not burn down the house that the US and Iraq have built. Like his predecessors, Kadhimi cannot fix the seventeen-year problem of militias in Iraqi territory. The United States must be realistic about this problem, as the US has not been able to fix it either.  Indeed, in forty years of confronting Iran, the United States has never successfully solved the problem of Iranian support for militias acting as states within states. The US relationship with Kadhimi cannot depend on whether he succeeds where we have historically failed. Instead, Washington must compete in the gray zone, for partial victory, with all the tools at its disposal. This visit was a good start.

On the most important US concern, Kadhimi did not promise to eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq, and Trump did not press him on it. He did not need to.\n\nThe visit itself, and others like it, is much of how the United States competes with Iran in Iraq: through engagements, visits, and other symbolic gestures, which reinforce the current political trends of an Iraqi populace that simultaneously wants US engagement with Iran, does not want to confront militias militarily, and, above all else, does not want a US-Iran confrontation to materialize on its soil. And that is usually good enough for American national-security interests.\n\nThe Iraqi prime minister’s visit was important first and foremost as a message to Iraq’s public and political class. The visit should be viewed as neither an American concession to Kadhimi nor an American reward for policy steps he has taken, but rather a tool in the competition for political influence between the United States and Iran in Iraq. It is no coincidence that Iran also hosted Kadhimi for a similar high-profile visit a month ago, before he visited the United States and intended to visit Saudi Arabia—in Iraqi politics, a victory for Iran.\n\nThe meeting provided a message to the same Iraqi audience about Iran’s influence with Iraq’s new leader. Iran similarly used last November’s visit by the Iraqi populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to send a message to Iraqis protesting its influence over Iraq’s internal affairs. Sadr controlled one of the few militias with the capability to defend the protestors, and Iran wanted them to know he would not intervene to protect them, even though Tehran couldn’t be sure that this was the case. The symbolism is the message with these visits, not necessarily the immediate policy results.\n\nThe second consideration to keep in mind is that the Iranian government does not own the Iraqi prime minister, and neither does the United States. I worked with Kadhimi for years while at the US State Department and always admired his pragmatism, his support for Iraqi nationalism, and his genuine pro-US sentiments, while acknowledging that he, like every single Iraqi politician, was ultimately a realist. Any Iraqi leader who becomes prime minister will represent shades of strategic gray for the United States.\n\nAs a predominantly Shia country, and one that is economically tied to Iran, Iraq is unlikely to produce a leader who will share the same perception of regional security as that of US partners such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. However, if the United States plays its cards right, the Iraqis are unlikely to choose a leader from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and their political allies.\n\nThat’s enough to both limit Iraq’s threat to US partners and shape the Iraqi political environment in a manner that mitigates domestic fallout as we compete with Iran in Iraq and the region.Our policy comfort in choosing among shades of gray will impact how good we are at it. If US officials refuse a visit to the US until Kadhimi does X, Y, and Z, the chances are less likely he will do those things. It’s good we didn’t.\n\nThird, Iraqis also see this visit as more of a means of affording Kadhimi personal capital and less as some gauzy message about an amorphous bilateral relationship. In Iraq, the United States must gear its policy toward individuals and not institutions, because that is how the Iraqi political game is played. The United States cannot solve the problems of the modern Arab state; when it has tried, most spectacularly in the Iraq War, it has failed. But the United States can focus on necessary short-term results, particularly those that benefit both Iraqis and Americans, rather than gearing its methods to what it thinks Iraq should look like in twenty years. Almost certainly, in the decades ahead, Iraqi politics will still very much be an individual game, with powerful political leaders looking for sponsors.\n\nVirtually every senior politician in Iraq receives some sort of support from one or many regional powers. In a life-or-death political environment, that is necessary. The United States must play this way because it is how the game is played. The tools are visits, visas, investment, aid, and sanctions. The more these can be targeted at an individual level, to reward and punish individuals and compete within the gray zone of Iraqi politics, the better results the United States will have.\n\nFourth, there will always be redlines. The most pressing strategic problem for the United States are those elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), militias raised and loosely incorporated under the government’s aegis, that answer to Iran. During his joint press availability with Trump, Kadhimi completely ducked questions about the militias, instead stressing US help in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the need for economic engagement. He delivered a similarly non-committal message to Iran last month.\n\nIraqi politicians want to adopt a see-no-evil policy toward the sharper edge of US-Iran competition in Iraq. Last summer, despite a series of explosions at PMF facilities, there was neither a binding Iraqi parliamentary vote to kick out US troops nor a political endorsement of reprisals, because civil war in Iraq is a political loser. Virtually no Iraqi wants the US-Iran competition to play out militarily in Iraq. The Iranians know it, their proxies know it, and Iraqi politicians know it.

'articleBodyHtml': '<article>\n\n<p>If there was one principal outcome from President Trump’s meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on August 20, it was an alignment of expectations for the future US-Iraqi relationship.\xa0On the most important US concern, Kadhimi did not promise to eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq, and Trump did not press him on it. He did not need to.</p>\n\n<p>The visit itself, and others like it, is much of how the United States competes with Iran in Iraq: through engagements, visits, and other symbolic gestures, which reinforce the current political trends of an Iraqi populace that simultaneously wants US engagement with Iran, does not want to confront militias militarily, and, above all else, does not want a US-Iran confrontation to materialize on its soil. And that is usually good enough for American national-security interests.</p>\n\n<p>The Iraqi prime minister’s visit was important first and foremost as a message to Iraq’s public and political class. The visit should be viewed as neither an American concession to Kadhimi nor an American reward for policy steps he has taken, but rather a tool in the competition for political influence between the United States and Iran in Iraq. It is no coincidence that Iran also <a href="https://english.khamenei.ir/photo/7784/Imam-Khamenei-met-with-Iraqi-Prime-Minister">hosted Kadhimi</a> for a similar high-profile visit a month ago, before he visited the United States and intended to visit Saudi Arabia—in Iraqi politics, a victory for Iran.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting provided a message to the same Iraqi audience about Iran’s influence with Iraq’s new leader. Iran similarly used last November’s <a href="https://youtu.be/CMAtjCA-VTA">visit</a> by the Iraqi populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to send a message to Iraqis protesting its influence over Iraq’s internal affairs. Sadr controlled one of the few militias with the capability to defend the protestors, and Iran wanted them to know he would not intervene to protect them, even though Tehran couldn’t be sure that this was the case. The symbolism is the message with these visits, not necessarily the immediate policy results.</p>\n\n<p>The second consideration to keep in mind is that the Iranian government does not own the Iraqi prime minister, and neither does the United States. I worked with Kadhimi for years while at the US State Department and always admired his pragmatism, his support for Iraqi nationalism, and his genuine pro-US sentiments, while acknowledging that he, like every single Iraqi politician, was ultimately a realist. Any Iraqi leader who becomes prime minister will represent shades of strategic gray for the United States.</p>\n\n<p>As a predominantly Shia country, and one that is economically tied to Iran, Iraq is unlikely to produce a leader who will share the same perception of regional security as that of US partners such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. However, if the United States plays its cards right, the Iraqis are unlikely to choose a leader from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and their political allies.</p>\n\n<p>That’s enough to both limit Iraq’s threat to US partners and shape the Iraqi political environment in a manner that mitigates domestic fallout as we compete with Iran in Iraq and the region.Our policy comfort in choosing among shades of gray will impact how good we are at it.\xa0 If US officials refuse a visit to the US until Kadhimi does X, Y, and Z, the chances are less likely he will do those things.\xa0 It’s good we didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>Third, Iraqis also see this visit as more of a means of affording Kadhimi personal capital and less as some gauzy message about an amorphous bilateral relationship. In Iraq, the United States must gear its policy toward individuals and not institutions, because that is how the Iraqi political game is played. The United States cannot solve the problems of the modern Arab state; when it has tried, most spectacularly in the Iraq War, it has failed. But the United States can focus on necessary short-term results, particularly those that benefit both Iraqis and Americans, rather than gearing its methods to what it thinks Iraq should look like in twenty years. Almost certainly, in the decades ahead, Iraqi politics will still very much be an individual game, with powerful political leaders looking for sponsors.</p>\n\n<p>Virtually every senior politician in Iraq receives some sort of support from one or many regional powers. In a life-or-death political environment, that is necessary. The United States must play this way because it is how the game is played. The tools are visits, visas, investment, aid, and sanctions. The more these can be targeted at an individual level, to reward and punish individuals and compete within the gray zone of Iraqi politics, the better results the United States will have.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, there will always be redlines. The most pressing strategic problem for the United States are those elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), militias raised and loosely incorporated under the government’s aegis, that answer to Iran. During his joint press availability with Trump, Kadhimi completely ducked questions about the militias, instead stressing US help in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the need for economic engagement. He <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/iraq-pm-vows-won-threats-iran-iraqi-soil-200721161008742.html">delivered</a> a similarly non-committal message to Iran last month.</p>\n\n<p>Iraqi politicians want to adopt a see-no-evil policy toward the sharper edge of US-Iran competition in Iraq. Last summer, despite a series of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/explosion-rocks-arms-depot-north-iraq-baghdad-190820171200992.html">explosions</a> at PMF facilities, \xa0there was neither a binding Iraqi parliamentary vote to kick out US troops nor a political endorsement of reprisals, because civil war in Iraq is a political loser. Virtually no Iraqi wants the US-Iran competition to play out militarily in Iraq. The Iranians know it, their proxies know it, and Iraqi politicians know it. That’s a victory for the United States as it works to restrain the militias, the Iranians’ most potent tool.</p>\n\n<p>At the joint press event with Kadhimi, Trump had it exactly right on militias: He said that when there are attacks, we deal with those attacks, but we do not burn down the house that the US and Iraq have built. Like his predecessors, Kadhimi cannot fix the seventeen-year problem of militias in Iraqi territory. The United States must be realistic about this problem, as the US has not been able to fix it either.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in forty years of confronting Iran, the United States has never successfully solved the problem of Iranian support for militias acting as states within states. The US relationship with Kadhimi cannot depend on whether he succeeds where we have historically failed. Instead, Washington must compete in the gray zone, for partial victory, with all the tools at its disposal.\xa0 This visit was a good start.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-11-02T18:55:48+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-08-26T17:25:13+00:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	relationship between USA and Iraqi	Wanting		Four takeaways from Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi’s visit

Carel	Michael Morris	Individual	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2789875/former-tv-presenter-mike-morris-died-nhs-staff-failed-spot-deterioration-following-bladder-cancer-surgery.html	Former TVAM presenter Mike Morris died after NHS staff failed to spot warning signs following bladder cancer surgery, an inquest has heard.  Mr Morris, who made his name alongside Lorraine Kelly and Anne Diamond on the breakfast show, was only 66 when he died two years ago.  He had been fully expected to recover from an operation at East Surrey Hospital, to correct bleeding following bladder cancer surgery.  But an inquest in Surrey heard that a succession of failures by doctors, over many hours, led to a cardiac arrest in the early hours of the morning.  Medical witnesses told the coroner how his condition had deteriorated with no action taken to move him from a general ward to a high dependency unit.  Coroner Karen Henderson said: 'Mr Morris died from complications of necessary surgery when post operative deterioration in his condition was not recognised and consequently went un-treated.'  His death had been completely unexpected and no members of his family were present when he died in early hours of the morning at the Redhill hospital in October 2012.  Morris, who got a world exclusive interview with Nelson Mandela on his release from jail, had undergone surgery a week earlier but had developed bleeding in his urine and been re-admitted for surgery to stem significant blood loss.  He was given 5 units of blood and placed on a ward to recover.  An early warning system which monitors vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, breathing and heart rate, soon showed that Morris needed more intensive help than was available on the ward.  But a succession of nurses and doctors failed to act on the warning signs, the inquest was told.  Mr Morris went into cardiac arrest at around 6am and died at 7.10am.  Gregory Armon-Jones, who is married to Mr Morris's daughter, Helen, said the family was shocked by his diagnosis but they had taken heart from the fact his cancer was a low grade and could be easily treated.  He said: 'He had various health problems, including heart problems. He also had bladder cancer but, as far as we were concerned, this was under control.'  He said that the news of his death shocked the family.  Mr Armon-Jones, said: 'He was a larger than life character.  'You only have to watch some of the old videos of him presenting to see that. He had separated from my mother-in-law and lived on his own.  'His whole life revolved around his family, especially his two daughters Helen and Sarah, and his grandchildren.  'One of the reasons myself and Helen moved to Hersham in Surrey was to be closer to him.  Dr Des Holden, medical director at Surrey & Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The review shows aspects of Mr Morris' care after his emergency surgery were below that which he and his family were entitled to expect.  'The trust has apologised to Mr Morris' family and has introduced a range of measures to improve the post-operative care for high risk patients.  'The capacity in both the Intensive Care Unit and the High Dependency Unit have been increased to cope with demand and changes have been made to the way the ICU and outreach teams are staffed and the work patterns within the teams.'  Mr Holden said no members of staff had been disciplined as 'our investigation showed everyone involved in Mr Morris's care was trying to do their best for him.'  Famous for his distinctive moustache, Morris joined TV-am as a sports presenter, eventually becoming the host of Good Morning Britain in 1987. He remained with TV-am until 1992.  During his stint as main weekday anchor, he presented alongside Anne Diamond, Kathy Rochford, Kathryn Holloway, Kathy Tayler, Linda Mitchell, Maya Even and Lorraine Kelly.

He also had bladder cancer but, as far as we were concerned, this was under control.'\n\nHe said that the news of his death shocked the family.\n\nMr Armon-Jones, said: 'He was a larger than life character.\n\n'You only have to watch some of the old videos of him presenting to see that. He had separated from my mother-in-law and lived on his own.\n\n'His whole life revolved around his family, especially his two daughters Helen and Sarah, and his grandchildren.\n\n'One of the reasons myself and Helen moved to Hersham in Surrey was to be closer to him.\n\nDr Des Holden, medical director at Surrey & Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The review shows aspects of Mr Morris' care after his emergency surgery were below that which he and his family were entitled to expect.\n\n'The trust has apologised to Mr Morris' family and has introduced a range of measures to improve the post-operative care for high risk patients.\n\n'The capacity in both the Intensive Care Unit and the High Dependency Unit have been increased to cope with demand and changes have been made to the way the ICU and outreach teams are staffed and the work patterns within the teams.'\n\nMr Holden said no members of staff had been disciplined as 'our investigation showed everyone involved in Mr Morris's care was trying to do their best for him.'\n\nFamous for his distinctive moustache, Morris joined TV-am as a sports presenter, eventually becoming the host of Good Morning Britain in 1987.

Carel	Arab Bank	Organization	https://www.justsecurity.org/45810/terrorist-financing-backgrounder/	Ed. note. This post is the latest in our series on the U.S. Supreme Court case Jesner. v. Arab Bank, a case that is slated to resolve the question of whether corporations can be sued under international law. Oral arguments are today.  One of the causes of action asserted in the Supreme Court’s case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, is terrorist financing, an international crime also at issue in the case brought by Ukraine against Russia before the International Court of Justice (see my coverage here). As the Court hears arguments today on the case, this article provides background on the multilateral treaty prohibiting terrorist financing and calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, both criminally and civilly. It also situates this treaty within other multilateral efforts to prohibit various manifestations of terrorism.  The prohibition on terrorist financing finds expression in the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (“Convention”), adopted by the United Nations on December 9, 1999, with Resolution A/54/109. The Convention went into effect on April 10, 2002, and has been ratified by all U.N. states with the exception of Burundi, Chad, Eritrea, Gambia, Iran, Lebanon, Somalia, and South Sudan.  The heart of the Convention is found in Article 2(1), which defines the target offense as follows:  Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:  (a) An act which constitutes an offense within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or  (b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such an act, by its 1nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act.  The prohibited act is complete once the funds are conveyed; it is not necessary to prove that the funds were actually used to carry out a terrorist offense.  The Convention broke new ground by identifying the purpose of terrorism, namely to terrorize the population. The treaty is thus premised upon the actual intention, or knowledge, that the funds will be used to carry out one of the offenses listed in an annex to the Convention. This specific intent element is important because it distinguishes the financing of terrorism from legitimate humanitarian assistance or international investment. It also distinguishes acts of terrorism from ordinary crimes—a challenge for all of international criminal law.  An express goal of the treaty drafters was to oblige states to bring to justice those who provided the financial backing for terrorist acts. In addition to the direct perpetration of terrorist financing, the treaty also prohibits attempts, acts of complicity, and individuals who contribute to a group acting with a common purpose. The treaty permits states to apply a whole range of jurisdictional bases, including when the perpetrator is merely present in the state, even if the perpetrator is not a national and the offence did not occur in that state. In this way, the treaty—like many other terrorism treaties—provides for a form of qualified universal jurisdiction over offences.  The Convention also requires state signatories to enable civil liability for perpetrators—including legal persons. Article 5 mandates each state,  in accordance with its domestic legal principles, shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has, in that capacity, committed an offence set forth in article 2.  Such liability is incurred without prejudice to the criminal liability of individuals having committed the offences per Article 5 of the Convention.  Prior to the terror attacks of 9/11, the United Nations had adopted twelve thematic multilateral anti-terrorism conventions prohibiting different manifestations of terrorism, such as hijacking, terrorist bombing, or hostage-taking. These are the crimes incorporated by reference in the Article 2(a) definition above.  This patchwork approach reflected the fact that states could not agree on an omnibus definition of terrorism that might undergird a comprehensive convention against terrorism. A number of sticking points emerged as obstacles in this endeavor. Most importantly was the question of whether violent acts committed against privileged combatants representing a state by unprivileged combatants representing a non-state armed group constitute terrorism. Such acts are not considered war crimes by international humanitarian law (a.k.a. the law of armed conflict), so if they were to be prohibited by international law it would have to be under a different basis. This controversy first arose with respect to national liberation movements, such as the fight against apartheid (think: “One man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter”). Today, this question arises in many of the cases before U.S. military commissions that involve acts of violence against U.S. military personnel. Another obstacle to the emergence of a comprehensive definition of terrorism is a lack of consensus about whether there is such a concept of state terrorism.  The Financing Convention actually came close to a comprehensive definition of terrorism when it prohibited the donation or collection of funds to support  [a]ny other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury … when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.  Eleven days post-9/11, the UN Security Council with UNSCR 1373 rendered the suite of terrorism treaties binding on all states, even non-signatories. In particular, this Chapter VII resolution mandated that “all States shall . . . [p]revent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts.” UNSCR 1373 also set up a monitoring process that obliged states to report within 90 days how they planned to comply with UNSCR 1373.  Given that the Convention is well-subscribed to and that its prohibitions now apply to all states by virtue of their UN Charter obligations, U.S. courts should have no trouble concluding that acts of terrorism also violate customary international law. I took up this question in this article, which argues that the prohibition against terrorism is now sufficiently defined and universal to satisfy the Supreme Court’s test in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. This question is not before the Supreme Court in Jesner, but may arise on remand.

Carel	Steve Head	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26367166	Published  Criminal gangs who trick people into investing in worthless shares have been targeted by police in the biggest ever international crackdown on the fraud.  The operation resulted in 110 arrests - mostly in Spain and the UK.  Police targeted the masterminds and facilitators of the "boiler room" fraud - so-called because of the cramped conditions they work from.  There are 850 confirmed victims of the gangs in the UK, but the real figure is likely to be in the "multi-thousands".  Detectives say the aim of the two-year investigation, codenamed Operation Rico, is to "decimate" boiler room fraud in Europe.  They believe it is the biggest ever operation against the crime.  Operation Rico, which culminated in a series of raids this week, was led by City of London Police.  Commander Steve Head, who is the national economic crime co-ordinator, said: "It is our most important investigation ever, targeting people we believe are at the top of an organised crime network that has been facilitating boiler rooms across Europe and which is suspected of being responsible for millions of pounds of investment fraud."  Among those under investigation were 10 "tier one criminals" with alleged links to organised crime and drugs, detectives said. Nine of them are British; one is South African.  The operation - supported by Spanish police - involved the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Secret Service.  "This is a landmark both from an investigative perspective and in terms of our close working partnership with other law enforcement agencies, most notably the Policía Nacional," said Commander Head.  Eighty-four arrests were made in Spain - where most of the boiler rooms are believed to be based - in raids involving 300 police officers, 40 of them from the UK.  Twenty people were detained in Britain, two in the US, four in Serbia.  Police released photographs of a Ferrari and a Ford Mustang seized in Marbella, and an Aston Martin recovered in Barcelona.  Detective Inspector James Clancey, from City of London Police, who was based in Spain for the operation, said: "This is us seeking to decimate a crime type."  Police say victims of the boiler room gangs have lost sums ranging from £2,000 to £500,000.  Those who are targeted are usually vulnerable or have a history of share investment, particularly in privatised utilities in the 1980s and 90s.  Most of them are aged 40 and over, with many in their 70s and 80s. Police say some killed themselves because of the financial problems they got into.  Fraudsters cold-call their victims, applying "high-pressure sales techniques" and "confidence tricks" to persuade them to part with their money.  They are offered returns of 10 to 20% per year, directed to authentic-looking websites and glossy brochures and asked to invest in bonds in well-known firms or in other companies that are officially registered.  Initially, they may receive "dividends" to give them confidence their investment is paying off but never receive any more or get their money back.  One of the victims, a woman in her late 70s, invested £23,000 in carbon credits.  She was then persuaded by another salesman to borrow money to buy £140,000 of shares in gold. She never recovered the money.  "I foolishly trusted him," she told BBC News, adding: "My generation is not very streetwise - because we never had to be."  Another victim, a 72-year-old man from the Midlands, said he and his wife had been "scammed out of our entire life savings".  He said that, in the weeks after realising what had happened, "we hardly slept or ate".  "It is still very raw to us both and we both have bad days when it is all we can think about," he added.  The Financial Conduct Authority has estimated that as much as £200m is lost to boiler room frauds in Britain every year.  The biggest individual loss recorded by police was £6 million.  Officers say the fraudsters spend their proceeds on Rolex watches, Armani suits, fast cars and flashy apartments.  Some are involved in drug dealing and attend drugs parties.  Avoiding detection  Each boiler room network is believed to have an accountant, money launderer and lawyer, as well as people who do the "sales".  These tend to be university students or travellers who speak English, including some from Scandinavia, who have answered adverts for salespeople.  They use false names and build up a "legend" - a cover story and false history.  "They're young people who want to earn good commission and want to drink themselves into the ground," said DI Clancey.  Operation Rico is the first time there has been a multi-agency and cross-border investigation against different networks of boiler room fraudsters. Previously there was more of a piecemeal approach.  However, despite some successes, criminals had become adept at avoiding detection by frequently moving offices and wiping computers.  DI Clancey said the Spanish authorities were fully behind the operation. "The Spanish want to drive it out of Spain - it's tainting them," he said.  Detectives acknowledge that boiler room fraudsters will not disappear but they are more likely to operate in future in the more "hostile" environments of Thailand, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.

Nine of them are British; one is South African.\n\nThe operation - supported by Spanish police - involved the UK\'s National Crime Agency and the US Secret Service.\n\n"This is a landmark both from an investigative perspective and in terms of our close working partnership with other law enforcement agencies, most notably the Policía Nacional," said Commander Head.\n\nEighty-four arrests were made in Spain - where most of the boiler rooms are believed to be based - in raids involving 300 police officers, 40 of them from the UK.\n\nTwenty people were detained in Britain, two in the US, four in Serbia.\n\nPolice released photographs of a Ferrari and a Ford Mustang seized in Marbella, and an Aston Martin recovered in Barcelona.\n\nDetective Inspector James Clancey, from City of London Police, who was based in Spain for the operation, said: "This is us seeking to decimate a crime type."\n\nPolice say victims of the boiler room gangs have lost sums ranging from £2,000 to £500,000.\n\nThose who are targeted are usually vulnerable or have a history of share investment, particularly in privatised utilities in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nMost of them are aged 40 and over, with many in their 70s and 80s. Police say some killed themselves because of the financial problems they got into.\n\nFraudsters cold-call their victims, applying "high-pressure sales techniques" and "confidence tricks" to persuade them to part with their money.\n\nThey are offered returns of 10 to 20% per year, directed to authentic-looking websites and glossy brochures and asked to invest in bonds in well-known firms or in other companies that are officially registered.\n\nInitially, they may receive "dividends" to give them confidence their investment is paying off but never receive any more or get their money back.\n\nOne of the victims, a woman in her late 70s, invested £23,000 in carbon credits.\n\nShe was then persuaded by another salesman to borrow money to buy £140,000 of shares in gold. She never recovered the money.\n\n"I foolishly trusted him," she told BBC News, adding: "My generation is not very streetwise - because we never had to be."\n\nAnother victim, a 72-year-old man from the Midlands, said he and his wife had been "scammed out of our entire life savings".\n\nHe said that, in the weeks after realising what had happened, "we hardly slept or ate".\n\n"It is still very raw to us both and we both have bad days when it is all we can think about," he added.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has estimated that as much as £200m is lost to boiler room frauds in Britain every year.\n\nThe biggest individual loss recorded by police was £6 million.\n\nOfficers say the fraudsters spend their proceeds on Rolex watches, Armani suits, fast cars and flashy apartments.\n\nSome are involved in drug dealing and attend drugs parties.\n\nAvoiding detection\n\nEach boiler room network is believed to have an accountant, money launderer and lawyer, as well as people who do the "sales".\n\nThese tend to be university students or travellers who speak English, including some from Scandinavia, who have answered adverts for salespeople.\n\nThey use false names and build up a "legend" - a cover story and false history.\n\n"They\'re young people who want to earn good commission and want to drink themselves into the ground," said DI Clancey.\n\nOperation Rico is the first time there has been a multi-agency and cross-border investigation against different networks of boiler room fraudsters.

Shakshi	Syrian Army	Individual	https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/03/26/efficiency-of-syrian-armed-forces-analysis-of-russian-assistance-pub-81150	The conflict in Syria is far from over, and Bashar al-Assad’s regime now faces the difficult task of organizing its forces to win the war and ensure the peace afterward. Further consolidation of Syrian sovereignty may cause a new wave of full-scale hostilities. Even if the regime fully controls Syrian territory, there will be a long period of internal instability with the risk of another uprising and regional separatism. Therefore, the development of the army remains a high priority for the Syrian government and its allies. The current poor state of the country’s armed forces is a result of hurried, ad-hoc steps during the war for survival, but a pause in hostilities makes it possible to streamline and reform the armed forces. The main issue remains choosing whether the Syrian armed forces (SAF) will focus more on conventional operations or internal security.  Russia can be a key player in the future of Syrian forces. The Russian command has already experimented with reforming the Syrian army, forming new large-scale, quasi-regular units and integrating various irregular and rebel groups into these units. It is difficult to expect the restoration of the prewar army, which was orientated to full-scale conventional war with external opponents.  The realities of the Syrian conflict make an internal security force a more likely option for reform. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, such a restoration would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. Apart from the lack of money, the shortage of manpower has been a critical issue for several years already. The Russian experience in Syria demonstrates that the main challenges facing SAF postwar reform are unit organization and effectiveness, force structure, and the integration of former rebels.  Russian Impressions on the State of the Syrian Army  In 2015, when planning to intervene in the Syrian civil war, Russian political leaders expected a quick victory. They thought that with the support of the Russian Air Force, the Syrian army and auxiliary progovernment forces would quickly turn the tide on the ground and regain the country’s territory. The whole active operation was conceived to be only for three to four months. Therefore, initially, no plans for large-scale Syrian military modernization were made. This clearly demonstrates insufficient Russian familiarity with the situation on the ground, despite the fact that Russia supported the regime from the very beginning of the civil war.  Like other external powers involved in Syria, Russia quickly realized that air strikes alone were not enough for success on the ground. According to the first commander of Russian military forces in Syria, colonel general Alexander Dvornikov, “by the summer of 2015, the Syrian armed forces had completely exhausted themselves, the personnel were demoralized, the officer corps degraded, and the armed forces showed extremely low efficiency in command and control.”  Victory could only be achieved by seriously improving the SAF or by creating new friendly forces. Russia is experienced in forming small, friendly armed forces. Over the past thirty years, the Russians have participated in the creation of quasi-regular military formations in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. In recent years, with the support of Russia, two bigger military forces were formed from scratch in separatist regions of Ukraine. These are heavy formations numbering tens of thousands of fighters equipped with hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-aircraft complexes, and drones. At the same time, modern Russia has little experience interacting with irregular formations. It is not surprising that in Syria, Russia chose to work with the regular army, leaving irregulars to Iranian influence.  The Russian military and political leadership have not officially announced plans for the future development of the Syrian army, but Russia began to participate in its improvement even before it entered the war in September 2015. After the official start of the intervention, these efforts grew significantly in scale. They suggest how Russia sees the future of the Syrian army.  First Attempt at Modernization: 4th Corps  The first Russian attempt to modernize Syrian forces was the creation of the 4th Assault Corps, which began shortly before the start of the Russian Air Force operation in September 2015. This modernization was mostly administrative. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a diverse mix from the 2nd Infantry Division, the 103rd Republican Guard Brigade, the 1st Assault Brigade, the 48th, the 53rd Special Purpose Regiment, and the Marines Battalion become part of the new formation under the control of a new headquarters in Latakia. New units created from National Defence Force irregulars and conscripts from Latakia were also included. Eventually, the 4th Corps contained more than twenty separate assault groups of about one hundred soldiers each. Thus, the entire “corps” barely exceeded 2,000 frontline fighters and did not reach the strength of a full-fledged division.  Russia also helped with the repair of 4th Corps’ heavy military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers. Recruits also received quick and basic combat training from Russian military advisers. Nonetheless, there was no sizable Russian investment in this corps, particularly in small scale equipment. The main added value was supposed to be better command and control. Senior Russian officers were assigned as advisers to the corps and units headquarters, and helped manage operations and coordination with Russian air forces.  The first offensive operation of 4th Corps began on October 8, 2015, just a week after the start of the Russian intervention. Assault groups were sent to al-Ghab Plain and the mountainous region of Latakia to remove the threat to the province and the Russian air base there. Intense Russian air strikes and cruise missile attacks supported the corps offensive. The recapture of the mountainous region of the province of Latakia took six months, while Ghab Plain is yet to be controlled by Damascus.  Even though the Ghab/Latakia operation did not meet with complete success, some of the experience gained in Russia-Syria military interaction quickly spread to other parts of the country. Advisers from senior ranks of the Russian army were appointed to nearly every battalion, brigade, and division of the regular government army. The Russian military and state-hired private military contractors also worked with some quasi-regular formations, such as the elite Tiger Forces.  The Russian Ministry of Defense admits that sometimes Russian advisers played a more active role than it had planned. After the death of the commander of the 124th brigade of the Republican Guard in May 2017, the unit was effectively run by a Russian adviser for a week, until a Syrian replacement was sent. Russia thus assessed that reorganization based on existing units with minimal investments would be ineffective, and their combat value would be insufficient. Problems arose not only with the command and control structure but also with the motivation of the troops, their training, and combat effectiveness. Therefore, Russia decided to spend much more attention and resources on creating a new 5th Volunteer Assault Corps, also known in Syria as the 5th Legion.  A Model for the Future? 5th Corps  From November 2016, a much more ambitious attempt to create a new combat-ready unit of the Syrian army began. Even though the assault on East Aleppo had ended successfully by that time, it was obvious to the Russian command that the existing progovernment forces, regular and irregular alike, were still extremely ineffective.  The new 5th Corps was composed completely of volunteers, to avoid the typical conscript challenges with desertion and insufficient motivation. Fighters received 200–300 U.S. dollars per month, which is quite an attractive salary in war-ravaged Syria. It is not known where the funds for the financing of the corps came from, but apparently Russia is one of the primary sources of weapons, equipment, and combat vehicles for the corps. Personnel received basic training from Russian instructors, as well as more prolonged and extensive tactical training.  Due to the lack of human resources, the 5th Corps composition became mixed. It brought together units of very different origins and motivations, mostly former irregular units outside the military command structure, such as the National Defense Forces or loyal Baath Battalions. Additional units were formed by recruiting new volunteers and demobilized veterans. Dedicated recruitment centers for the 5th Corps were created all over Syria, including in Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Tartus, Latakia, and Sweida. In 2018 former rebels from Daraa Province were also recruited into the 5th Corps.  Initially, the Russian military not only advised Syrian commanders but was in total command of the new corps at operational and tactical levels, which was necessary to break the problem of the rotten Syrian command and control structure. As Syrian personnel have gained more combat experience, the situation has shifted toward Russian advisers having less power in the 5th Corps.  An important difference from the typical Russian or Ukrainian separatist army corps was the almost complete absence of corps-level support units. In the regular army, the corps would have numerous artillery, missile, air defense brigades and regiments, and specialized support battalions, trained to fight together. The 5th Assault Corps remained organized as mostly independent infantry units, united by a joint command. Only a few select units received additional heavy weapons, but unlike for the 4th Corps these were not only outdated tanks. In addition to the old T-62M, these select 5th Corps units received upgraded T-72B3 tanks and T-90A tanks, which are purchased even today by the Russian army.  The newly created militia and irregular units, including those in the 5th Corps, are already being equipped with machine guns and pickup trucks mounted with automatic cannons. Attached artillery include multiple rocket launchers installed on the same automobile chassis. Such formations are seriously inferior in combat effectiveness to mechanized infantry, but because of their low price, they are the most affordable option for creating and re-forming future regular military units.  Despite this, challenges remain. The 5th Corps remains unstructured. While the total number of fighters in the corps is difficult to estimate, it probably exceeds 10,000 people. For Syria, the formation of such a large and relatively “heavy” military unit from scratch is a great achievement.The practice has shown that this corps project was more successful than with the 4th Corps. The 5th Corps was used to storm Palmyra, to establish control over the Syrian desert, to de-blockade Deir Ezzor and to capture the Euphrates valley and Daraa. In March 2019, the corps, almost in full composition, was sent to prepare for the attack on opposition-held Idlib Province.  The Russian military command highly praised the effectiveness of the 5th Corps. Especially noteworthy was the fact that the all-volunteer and relatively well-paid structure was sufficiently loyal to be used not just regionally, but all over the country. In terms of mobility, the 5th Corps has caught up with the most combat-ready Syrian units, such as the 4th Armored Division and elite Tiger Forces. Still, an important issue is whether this corps and its followers will remain relatively light in composition or later receive additional heavy military equipment and a more heavy structure? Today such a structure is compensated by the Russian air power, but self-sufficiency may require heavier native firepower.  Future Structure: Heavy or Light?  It is difficult to expect the restoration of the heavy prewar army, oriented for full-scale conventional war with external opponents. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, it would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. There is no way for Syria to restore the previous number of tanks and armored vehicles, aircraft, and air defense systems available before the war. Their only source can be Russia. But so far no plans for large-scale procurements have been announced, and those that took place were limited. This is especially true for sophisticated modern weapons.  The only significant supply of S-300 air defense systems was a situational reaction by Russia to the loss of an IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft to the friendly fire of Syrian air defense weapons. There has been no full restoration or a serious buildup of the country’s air defense forces to a level capable of effectively protecting it from Israel and the United States. There have been no purchases and deliveries of new aircraft, either fixed or rotary wing. In the near future, Syria can expect only a small delivery of transport helicopters vital for supporting the mobility of the Syrian army.  The experience of supplying advanced tanks to Syrian forces was not very successful. The crews that lacked sufficient training used them with the same tactics as the ancient T-55 and T-72 models without much effect on the battlefield. Vital to the war effort was Russian assistance in the restoration of armored vehicles. More than 1,100 tons of spare parts for armored vehicles were transferred to Syria. Russia helped to set up the Homs tank repair/overhaul facility and smaller repair shops in Jabla and Latakia. In 2015–2017, they repaired 3,572 armored vehicles and another 1,244 in 2018. Such a high level of support allowed the country’s land forces to maintain some armored combat capability over the years, despite heavy losses.  Russia was also generous with the supply of heavy infantry weapons, such as 23mm ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, large-caliber machine guns, and Kornet anti-tank systems, which are also used as multipurpose support weapons. Anti-tank guided missiles played an increasing role in Syrian ground force action and gave the the SAF a necessary technical edge over rebel forces. Such infantry weapons are not only cheaper, but easier to master, and they are ideal for the tactics of small and quasi-regular units. Still, mass training and retaining high-quality officers and soldiers capable of operating sophisticated modern weapons is a challenging task for modern Syria. This is a severe limiting factor in the restoration of a heavy army.  The Problem of Integrating Former Rebels Units  The reinstatement of government control over vast swaths of territory in 2018 and numerous supposed reconciliation deals with former rebel regions have given the government an important source of personnel to rebuild Syrian regular forces. Nonetheless, there is no indication that the Syrian government has developed a unified approach to the reintegration of former rebels into national armed forces.  The regime prefers to pursue a policy of disarming surrendering rebel units, then dissolving them and recruiting individual fighters. Such an approach makes former rebels a dormant source of much-needed manpower. For many surrendering rebels, service in the army or auxiliary troops remains the only way to make a living and to avoid political persecution.  In addition to the apparent doubts about questionable loyalty of large ex-rebel contingents, their weapons and equipment are not in line with those of progovernment forces, which makes supply difficult. Fighters have mixed levels of training, and many do not have any. As a result, reconciled units, in general, do not represent a coherent and combat-worthy force useful for induction into the army and would require a complete overhaul anyway.  There are only a few examples of small rebel formations of company and battalion size that transferred to serve and fight in Syrian auxiliary units as a whole. Russia also showed flexibility in making local, temporary alliances with nongovernment forces like tribal militia units in the valley of the Euphrates River and YPG factions of Syrian Democratic Forces there. In the final stages of the defeat of the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Syria in December 2017, Russian officers and soldiers of Special Operations Forces were sent to these YPG factions as military advisers. The Russian Air Force provided close air support for the advancing Kurds. A joint headquarters was created to coordinate the actions of Russia and the militias of the Euphrates valley.  However, this was an exception to the rule, and there is no reason to expect that this approach will change concerning rebels forces in Idlib and At-Tanf. Here the government will likely prefer to disband local forces even if they manage to reach a peace agreement with them. Given the long history of armed hostility and the large number of radical Islamists in their ranks, the reliability and loyalty of such units will be always questionable.  The future of forces in the territories now under Turkish control will depend entirely on the conditions of a political settlement. But after Operation Peace Spring, it is clear that Turkey is not going to leave Syria. Of the former rebels there, Turkey formed a well-organized proxy, the Syrian National Army. It is difficult to imagine that these units, which are completely loyal and controlled by a hostile foreign state, can be somehow integrated into the Syrian armed forces, even in the long term.  The situation is different in the SDF-controlled region of the country. The Turkish operation Source of Peace in October 2019 pushed the Kurds toward reconciliation with the central government. The Syrian armed forces are now peacefully deployed on a substantial amount of SDF territories. The Syrian Ministry of Defense announced its readiness to integrate SDF troops into the regular army. The SDF General Command cautiously announced its readiness for such a step in the future, but not before a full political settlement between the Kurdish regions and the central government of the country. Such rapprochement is definitely possible, given the low level of hostility between the parties throughout the conflict.  Inevitably, the question of the fate of the SDF’s well-organized and battle-hardened forces will arise. Dissolving Kurdish units and subsequently conscripting individual fighters would be ineffective. The regime must find another way to integrate them into the military, while striking a delicate balance between the autonomy of SDF units and their subordination to central command.  One method to strike this balance could be through government-run headquarters of divisions or army corps. The existing SDF brigades and battalions could be subordinated to these headquarters, which would lead on operational control and planning, personnel, supply, and logistical management and financing.  Conclusion  Russia does not plan to recreate the Syrian army in its prewar form. Modern Syria is not able to pay for this, and other allies cannot sponsor it. The ultimate goal of Russia is to create a self-sufficient SAF that will be able to maintain the unity and internal stability of the country without direct military assistance. Such a goal well coincides with the interests of the Syrian regime and will provide an exit strategy for Russia.  Russian plans to unite forces under a single command are in direct conflict with the interests of Iran, which Syria relies on for an extensive network of loyal yet irregular formations. These units are financed by Iran and are therefore more faithful to Tehran than Damascus. The final word on the composition of the regular army will still be with Russia, and it is unlikely that Russia is ready to yield to Iran in this matter. A tightly integrated vertical command structure is a critical element of Russian military strategy.  In any case, the mobile armored fist of the few elite mechanized units will remain. Its presence is necessary not only for the rapid concentration and unity of forces but also for reasons of national pride. The model tested in the 5th Corps offers a cost-effective way of organizing a mix of many different small units into larger, better-managed military structures. Unifying the chain of command is necessary to transform irregular units into regular and quasi-regular status. Such a structure would allow, if necessary, the easy integration of opposition units, including the SDF because their organization, tactics, and weapons are not very different from those of the SAF.  A serious challenge for the Syrian regime will be the need to establish its own effective command and control structure after the departure of Russian advisers. Also, it will not be easy to find financing to motivate the whole army the same way as the 5th Corps. The armament of the Syrian armed forces will consist almost exclusively of outdated equipment for the foreseeable future. From pure necessity, the government must concentrate on resources already on the ground. Significant development of the Syrian air, air defense, and naval forces is not a priority.  The Syrian army should be sufficient to suppress local uprisings and maintain the integrity of the country. At the same time, in this context the SAF would not pose a serious threat to neighbors, including Israel and Turkey. Since Russia is trying to maintain good relations with regional powers, this is a crucial deciding factor.  The main problem for the regime remains the loyalty of the renewed army. At the beginning of the conflict, entire military units changed sides. In recent years, Assad has been able to stop such cases by combining better material rewards, building patriotism among the people, and using brutal repression. If a large number of former antagonists were to be included in the army, even these means might not be enough, so maintaining the loyalty and stability of the armed forces will always remain a headache.  In the more distant future, after establishing lasting peace in the country, the structure of the army may change again. Given the nation’s decades of history of employing heavy mechanized military units, the SAF will inevitably gravitate to a heavier regular structure. Still, such a prospect will require significant strengthening of the economy and the political stability of the regime and is not even on the horizon.		random	The help from Russia for syrian forces	Wanting		The Efficiency of the Syrian Armed Forces: An Analysis of Russian Assistance
Carel	IBM	Organization	https://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/ibm-patents-browser-based-fraud-detection-technology.html	A user's online actions and behaviors inside of a browser can help define who they are. That's the basis of a new patent from IBM researchers designed to help limit the risk of e-commerce fraud.  "At a high-level what we have patented is the ability to help prevent fraudulent transactions before they occur," IBM Master Inventor Brian O'Connell told eSecurityPlanet. "We look at a lot of Web browser metrics that we transmit to a server on the backend and before a transaction takes place. We compare the transaction to a profile based on previous interactions from the user with the website."  Twist on Two-factor Authentication  Based on an existing profile, it is possible to make a determination on whether or not the transaction is legitimate, O'Connell explained. The system is fundamentally a form of two-factor authentication for users, he added.  The user behavior that IBM examines involves a number of different attributes. Those attributes include how long a user typically hovers their mouse over a link before it is clicked, how a user scrolls through a page, and whether he uses the page-up/page-down keyboard buttons or just the mouse wheel.  "By measuring the attributes we are able to determine how likely a person is who they say they are," O'Connell said.  In a two-factor system, a user needs a second password (or factor) in order to gain access to a site or service. With IBM's invention, that second factor is the user's own browser behavior. In other forms of two-factor authentication, the user is typically aware of the factor being used, explained IBM Master Inventor Keith Walker.  "In this case, people are exhibiting behaviors as they interact with a Web page entirely subconsciously," Walker said.  Fraud detection systems have long leveraged anomalous behavior to help identify potential fraud. Noticing if a user is making a transaction from a different location than normal is a common fraud detection tactic today. The IBM patent is complementary to the traditional approach to fraud detection, Walker said.  More Patents on the Way  "In our patent we do reference current technology, so if a user is making a transaction and it's 3 a.m. and it's atypical for them, then that is an indication fraud might be going on," Walker said. "All this technology can work together."  Walker and O'Connell originally filed the patent for a "user-browser interaction-based fraud detection system" in April of 2006. U.S. Patent #8,650,080 was officially granted in February of this year, though IBM is only now officially announcing the patent. Walker noted that the time it takes for patents to be granted varies and is beyond his control. That said, he added that parts of the invention are now found inside IBM's Trusteer Pinpoint technology.  IBM has many more inventions that are patent pending to further mitigate the risks of online fraud. Walker noted that there is a patent in the system now related to fraud detection on mobile devices, for example.  "We took the concept of user behavior detection and thought through how to implement the invention in a keyboard-less touchscreen interface, where user behavior is very different than on a keyboard," Walker said.

We compare the transaction to a profile based on previous interactions from the user with the website."\n\nTwist on Two-factor Authentication\n\nBased on an existing profile, it is possible to make a determination on whether or not the transaction is legitimate, O\'Connell explained. The system is fundamentally a form of two-factor authentication for users, he added.\n\nThe user behavior that IBM examines involves a number of different attributes. Those attributes include how long a user typically hovers their mouse over a link before it is clicked, how a user scrolls through a page, and whether he uses the page-up/page-down keyboard buttons or just the mouse wheel.\n\n"By measuring the attributes we are able to determine how likely a person is who they say they are," O\'Connell said.\n\nIn a two-factor system, a user needs a second password (or factor) in order to gain access to a site or service. With IBM\'s invention, that second factor is the user\'s own browser behavior. In other forms of two-factor authentication, the user is typically aware of the factor being used, explained IBM Master Inventor Keith Walker.\n\n"In this case, people are exhibiting behaviors as they interact with a Web page entirely subconsciously," Walker said.\n\nFraud detection systems have long leveraged anomalous behavior to help identify potential fraud. Noticing if a user is making a transaction from a different location than normal is a common fraud detection tactic today. The IBM patent is complementary to the traditional approach to fraud detection, Walker said.\n\nMore Patents on the Way\n\n"In our patent we do reference current technology, so if a user is making a transaction and it\'s 3 a.m. and it\'s atypical for them, then that is an indication fraud might be going on," Walker said. "All this technology can work together."\n\nWalker and O\'Connell originally filed the patent for a "user-browser interaction-based fraud detection system" in April of 2006. U.S. Patent #8,650,080 was officially granted in February of this year, though IBM is only now officially announcing the patent. Walker noted that the time it takes for patents to be granted varies and is beyond his control. That said, he added that parts of the invention are now found inside IBM\'s Trusteer Pinpoint technology.\n\nIBM has many more inventions that are patent pending to further mitigate the risks of online fraud.

Carel	Ahmed Saeed Hussain Khalil	Individual	https://egyptindependent.com/sisi-s-brother-head-unit-combating-terrorist-financing/	The eldest brother of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been appointed to head a government body responsible for investigating the funding of terrorist activities, including illegal money-laundering activities.  Ahmed Saeed Hussain Khalil was appointed to the job in a decree issued on Sunday by Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, along with several other members of the board of trustees.  The Unit for Combatting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, which was founded in 2002, is authorized to access bank accounts in seeking to prevent money laundering that supports terrorism.  As a senior judge, Sisi's brother is already deputy head of the Court of Cassation, and has experience in dealing with financial issues related to trade and banking. In Sunday's decree, he was named Ahmed Saeed Hussain Khalil, the name is normally uses for professional purposes, although his full name includes the family name "al-Sisi".  Other members of the board named in the decree include: deputy governor of Central Bank of Egypt Gamal Abdel Aziz; head of Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority Sherif Samir Sami; deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak; and representatives of the general prosecution and the Federation of Egyptian Banks.  Sunday's announcement has been criticized by some, due to the close family relationship between the unit's new head and the president of Egypt. In addition, some have questioned the failure of the decree to make mention of the Sisi family name in announcing the appointment.  "The decree itself is not something new, but choosing [judge] Sisi to head the unit raises lots of questions," a source at the Court of Cassation told Al-Masry Al-Youm.  "The unit has been headed for years, since the rule of toppled president Hosni Mubarak, by Serry Siam, the former president of the Court of Cassation and former head of the Supreme Judicial Council. But nobody is aware of what it has accomplished during those years," said the anonymous source.  "Now, after all these years, it is to be presided over by a judge from the top judicial body in the country, who is the brother of president!"  Meanwhile, another source close to judge Sisi said that he is well qualified to head the unit, since he has experience in trade disputes, which relates to the unit's focus on banking and financial issues.  The source described judge Sisi as affirmative and strong, focused on his own professional responsiblitities, never seeking to benefit from his brother's name in the context of his work.  According to judicial sources, the Court of Cassation approved the new appointment at the request of the Cabinet. The appointment lasts for two years.

Carel	Ruan Lingyu	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171025-ruan-lingyu-the-greta-garbo-of-china	Tens of thousands bid farewell to the silent screen goddess at her funeral, which was dubbed “the most spectacular funeral of the century” by The New York Times. Film historian Mark Cousins wrote in Prospect that the procession through Shanghai was three miles (4.8 km) long, and during the march three other women committed suicide, so overcome were they by their grief for Ruan. The funeral was far beyond even that for Rudolph Valentino, the Hollywood silent film star whose death in 1926 only heightened his romantic appeal.  But in 2001, two other versions of Ruan’s suicide note surfaced. In one of the notes, the late actress blamed the womaniser tycoon Tang for mistreating her and breaking her heart, while accusing Zhang of his malicious act in shaming her publicly. There was great public speculation about which of these notes most got to the heart of ‘why she did it’ – in part because of the phenomenal success of Centre Stage and Maggie Cheung’s portrayal of Ruan. Cheung won the best actress prize at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1992 for her performance in Centre Stage, which the US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum named as the best film of the 1990s.  A couple of years later, in 1994, a stage drama about Ruan’s life was performed in Beijing – it was revived for another run in 2013. And the actress Jacklyn Wu Chien-lien would go on to portray Ruan in a Chinese TV series about her life that spanned 30 episodes.  The true cause for Ruan’s suicide remains a mystery. But regardless of the reasons for her untimely death, Ruan accomplished a great deal in her short life as the brightest star of early Chinese cinema. And with her education, modern style and portrayal of independent women onscreen – even if those women could sometimes be subject to abuse by men, as she was herself – she became an icon of China’s republican era, sealing her status as an immortal goddess in the hearts of modern day film buffs.

Carel	FCA	Organization	https://globalcompliancenews.com/uk-financial-crime-checklist-20161208/	On 21 November 2016 the FCA issued a booklet aimed at consumer credit firms setting out good and bad practice on compliance with obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLR). While directed at consumer credit firms, the booklet is, of course, relevant to all firms subject to the MLR.  AML Focus  Financial crime is one of seven regulatory priorities for the FCA according to its 2016/17 Business Plan. It also remains an area of enforcement focus with the FCA. Most recently, on 12 October 2016, the FCA fined Sonali Bank £3.25m for a series of money laundering systems and controls failings. The Bank’s MLRO was also fined and prohibited from holding the MLRO function and from performing any MLRO or compliance oversight function.  Risks  The risks posed to consumer credit firms differ from risks for other financial services firms. According to the JMLSG, in the consumer finance context the main money laundering risk arises from an acceleration in the repayment schedule whereby the borrower may seek to use tainted funds to repay borrowings and launder money in that way. Lenders also have to deal with fraud and identity theft issues which can also feed into money laundering concerns.  The Checklist  We set out below the key messages from the FCA together with recommendations on action that firms should take.  Risk Assessment Carry out a risk assessment proportionate to the nature and scale of your activities. The carrying out of risk assessments should be a continuous process. The suggestion in the FCA booklet is that too often these are regarded as one-off or annual exercises. However, firms need to conduct a regular review of risks.  Adequate resources should be focussed on areas of risk identified.  Policies and procedures Effective, up to date and accessible policies and procedures should be prepared. Polices and procedures should be reviewed and kept up to date. The practical application of policies and procedures should be reviewed/audited regularly to ensure that they are appropriately applied and implemented. This should also highlight whether changes should be made to existing policies and procedures. Governance Senior management must be fully engaged in oversight of financial crime matters and must be aware of the financial crime risks to which the firm is subject. They should also set the right tone from the top. Firms should ensure that senior management responsibility for financial crime risks is appropriately documented. This assists in demonstrating clarity around the allocation of responsibilities and assists in evidencing compliance.  Tone from the top can be a cliché. However, active “hands on” involvement by senior managers in dealing with financial crime issues will show that the issue is taken seriously across the organisation.  Senior management should receive management information on financial crime risks, including the output of risk assessments. Senior management involvement in financial crime issues should be documented, for example, through board minutes or minutes of other compliance committees or forums.  Staff Awareness Relevant financial crime training must be provided to staff in key roles. Monitoring and HR processes should ensure that staff compliance with financial crime requirements and processes is reviewed and any deficiencies addressed. The FCA cite as an example of good practice the monitoring of employees’ work to ensure that they have an understanding of risks relating to the firm. Data Security Firms must have written data security policies and appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure customer data is kept safe. Data security must not be treated as exclusively an IT or privacy issue, but financial crime risks must also be taken into account. Access to data should be limited to those who require access in order to perform their roles. From a governance perspective responsibility for data security should be allocated clearly. Beware when outsourcing that appropriate controls are put in place. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Where firms are subject to the Money Laundering Regulations they must establish and maintain systems and controls to reduce the risk that the may be used to handle the proceeds of crime. AML procedures should be risk based so that the same customer due diligence (CDD) procedures should not be applied across all customers and products. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Where there is a higher risk of money laundering, from certain clients such as PEPs or higher risk jurisdictions, firms must undertake EDD. Senior managers should be involved in approving higher risk customers and be aware of what additional checks are required. Ongoing monitoring / Suspicious Activity Reporting Firms must conduct on-going monitoring of their business relationships on a risk-sensitive basis. Firms should draw on the information they have about their customers and their activities with a view to detecting unusual or suspicious behaviour. Record-keeping The FCA requires retention of customer identity records for five years after the business relationship. Make sure that your firm’s policies and procedures reflect this requirement. Practically, it is also important that this information can be retrieved quickly and easily for compliance staff and also should the regulator ask to see it. Where reliance is placed on third parties make sure that they have adequate procedures as your business remains responsible.  Of all the above issues, there are two in respect of which firms should place special emphasis.  Governance  Governance: the accountability of senior managers to guard against financial crime is provided for under high level standards in the FCA Handbook in respect of systems and controls. In this regard, a firm must allocate to a director or senior manager (e.g. the money laundering reporting officer) overall responsibility. It is vital that proper reporting lines are in place and that information can reach management and relevant committees in a timely fashion for consideration and action, where necessary. With the roll out of the Senior Managers and Certified Persons Regime to all financial services firms in 2018, the incentive on managers to ensure that reasonable steps have been taken will be further increased.  Data Security  There is also the threat posed by cyber attacks and the corresponding need to ensure data security. The growing use of technology in delivering services to clients, the sheer amount of data and its nature makes cyber security a key issue. The Data Protection Act 1998 requires that information must be kept securely and protected against criminals who would, for instance, commit identity theft. Good data security policies and appropriate systems and controls are a necessity in ensuring that staff understand their responsibilities and in demonstrating compliance to regulators, including the Information Commission’s office with their growing penalty powers.

Carel	Rahul Pangam	Individual	https://www.eweek.com/security/simility-launches-fraud-detection-service	Rahul Pangam worked at Google for seven years focusing on reducing fraud, and now he's taken that expertise to his startup Simility. Pangam founded Simility with the goal of reducing online fraud via a combination of human data scientists and the right amount of machine learning.  Pangam, who is also CEO of Simility, started building the company in May 2014 with a number of fellow former Google engineers. The effort has culminated in the Simility platform, which became generally available on May 26.  To date, Simility has raised $7.2 million in venture funding from a number investors, including Accel and Trinity Ventures.  "At Google, we were instrumental in building and scaling up a lot of the abuse and fraud detection efforts across various products," Pangam told eWEEK. "At Google, we had the resources to build very sophisticated platforms, but what we realized is that the larger market had a real need for a better fraud prevention system."  The core technologies behind Simility are a mix of open-source and purpose-built proprietary code. Pangam explained that Simility makes use of the open-source Cassandra NoSQL database to help make decisions in real time on potential instances of fraud.  "We use open-source technology as much as we can and then on top build our proprietary machine learning models," Pangam said. "We focus on where we can make a big difference."  The key innovation for Simility, though, isn't its core technology but rather how it can be customized to fit specific use cases. For example, Pangam said that in an online travel business, understanding where a flight ticket is purchased and where a user is going has an impact on determining fraud. But for a gaming company, the metrics for understanding fraud are somewhat different, as it's important to understand how a user buys an in-game credit and how soon thereafter that credit used.  "Specific attributes can make a huge difference to differentiate between fraud and regular user behavior," he said. "We try to customize the model for specific customers."  The challenge of customization is that it can often require professional services. Simility tries to minimize the need for professional services with a step-by-step process that drives an automated technique to enable customization, Pangam said. From a deployment perspective, organizations tie into the Simility platform by way of a line of JavaScript or an integrated API. Simility makes use of cloud data centers around the world for its back-end infrastructure.  The market for fraud detection technologies is a competitive one, including such vendors as Experian and Equifax. Key differentiators for Simility, according to Pangam, are its customization capabilities and its use of hands-on data scientists to help customers. Customers get weekly consultations with a data scientist to help continuously adjust and improve the model in an effort to reduce fraud.  "We have built a hybrid approach that lets customers have a degree of policy control and not be entirely at the mercy of machine learning models," he said.

Pangam founded <a href="https://simility.com">Simility</a> with the goal of reducing online fraud via a combination of human data scientists and the right amount of machine learning.</p>\n\n<p>Pangam, who is also CEO of Simility, started building the company in May 2014 with a number of fellow former Google engineers. The effort has culminated in the Simility platform, which became generally available on May 26.</p>\n\n<p>To date, Simility has raised $7.2 million in venture funding from a number investors, including Accel and Trinity Ventures.</p>\n\n<p>"At Google, we were instrumental in building and scaling up a lot of the abuse and fraud detection efforts across various products," Pangam told <em>eWEEK</em>. "At Google, we had the resources to build very sophisticated platforms, but what we realized is that the larger market had a real need for a better fraud prevention system."</p>\n\n<p>The core technologies behind Simility are a mix of open-source and purpose-built proprietary code. Pangam explained that Simility makes use of the open-source Cassandra NoSQL database to help make decisions in real time on potential instances of fraud.</p>\n\n<p>"We use open-source technology as much as we can and then on top build our proprietary machine learning models," Pangam said. "We focus on where we can make a big difference."</p>\n\n<p>The key innovation for Simility, though, isn\'t its core technology but rather how it can be customized to fit specific use cases. For example, Pangam said that in an online travel business, understanding where a flight ticket is purchased and where a user is going has an impact on determining fraud. But for a gaming company, the metrics for understanding fraud are somewhat different, as it\'s important to understand how a user buys an in-game credit and how soon thereafter that credit used.</p>\n\n<p>"Specific attributes can make a huge difference to differentiate between fraud and regular user behavior," he said. "We try to customize the model for specific customers."</p>\n\n<p>The challenge of customization is that it can often require professional services. Simility tries to minimize the need for professional services with a step-by-step process that drives an automated technique to enable customization, Pangam said. From a deployment perspective, organizations tie into the Simility platform by way of a line of JavaScript or an integrated API.

Carel	Alison Heather	Individual	https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/99434993/professor-of-physiology-says-trans-athlete-has-advantage-in-speed-and-power	A New Zealand physiology professor says transgender athletes have advantages over their female competitors and more research needs to be done by sporting regulators before they should compete against each other.  Otago University professor in physiology Alison Heather has researched transgender changes, particularly in top level sport.  She is adamant international sporting regulation bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have rushed a decision to include transgender athletes in male and female categories, as there has not been enough research.  Heather says the controversial inclusion of Kiwi weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is a good example of the IOC not taking the time to research the science behind a transition.  "It could be seen as an advantage and that is why they have male categories and female categories."  Heather believes there is a potential muscle memory effect for Hubbard, having competed previously as a man.  She said the increased numbers of myonuclei (muscle fibres) could potentially allow Hubbard's muscles to train better than if she had not previously been a male.  "Also, whether hormone therapy has reduced the larger skeletal muscle fibre area of her previous male physique is questionable."  In 2015, the IOC changed their regulations to include trans women in the women's category of events if they remained under the testosterone levels of 10 nanomoles per litre (NMOL/L) a year prior to competing, as well as during competition.  However, a CIS female (a born female) can reach nowhere near the testosterone level of 10 NMOL/L. The average female sits at 2.8 NMOL/L and the average male 23-25 NMOL/L. This means the likes of Hubbard competes at three times the amount of testosterone to other weightlifting females.  "It hasn't been studied, but logical science will tell you someone who has three times more testosterone has the advantage physically. We need to do more research before arguing either way.  "I don't know what the solution is, but right now it is not fair on CIS females competing against transgender women."  Heather said not only can testosterone levels give trans women an advantage over their CIS female competitors, after transitioning a trans woman's muscle mass, lung capacity and muscle memory all remain the same as when they were CIS male. That could give the trans female athlete a possible advantage when competing in activities that involve physical strength.  "The physiological attributes of males that makes them naturally stronger including anatomical and biological features such as size, muscle mass, lung capacity, and heart size would be an advantage."  Heather said higher testosterone levels could give an athlete an advantage for power and speed sports.  "Higher testosterone levels could potentially have performance enhancing effects."  The IOC settled on a maximum level of 10 NMOL/L for trans female athletes - a level Heather deemed as set "without adequate research". "There has been very little research into elite male to female transgender athletes.  "Whether this normalising of hormone levels (and at 10 NMOL/L it is debatable whether they are normalised enough) removes the vast majority of the advantage of having been male is still an unanswered question."  Heather said there has been only one study of eight non-elite recreational runners who had transitioned from male to female, and their performance times were very similar. She said it was unfair to base restrictions and regulations on one study.  As current regulations sit with the IOC, there is also no restriction around the level of haemoglobin (increased haemoglobin increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood). Scientifically testosterone positively influences haemoglobin levels.  "Given the lack of research, there is a real need to study what physical advantages transgender females carry after hormone therapy with consideration required for different sports, trainability and for performance.  "Until then, it is very difficult to conclude that it is a level playing field for CIS women versus trans women."  The IOC based the 10NMOL regulation on the lower level of a CIS male of 10 NMOL/L - the upper range for a female is 3.1 NMOL/L.  At highest level, a CIS female with polycystic ovary syndrome can have up to two times or more higher levels of testosterone, meaning around 6 NMOL/L.  Disorders of sexual development (DSD) women have testosterone levels in the lower male range of around 10 NMOL/L, and this is another controversial point when competing at an international level of sport, says Heather.  In 2015, Indian athlete Dutee Chand challenged the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) in the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS).  The CAS ruled there was evidence that high testosterone levels do increase lean body mass, creating a competitive advantage and the IAAF must produce sufficient evidence about the relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance.  They suspended the 10 NMOLl/L ruling, and DSD women were allowed to compete without hormone therapy to lower testosterone levels.  Earlier this year, British Journal of Sports Medicine scientists Stephane Bermon and Pierre-Yves Garnier found there was statistically significant differences in the performance of higher testosterone female athletes versus lower testosterone athletes at the 2011 and 2013 International Athletics Federation World Championships across five separate events.  However there has been no change on the suspension of the 10 NMOL/L threshold for DSD athletes - but in the meantime, the new regulations for transgender women were set. Meaning trans gender athletes and DSD athletes are at odds also.  AT A GLANCE: Transgender athletes - Presently, they are allowed to compete with 3X higher testosterone levels than the high range CIS female. - Although there is no scientific evidence to support that this provides them with an advantage, it is known that testosterone (androgens) provide an advantage to females. - Increased endogenous androgens increase explosive performance. - Exogenous androgens can be used to enhance performance – increased power, strength and training capacity.

We need to do more research before arguing either way.</p>\n\n<p>"I\xa0don\'t\xa0know what the solution is, but right now it is not fair on CIS females competing against transgender women."</p>\n\n<p>Heather said not only can\xa0testosterone levels give trans women an advantage over their CIS female competitors, after transitioning a trans woman\'s muscle mass, lung capacity and muscle memory all remain the same as when they were CIS male. That could give\xa0the trans female athlete a possible advantage when competing in activities that involve physical strength.</p>\n\n<p>"The physiological attributes of males that makes them naturally stronger including anatomical and biological features such as size, muscle mass, lung capacity, and heart size would be an advantage."</p>\n\n<p>Heather said\xa0higher testosterone levels could give an athlete an advantage for power and speed sports.</p>\n\n<p>"Higher testosterone levels could potentially have performance enhancing effects."</p>\n\n<p>The IOC settled on a maximum level of 10 NMOL/L for trans female athletes - a level Heather deemed as set\xa0"without adequate research".<br> <br> "There has been very little research into elite male to female\xa0transgender athletes.</p>\n\n<p>"Whether this normalising of hormone levels (and at 10 NMOL/L it is debatable whether they are normalised enough) removes the vast majority of the advantage of having been male is still an unanswered question."</p>\n\n<p>Heather said there has been only one study of eight non-elite recreational runners who had transitioned from male to\xa0female, and their performance times were very similar. She said it was unfair to base restrictions and regulations on one study.</p>\n\n<p>As current regulations sit with the IOC, there is also no restriction around the level of haemoglobin\xa0(increased haemoglobin increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood). Scientifically\xa0testosterone positively influences haemoglobin levels.</p>\n\n<p>"Given the lack of research, there is a real need to study what physical advantages transgender females carry after hormone therapy with consideration required for different sports, trainability and for performance.</p>\n\n<p>"Until then, it is very difficult to conclude that it is a level playing field for CIS women versus trans women."</p>\n\n<p>The IOC based the 10NMOL regulation on the\xa0lower level of a CIS male of 10 NMOL/L - the upper range for a female is 3.1 NMOL/L.</p>\n\n<p>At highest level, a CIS female with polycystic ovary syndrome can have up to two times\xa0or more higher levels of testosterone, meaning around 6 NMOL/L.</p>\n\n<p>Disorders of sexual development (DSD) women have testosterone levels in the lower male range of around 10 NMOL/L, and this is another controversial point when competing at an international level of sport, says Heather.</p>\n\n<p>In\xa02015, Indian athlete Dutee Chand challenged\xa0the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) in\xa0the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS).</p>\n\n<p>The CAS ruled there was\xa0evidence that\xa0high testosterone levels do increase lean body mass, creating a competitive advantage and the\xa0IAAF must produce sufficient evidence about the\xa0relationship between enhanced testosterone\xa0levels and improved athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>They suspended the 10 NMOLl/L ruling, and DSD women were allowed to compete without hormone therapy to lower testosterone levels.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, British Journal of Sports Medicine scientists\xa0Stephane Bermon and Pierre-Yves Garnier\xa0found\xa0there was statistically\xa0significant differences in the performance of higher testosterone\xa0female athletes versus lower testosterone\xa0athletes at the 2011 and 2013 International Athletics Federation\xa0World Championships across five\xa0separate events.</p>\n\n<p>However there has been no change on the suspension of the 10 NMOL/L threshold for DSD athletes - but\xa0in the meantime, the new regulations for transgender women were set. Meaning trans gender athletes and DSD athletes are at odds also.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AT A GLANCE:</strong><br> Transgender athletes<br> - Presently, they are allowed to compete with 3X higher testosterone levels than the high range CIS\xa0female.\xa0<br> - Although there is no scientific evidence to support that this provides them with an advantage, it is known that testosterone (androgens) provide an advantage to females.\xa0<br> - Increased endogenous androgens increase explosive performance.<br> - Exogenous androgens can be used to enhance performance – increased power, strength and training capacity.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2017-12-02T18:35:38.023Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2017-12-02T01:40:00.806Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	transgender athletes' advantage in sports	Wanting		Professor of physiology says transgender athletes have advantage in speed, power
Carel	Mustafa al-Kadhimi	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-protests-basra/iraqi-forces-kill-protester-wound-40-in-southern-basra-security-rights-sources-idUSKBN27M2RJ	BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces killed at least one anti-government protester using live gunfire and wounded at least 40 others in the southern city of Basra on Friday, security sources and a rights official said.  It was the first killing of a protester by security forces in Basra since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office in May.  Iraq’s interior ministry confirmed the death but said in a statement that no Iraqi security forces were being allowed to use weapons against demonstrators and that it was investigating the incident.  Deadly flare-ups have been rare since protests against Iraq’s ruling elite and demanding jobs and services largely subsided earlier this year.  During months of anti-government protests that erupted under his predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi in October 2019, more than 500 people were killed, mostly young unarmed demonstrators.  The Basra security sources and rights official said several dozen protesters had taken to the streets in the country’s southern oil hub on Friday demanding jobs and basic services.  They were angry that Kadhimi had generally failed to deliver on both and that protest camps had been cleared by security force in Basra and Baghdad, the rights official said.  Kadhimi, who visited Basra on Thursday to tour energy projects and meet provincial officials, has pledged to protect non-violent Iraqi protesters and bring justice for the families of those killed last year by security forces and unidentified gunmen.  Security forces in Baghdad last month were ordered not to use live fire in dealing with protests to mark the anniversary of the 2019 demonstrations.

Shakshi	Sergio Mattarella	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Mattarella	Sergio Mattarella OMRI OMCA (Italian pronunciation: [ˈsɛrdʒo mattaˈrɛlla]; born 23 July 1941) is an Italian politician, jurist, academic and lawyer, who is serving as the 12th and current president of Italy since February 2015.  Mattarella was previously Minister for Parliamentary Relations from 1987 to 1989, Minister of Public Education from 1989 to 1990, Deputy Prime Minister of Italy from 1998 to 1999 and Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2001. In 2011, he became an elected judge on the Constitutional Court. On 31 January 2015, he was elected by the Italian Parliament to serve as President of the Italian Republic.  Early life[ edit ]  Sergio Mattarella with his father Bernardo, in 1963  Sergio Mattarella was born in Palermo, in a prominent Sicilian family. His father, Bernardo Mattarella, was an anti-fascist who, alongside Alcide De Gasperi and other prominent Catholic politicians, founded the Christian Democracy (DC), which dominated the Italian political scene for almost fifty years, with Bernardo serving as a minister several times; [1] while his mother, Maria Buccellato, came from an higher middle class family of Trapani. [2] [3]  During his youth, Mattarella moved to Rome, due to his father's commitments to politics. In Rome, he became a member of Catholic Action (AC), a large Catholic lay association, of which he became the regional chairman for Lazio from 1961 to 1964. [4]  After attending the classical lyceum San Leone Magno in Rome, [5] he studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he joined the Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI). [6] In 1964 he graduated with merit with the thesis The function of political direction. [7]  In 1967, he became a lawyer in Palermo, becoming particularly involved in administrative law. [8] After a few years, Mattarella started teaching parliamentary procedure at the University of Palermo, where he remained until 1983. His academic activity and publications had mainly concerned constitutional law topics, the intervention of the Sicilian Region in economy, bicameralism, legislative procedure, expropriation allowance, evolution of the Sicilian regional administration and controls on local authorities. [9]  In 1966, he married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, former rector of the University of Palermo, with whom he had three children: Laura, Francesco and Bernardo. [10]  Mattarella's parliamentary career began in 1983, when he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies in a left-leaning faction of the DC that had supported an agreement with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) led by Enrico Berlinguer, the so-called Historic Compromise. The following year he was entrusted by the Secretary of the Christian Democrat, Ciriaco De Mita, to "clean up" the Sicilian faction of the party from Mafia control, at a time when men of honour of Cosa Nostra like Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino were powerful political figures. [13] In 1985 Mattarella helped the young lawyer Leoluca Orlando, who had worked alongside his brother Piersanti during his governorship of Sicily, to become the new Mayor of Palermo.  Mattarella was appointed Minister for Parliamentary Affairs in the governments led by Christian Democratic Prime Ministers Giovanni Goria and Ciriaco De Mita, and in 1989 he became Minister of Public Education in the sixth cabinet of Giulio Andreotti. Mattarella stood down from his position, together with other ministers, in 1990 upon parliament's passing of the Mammì Act, liberalising the media sector in Italy, which they saw as a favour to the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. [14]  Sergio Mattarella in 1994  In 1990 Mattarella was appointed Vice-Secretary of Christian Democracy. He left the post two years later to become director of Il Popolo, the official newspaper of the party. Following the Italian referendum of 1993 he drafted the new electoral law nicknamed Mattarellum. [15] In 1994, when Christian Democracy was dissolved in the wake of the Tangentopoli corruption scandal, he helped found the Italian People's Party (PPI), along with its first leader Mino Martinazzoli and other former Christian Democrats. [14] In the ensuing 1994 general election (in which the newly founded PPI fared poorly) Martinazzoli was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies. [16] He soon found himself engaged in an internal dispute after the election of a new party leader, Rocco Buttiglione, who wished to steer the Italian People's Party towards an electoral alliance with Berlusconi's Forza Italia. [14] Following Buttiglione's appointment, Mattarella resigned as director of Il Popolo in opposition to this policy. [17]  Mattarella was one of the first supporters of the economist Romano Prodi at the head of the centre-left coalition known as The Olive Tree (L'Ulivo) in the 1996 general election. After the electoral victory of the centre-left, Mattarella served as President of the PPI's parliamentary group. Two years later, when Prodi's first government fell, Mattarella was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the government of Massimo D'Alema, then-leader of the Democrats of the Left (DS). As Minister of Defence, he supported the NATO Intervention in Yugoslavia against the Serbian President Slobodan Milošević; he also approved a reform of the Italian Armed Forces which abolished conscription. After the resignation of D'Alema in 2000, Mattarella kept his position as Minister of Defence in the government of Giuliano Amato. [14]  2000s[ edit ]  In October 2000 the PPI joined with other centrist parties to form an alliance called The Daisy (DL), later to merge into a single party in March 2002. Mattarella was re-elected to the Italian Parliament in the 2001 and 2006 general elections, standing as a candidate for The Daisy in two successive centre-left coalitions – The Olive Tree and The Union (L'Unione). [16]  In 2007 he was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD), a big tent centre-left party formed from a merger of left-wing and centrist parties which had been part of The Olive Tree, including The Daisy and the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the Italian Communist Party). [14]  On 5 October 2011 he was elected by the Italian Parliament with 572 votes to be a judge of the Constitutional Court. He was sworn in on 11 October 2011. He served until he was sworn in as President of the Italian Republic. [18] [16]  Main article: 2015 Italian presidential election  Sergio Mattarella with his predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano  On 31 January 2015 Mattarella was elected President of the Italian Republic at the fourth ballot with 665 votes out of 1,009, with support from the Democratic Party (PD), New Centre-Right (NCD), Civic Choice (SC), Union of the Centre (UDC) and Left Ecology Freedom (SEL). [19] [20]  Mattarella was officially endorsed by the Democratic Party after his name was put forward by the Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. [21] Mattarella replaced Giorgio Napolitano, who had served for nine years, the longest presidency in the history of the Italian Republic. However, since Napolitano had resigned on 14 January, Senate President Pietro Grasso was the Acting President at the time of Mattarella's inauguration on 3 February. Mattarella's first statement as new President was: "My thoughts go first and especially to the difficulties and hopes of our fellow citizens". [22] [23] [24]  His first presidential visit was on the day of his election, when he visited the Fosse Ardeatine where, in 1944 during World War II, the Nazi occupation troops killed 335 people as a reprisal for a partisan attack. Mattarella stated that "Europe and the world must be united to defeat whoever wants to drag us into a new age of terror". [25]  On 6 May 2015 Mattarella signed the new Italian electoral law, known as Italicum, which provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.  Mattarella and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, April 2017  On Sunday 4 December 2016, a constitutional referendum was held in Italy. [26] Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, [27] as well as the division of powers between the State, the regions, and administrative entities.  The bill, put forward by then- Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber), and, eventually, its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 (Senate) and 12 April 2016 (Chamber). [28]  In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution, a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one-fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, [29] since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote. [30] 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect. [31] This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic; the other two were in 2001 (in which the amending law was approved) and in 2006 (in which it was rejected).  The constitutional reform was rejected with almost 60% of votes, and on 7 December 2016, Prime Minister Renzi announced his resignation. On 11 December Mattarella appointed the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs Paolo Gentiloni as new head of the government. [32] [33]  2018 general election[ edit ]  Main articles: 2018 Italian general election and 2018 Italian government formation  The March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The election was seen as a backlash against the establishment with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League becoming the two largest parties in the Parliament. [34] [35]  After the election's results were known, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the M5S, and Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League, each urged that Mattarella should give him the task of forming a new cabinet because he led the largest party or coalition, respectively. [36] On 5 March, Matteo Renzi announced that the PD would be in the opposition during this legislature and that he would resign as party leader when a new cabinet was formed. [37] On 6 March, Salvini repeated his campaign message that his party would refuse any coalition with the Five Star Movement. [38] On 14 March, Salvini nonetheless offered to govern with the M5S, imposing the condition that League ally Forza Italia, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, must also take part in any coalition. Di Maio rejected this proposal on the grounds that Salvini was "choosing restoration instead of revolution" because "Berlusconi represents the past". [39] Moreover, a Five Star leader, Alessandro Di Battista, denied any possibility of an alliance with Forza Italia, describing Berlusconi as the "pure evil of our country". [40]  The consultations between Mattarella and the political parties on 4 and 5 April failed to result in a candidate for Prime Minister, forcing Mattarella to hold another round of consultation between 11 and 12 April 2018. [41]  On 18 April 2018 Mattarella tasked the President of the Senate, Elisabetta Casellati, with trying to reconcile the issues between the centre-right and the Five Star Movement, in order to break the post-election political deadlock and form a fully functional new government. [42] [43] However she failed to find a solution to the conflicts between the two groups, especially between the M5S and Forza Italia. [44] [45] On 23 April 2018, after Casellati's failure, Mattarella gave an exploratory mandate to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Roberto Fico, to try to create a political agreement between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party. [46] [47] [48] However, on 30 April, following an interview of the PD's former leader Matteo Renzi in which he expressed his strong opposition to an alliance with the M5S, Di Maio called for new elections. [49] [50] [51]  On 7 May, Mattarella held a third round of government formation talks, after which he formally confirmed the lack of any possible majority (M5S rejecting an alliance with the whole centre-right coalition, PD rejecting an alliance with both M5S and the centre-right coalition, and the League's Matteo Salvini refusing to form a government with M5S unless it included Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, whose presence in the government was explicitly vetoed by M5S's leader Luigi Di Maio); as a result, he announced his intention to soon appoint a "neutral government" (ignoring M5S and the League's refusal to support such an option) to take over from the Gentiloni Cabinet which was considered unable to lead Italy into a second consecutive election as it represented a majority from a past legislature and suggested an early election in July (which would be the very first summer general election in Italy) as an option in light of the ongoing deadlock. [52] The Lega and M5S agreed to hold new elections on 8 July, an option that was however rejected by all other parties. [53] [54] [55]  On 9 May, after a day of rumours, M5S and the League officially asked Mattarella to give them 24 more hours to strike a coalition agreement between the two parties. [56] Later the same day, in the evening, Silvio Berlusconi publicly announced that Forza Italia would not support an M5S-League government on a vote of confidence, but would nevertheless maintain the centre-right alliance, thus opening the door to a possible majority government between the two parties. [57] On 13 May, the Five Star Movement and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, likely clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but they could not agree regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the prime minister. M5S and League leaders met with Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government. [58] At their meeting with Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program, as well as a prime minister to lead the joint government. Both M5S and the League announced their intention to ask their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend.  On 21 May 2018, a private law professor, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister in the 2018 Italian government. [59] [60] [61] Despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government, [62] Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace on 23 May 2018 to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet. [63] [64] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the "defense lawyer of Italian people". [65]  However, on 27 May, Conte renounced his mandate, due to conflicts between Salvini and Mattarella. Salvini had proposed university professor Paolo Savona as Finance Minister, but Mattarella strongly opposed the appointment, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German. [66] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the Eurozone and that, as the guarantor of the Italian Constitution and the country's interest and stability, he could not allow this. Mattarella subsequently gave economist Carlo Cottarelli the presidential mandate to form a new government [67] [68] [69]  Mattarella's decision prompted furious reactions from the Five Star Movement, who called for Mattarella's impeachment, a move also supported by opposition party Brothers of Italy. [70] The League did not support this action. [71]  Calls for impeachment were strongly criticized by Italian and international press: Luciano Fontana (editor of Corriere della Sera) defended Mattarella and said that "Di Maio and Salvini are responsible of this crisis", Mario Calabresi (editor of la Repubblica) dismissed impeachment proposals as "delirious" while La Stampa called Di Maio and Meloni's proposal "extremely irresponsible". [72] HuffPost editor Lucia Annunziata dismissed Di Maio and Salvini as "liars", newsmagazine L'Espresso called them "subversive", while Le Monde praised Mattarella as an "intransigent guardian of the Constitution". The president was also defended by The Guardian, Libération and Der Spiegel; German business newspaper Handelsblatt even titled "Forza Mattarella!" ("Go Mattarella!") [73] [74] [75] [76] Marco Travaglio and Maurizio Belpietro (editors of Il Fatto Quotidiano and La Verità) criticized Mattarella's move as an abuse, but recognized that it was not sufficient to start an impeachment procedure. [77] [78]  On 31 May Giuseppe Conte received again the presidential mandate to form the new cabinet. [79] The new government was sworn in on 1 June.  2019 political crisis[ edit ]  President Mattarella during the August 2019 consultations.  In August 2019, deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini announced a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority. [80] Many political analysts believe the no-confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in Parliament, ensuring that Salvini would become the next prime minister. [81] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte harshly accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who "had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest", [82] the prime minister resigned his post to President Mattarella. [83] On the following day, Mattarella started the consultations with parliamentary groups. [84]  During the round of the so-called consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party. [85] On 28 August, PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti announced at the Quirinal Palace his favorable position on keeping Giuseppe Conte at the head of the new government, [86] and on following day, Mattarella received Conte to give him the task of forming a new cabinet. [87] On 4 September, Conte announced the composition of his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day. [88] On 9 September 2019, the Chamber of Deputies granted the confidence to the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against and 3 abstentions. [89] [90] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of the new government and 133 voted against. [91]  Coronavirus pandemic[ edit ]  Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy  During Mattarella's presidency, Italy was hit by a major outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, Italy became one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. [92] As of September 2020, more than 300,000 coronavirus cases and 35,000 deaths were confirmed, affecting mainly the regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont. [93]  On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country. [94] On 8 March 2020, the Italian government extended the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under lockdown. [95] On the following day, the government extended the quarantine measures previously applied only in the so-called "red zones" to the whole country, putting de facto 60 million people in lockdown. [96] [97] At the time of its application, this measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history. [98] [99] [100] [101] On 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms. [102] The possibility to travel between different regions was restored on 3 June. [103]  He was married to Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, a professor of Roman law and rector of the University of Palermo. His wife died in 2012. He has three children: [104] Bernardo Giorgio (born 1968), [105] Laura (1968) and Francesco (1973).  His brother, Piersanti Mattarella, was murdered in 1980 in Sicily by Cosa Nostra while serving as President of the Regional Government of Sicily. Another brother, Antonio Mattarella, has been appointed Managing Director of the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs from 2005 to 2017. [106] [107]  His daughter, Laura, acted as de facto First Lady, accompanying her father in the official trips outside Italy.  ^ a b c d Elected in a closed list proportional representation system.

Dan	Vladimir Voronkov	Induvidual	https://uhrp.org/news-commentary/un-terrorism-chief-criticized-trip-xinjiang	June 19, 2019, 3:48 PM  China has been condemned internationally for the forced internment of an estimated one to 1.5 million Uyghurs in political “re-education” camps in Xinjiang. Beijing has consistently invoked a counter-terrorism narrative to justify the existence of the camps and the accompanying campaign to eradicate Uyghur identity, citing the need to control the spread of Islamic extremism and separatist movements. CNN’s Ben Westcott reports that a visit to Xinjiang last week by Russian diplomat Vladimir Ivanovich Voronkov, the Under-Secretary for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office, has garnered heavy criticism from human rights advocates and Western governments, who fear Beijing will use the trip to reinforce its war on terror propaganda.  Voronkov finished a three-day trip to the region on June 15, and issued a statement in which he said he met with local officials in Urumqi and “briefed on the implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.”  There was no mention in Voronkov’s press release of the estimated two million Muslim majority Uyghur who, according to the US State Department, have been held in mass detention centers in the far western region.  […] In a statement Monday, Human Rights Watch China director Sophie Richardson accused Voronkov of failing to condemn the abuses in Xinjiang’s “political education” camps.  “Voronkov’s departure statement conveys no concern about Beijing’s abuses of Uyghurs and makes no reference to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michele Bachelet’s request for unrestricted access to the region,” she said.  “It didn’t even challenge China’s narrative that the problems in Xinjiang are ones of terrorism, rather than human rights abuses.” Richardson said the UN had empowered Beijing, “at the cost of Uyghurs’ human rights.” [ Source ]  The controversial visit by Voronkov marks the first high-level visit by a U.N. official to Xinjiang. The trip risks overshadowing travel plans by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who has repeatedly sought access to the region to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions.  China’s foreign ministry announced in a statement that local officials and Voronkov had reached a “broad consensus” during his trip, suggesting the UN was supportive of the country’s counter-terrorism efforts. From Ben Blanchard at Reuters:  In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said that Voronkov had visited Beijing and Xinjiang from June 13-15, meeting senior diplomats including Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng.  The two sides “had a deep exchange of views on the international counter-terrorism situation and counter-terrorism cooperation between China and the United Nations, and reached a broad consensus”, the ministry said, without giving details.  China and the world need to stand together to fight terror, and China supports the work of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office, the statement added. [ Source ]  Speaking to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres in a phone conversation last Friday, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan expressed his concerns over Voronkov’s visit. From Reuters:  US deputy secretary of state John Sullivan spoke with UN secretary-general António Guterres on Friday “to convey deep concerns” about Voronkov’s trip because “Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not”.  “The deputy secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims,” the US State Department said in a statement.  “The UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims,” the statement said.  […] “China will, and is, actively saying that what they’re doing in Xinjiang is good terrorism prevention,” said a UN security council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  “The visit by Voronkov validates their narrative that this is a counterterrorism issue, when we would see it more as a human rights issue,” said the diplomat, adding that if Voronkov did not speak out after visiting Xinjiang then “silence could be seen as implicit acceptance, at worst UN complicity”. [ Source ]  Although several countries including Britain have joined the U.S. in objecting to the trip, others have been reluctant to stand up to Chinese pressure. At Foreign Policy, Vanessa Frangville and Rune Steenberg look at how the Belgian Embassy in Beijing compelled a Uyghur family to travel to China for their visa application despite knowing the danger it posed.  Tursun fled to Belgium, where he was granted asylum in 2018 and now works full time in a major Belgian company. He immediately began the process of applying for a Belgian family reunification visa for his wife and four children. The visa application included a letter describing the family’s situation as critical, stressing the risk such an application put them in and the need for discretion.  Despite repeated requests by the family to simplify the visa proceedings in order to reduce this risk, the embassy insisted on them making two trips to Beijing. By itself, this put the family in danger: Uighurs traveling outside of Xinjiang are inherently seen as suspicious, monitored by police, and often detained at airports or stations.  On May 26, Tursun’s wife, Wureyetiguli Abula, and their children (who are 5, 10, 12, and 17) secretly flew from Urumqi to Beijing for the second time to complete the visa application and hand in the last documents to the Belgian Embassy. They arrived on a late-night flight to avoid the airport police and checked into a hotel. Since Uighurs are routinely refused service from hotels, and their visits are often reported to the police, the hotel was pre-booked by a friend. Still, less than an hour after their arrival, after they were forced to show ID to register there, the Beijing police knocked at their door and interrogated them. Police officers came again the next evening, intimidating them and encouraging them to return to Urumqi.  […] A long discussion ensued, and security staff ushered the family out into the embassy’s yard, where they lingered. At 2 a.m., the embassy called the Chinese police to the embassy facilities in order to remove the family. This is an extraordinary measure, only allowed in the most exceptional of circumstances. Abula and her children were taken to the local police station for a short interrogation by Xinjiang police, who had traveled to Beijing, and the officers tried to convince them to leave the capital. [ Source ]  BBC reporter John Sudworth was invited on a government-sponsored tour of one internment camp in Xinjiang, and provided rare footage of the camps while also interviewing former detainees about their experiences:  Elsewhere, VOA reports that prominent Uyghur writer Nurmuhammad Tohti has died at an internment camp in Xinjiang after being brought there by state authorities from his home last year.

Beijing has consistently invoked a counter-terrorism narrative to justify the existence of the camps and the accompanying campaign to eradicate Uyghur identity, citing the need to control the spread of Islamic extremism and separatist movements. CNN’s Ben Westcott reports that a visit to Xinjiang last week by Russian diplomat Vladimir Ivanovich Voronkov, the Under-Secretary for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office, has garnered heavy criticism from human rights advocates and Western governments, who fear Beijing will use the trip to reinforce its war on terror propaganda.\n\nVoronkov finished a three-day trip to the region on June 15, and issued a statement in which he said he met with local officials in Urumqi and “briefed on the implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.”\n\nThere was no mention in Voronkov’s press release of the estimated two million Muslim majority Uyghur who, according to the US State Department, have been held in mass detention centers in the far western region.\n\n[…] In a statement Monday, Human Rights Watch China director Sophie Richardson accused Voronkov of failing to condemn the abuses in Xinjiang’s “political education” camps.\n\n“Voronkov’s departure statement conveys no concern about Beijing’s abuses of Uyghurs and makes no reference to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michele Bachelet’s request for unrestricted access to the region,” she said.\n\n“It didn’t even challenge China’s narrative that the problems in Xinjiang are ones of terrorism, rather than human rights abuses.” Richardson said the UN had empowered Beijing, “at the cost of Uyghurs’ human rights.” [ Source ]\n\nThe controversial visit by Voronkov marks the first high-level visit by a U.N. official to Xinjiang. The trip risks overshadowing travel plans by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who has repeatedly sought access to the region to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry announced in a statement that local officials and Voronkov had reached a “broad consensus” during his trip, suggesting the UN was supportive of the country’s counter-terrorism efforts. From Ben Blanchard at Reuters:\n\nIn a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said that Voronkov had visited Beijing and Xinjiang from June 13-15, meeting senior diplomats including Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng.\n\nThe two sides “had a deep exchange of views on the international counter-terrorism situation and counter-terrorism cooperation between China and the United Nations, and reached a broad consensus”, the ministry said, without giving details.\n\nChina and the world need to stand together to fight terror, and China supports the work of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office, the statement added. [ Source ]\n\nSpeaking to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres in a phone conversation last Friday, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan expressed his concerns over Voronkov’s visit. From Reuters:\n\nUS deputy secretary of state John Sullivan spoke with UN secretary-general António Guterres on Friday “to convey deep concerns” about Voronkov’s trip because “Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not”.\n\n“The deputy secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims,” the US State Department said in a statement.\n\n“The UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims,” the statement said.\n\n[…] “China will, and is, actively saying that what they’re doing in Xinjiang is good terrorism prevention,” said a UN security council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n“The visit by Voronkov validates their narrative that this is a counterterrorism issue, when we would see it more as a human rights issue,” said the diplomat, adding that if Voronkov did not speak out after visiting Xinjiang then “silence could be seen as implicit acceptance, at worst UN complicity”. [ Source ]\n\nAlthough several countries including Britain have joined the U.S. in objecting to the trip, others have been reluctant to stand up to Chinese pressure. At Foreign Policy, Vanessa Frangville and Rune Steenberg look at how the Belgian Embassy in Beijing compelled a Uyghur family to travel to China for their visa application despite knowing the danger it posed.\n\nTursun fled to Belgium, where he was granted asylum in 2018 and now works full time in a major Belgian company. He immediately began the process of applying for a Belgian family reunification visa for his wife and four children. The visa application included a letter describing the family’s situation as critical, stressing the risk such an application put them in and the need for discretion.\n\nDespite repeated requests by the family to simplify the visa proceedings in order to reduce this risk, the embassy insisted on them making two trips to Beijing. By itself, this put the family in danger: Uighurs traveling outside of Xinjiang are inherently seen as suspicious, monitored by police, and often detained at airports or stations.\n\nOn May 26, Tursun’s wife, Wureyetiguli Abula, and their children (who are 5, 10, 12, and 17) secretly flew from Urumqi to Beijing for the second time to complete the visa application and hand in the last documents to the Belgian Embassy. They arrived on a late-night flight to avoid the airport police and checked into a hotel. Since Uighurs are routinely refused service from hotels, and their visits are often reported to the police, the hotel was pre-booked by a friend. Still, less than an hour after their arrival, after they were forced to show ID to register there, the Beijing police knocked at their door and interrogated them. Police officers came again the next evening, intimidating them and encouraging them to return to Urumqi.\n\n[…] A long discussion ensued, and security staff ushered the family out into the embassy’s yard, where they lingered. At 2 a.m., the embassy called the Chinese police to the embassy facilities in order to remove the family. This is an extraordinary measure, only allowed in the most exceptional of circumstances. Abula and her children were taken to the local police station for a short interrogation by Xinjiang police, who had traveled to Beijing, and the officers tried to convince them to leave the capital. [ Source ]\n\nBBC reporter John Sudworth was invited on a government-sponsored tour of one internment camp in Xinjiang, and provided rare footage of the camps while also interviewing former detainees about their experiences:\n\nElsewhere, VOA reports that prominent Uyghur writer Nurmuhammad Tohti has died at an internment camp in Xinjiang after being brought there by state authorities from his home last year.

Shakshi	Harald V of Norway	Individual	https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harald-V	Harald V king of Norway from 1991, succeeding his father, Olav V.  Harald was the youngest of three children born to Olav and Crown Princess Märtha. However, as the only son he became crown prince when his father assumed the throne in 1957. Harald attended the Norwegian Military Academy and Balliol College, Oxford, and attained the rank of captain in three branches of his country’s armed forces. Like his father he was a fine athlete and excelled at yachting.  Harald’s courtship of a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, caused some controversy, and he reportedly threatened to never wed if the couple were prevented from marrying. Olav eventually gave his consent, and, after some nine years of dating, the pair were married on August 29, 1968. Harald and Sonja had two children, Märtha Louise (born 1971) and Haakon Magnus (born 1973).  Harald became king of Norway upon the death of his father on January 17, 1991. Although the succession law had been changed in 1990—with the eldest child, whether male or female, assuming the throne—it applied only to those born subsequently, and thus Haakon became crown prince. Like the duties of other Scandinavian monarchs, Harald’s were largely ceremonial.

Carel	Angela Merkel	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38375555	image copyrightAP  German police are investigating a "probable terrorist attack" after a man ploughed a lorry into a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.  The driver, a Pakistani asylum seeker who entered Germany last year, is being questioned.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be "particularly sickening" if he were proven to be a refugee.  He was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terror links.  German media say police have searched a refugee shelter at a defunct Berlin airport where the suspect was believed to be staying.  Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man was probably from Pakistan, and that his application for asylum had not yet been processed.  The suspect denies involvement, Mr de Maiziere said.  Live: Latest updates  Berlin attack: What we know  "We have to assume this was a terrorist attack", Mrs Merkel said in a short statement on Tuesday.  Those behind the attack would be punished "as harshly as the law allows", she added.  What happened?  The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in Berlin's west.  The attack happened in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which was damaged in a World War Two bombing raid and preserved as a symbol of peace.  The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), one of its busiest times. It crashed through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.  The DPA news agency said police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area.  What do we know about the suspect?  German media have identified the suspect, citing security sources, as a 23-year-old Pakistani named Naved B who entered the country in either late 2015 or early 2016.  Reports said special forces had stormed a hangar at Berlin's Tempelhof airport where they believed the suspect had been living in a shelter before the attack.  Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said he was seized after leaving the lorry and fleeing on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.  A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.  Where did the lorry come from?  Police said a Polish man, believed to be the original driver, had been found dead on the passenger seat.  Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.  image copyrightReuters  "We don't know what happened to him," he told the AFP news agency. "He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him."  The truck was registered in Poland, but it is unclear whether it was travelling from Poland or returning from Italy, as some reports suggest.  How has Germany reacted?  Chancellor Merkel said she was "shocked and very saddened" by the attack but added "we don't want to live with fear of evil".  Germany's interior ministry said Christmas markets in Berlin would remain closed on Tuesday but other markets outside of the capital will operate as normal.  A senior member of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Marcus Pretzell, blamed Mrs Merkel for the attack, linking it to her open-door migration policy which saw the arrival of more than one million people last year.  What do eyewitnesses say happened?  A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press that the 25-tonne lorry had missed him by only about three metres as it smashed through stands and knocked down a large Christmas tree.  "It was definitely deliberate," said the tourist.  He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.  image copyrightReuters  Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed "blood and bodies everywhere".  "I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed.  "I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there."  'I heard the noise and the screams'  Is this the first such attack?  A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Ten people were killed and dozens more injured in separate gun, bomb, axe and machete attacks in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg in July.  A year of terror in Germany  But Monday's incident was reminiscent of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).  The mayor of Nice, Philippe Pradal, said the Berlin incident shared the same "blind violence" as the attack on his city.  Both IS and al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds.  image copyrightReuters  The US labelled the tragedy an apparent "terrorist attack" and pledged its support.  President-elect Donald Trump blamed "Islamist terrorists" for a "slaughter" of Christians in the German capital.  "Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!" he tweeted.

their lives when the lorry rammed into the festive crowds</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>German police are investigating a "probable terrorist attack" after a man ploughed a lorry into a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The driver, a Pakistani asylum seeker who entered Germany last year, is being questioned.</p>\n\n<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be "particularly sickening" if he were proven to be a refugee.</p>\n\n<p>He was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terror links.</p>\n\n<p>German media say police have searched a refugee shelter at a defunct Berlin airport where the suspect was believed to be staying.</p>\n\n<p>Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man was probably from Pakistan, and that his application for asylum had not yet been processed.</p>\n\n<p>The suspect denies involvement, Mr de Maiziere said.</p>\n\n<p><a

have to assume this was a terrorist attack", Mrs Merkel said in a short statement on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Those behind the attack would be punished "as harshly as the law allows", she added.</p>\n\n<h2>What happened?</h2>\n\n<p>The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in Berlin\'s west.</p>\n\n<p>The attack happened in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which was damaged in a World War Two bombing raid and preserved as a symbol of peace.</p>\n\n<p>The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), one of its busiest times. It crashed through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.</p>\n\n<p>The DPA news agency said police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area.</p>\n\n<h2>What do we know about the suspect?</h2>\n\n<p>German media have identified the suspect, citing security sources, as a 23-year-old Pakistani named Naved B who entered the country in either late 2015 or early 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Reports said special forces had stormed a hangar at Berlin\'s Tempelhof airport where they believed the suspect had been living in a shelter before the attack.</p>\n\n<p>Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said he was seized after leaving the lorry and fleeing on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.</p>\n\n<p>A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.</p>\n\n<h2>Where did the lorry come from?</h2>\n\n<p>Police said a Polish man, believed to be the original driver, had been found dead on the passenger seat.</p>\n\n<p>Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.</p>\n\n<figure>image copyrightReuters<figcaption>image captionAmbulances and heavily armed police rushed to the scene of the crash</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>"We don\'t know what happened to him," he told the AFP news agency.

Carel	Wolfsberg Group	Organization	https://rusi.org/commentary/heading-brexit-tackling-financial-crime-needs-more-not-less-partnership	As the date for the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU approaches, the focus of debate has settled on the impact that so-called ‘Brexit’ would have on security, the economy and immigration.  For the financial crime-combating community, the question of Brexit brings together two of these issues: security and the economy – or, more precisely, the issue of fighting crime and the position of the UK as the leading international global financial centre. The latter point has received much media coverage, with most ‘current practitioners’ in the financial sector expressing a preference to remain part of the EU given the benefits that accrue to locating a financial services business within the EU and ‘passporting’ activity seamlessly into the other member states without incurring further regulatory impediments. The former issue – security/crime-fighting – has also been widely discussed by politicians and former security and intelligence leaders in broad terms; however, the impact that Brexit would have on tackling financial crime has so far been neglected.  The UK has, over the past two years, placed considerable national security emphasis on the importance of tackling financial and economic crime. The recently published Action Plan for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance reiterates the government’s commitment to protecting the security and prosperity of citizens and the integrity of Britain’s world-leading financial system by vigorously pursuing those who abuse it for illicit means. It therefore seems right to question the extent to which this commitment would be affected by the UK’s exit from the EU.  It would seem that, prima facie, leaving the EU would be entirely negative for the UK’s efforts to tackle financial crime (including terrorist financing) for the simple reason that, given the globalised nature of finance, tackling the associated crime needs more, not less partnership. The former heads of the Security Service and of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI5 and MI6) have drawn attention to the importance of the cross-border data sharing within the EU on which the UK relies to help ‘reveal the associations and activities of terrorists and cyber-attackers’. This co-operation is equally imperative for combating the financing of such malevolent actors and identifying those that perpetrate extortion, money laundering and corruption.  Finance is a highly globalised industry. Payments, particularly those associated with corruption, trade-based money laundering and sanctions circumvention, are necessarily transnational and can only be disrupted if information can be exchanged between nations and financial institutions efficiently. As evidenced by the hand-wringing of international leaders after each of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe and further afield, accomplishing arrangements for the sharing of information is a challenging task. Lack of trust and different cultural approaches to – and legal positions on – data privacy frustrate, at the best of times, the sharing of information to disrupt all forms of crime and terrorism, including financial crime and the financing of terrorism.  Of course, Brexiters will retort that many of the structures created to combat financial crime and terrorist financing are themselves global and are thus unrelated to EU membership. First among these is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance. The UK is, in its own right, a leading member of this group of 35-member jurisdictions and two regional organisations, and it would continue to benefit from the FATF’s work regardless of its status within the EU.  Likewise, the UK Financial Intelligence Unit’s membership of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units would be unaffected by Brexit, as would the UK’s membership of the G20 and G7, other bodies that busy themselves with matters related to financial crime and terrorist financing. Similarly, the status of the UK banks that are members of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of thirteen global banks which aims to develop frameworks and guidance for the management of financial crime risks, would also be unaffected by Brexit, since their membership is a function of their size and global importance. Yet most of these structures are focused on policy, not the operational reality of disrupting financial crime, which requires close, cross-border co-operation and information sharing.  As with everything currently discussed within the Brexit debate, the interconnectedness of the UK with other EU member states means that it is simply impossible to walk away from the EU and not continue to feel the impact of its rules and regulations. The recent Schrems case provides a timely reminder that non-EU countries’ data privacy laws must be ‘ essentially equivalent ’ to EU law if data is to be shared with a country outside the EU. In that case, an Austrian citizen, Maximillian Schrems, argued that – contrary to the view laid out in a 2000 European Commission directive – the US did not comply with the EU’s data protection standards. The European Court of Justice found that, given the 2013 Snowden revelations, the Commission’s directive was now invalid. Given the significant financial links between the UK and the rest of the EU – both for business and for tackling financial crime – it is hard to imagine that the UK would risk breaking critical information-sharing links by turning its back on Brussels-derived data protection regulation, even though this regulation at times frustrates the UK government’s efforts to widen its own data sharing and surveillance powers. So if the UK wants to maintain its information-sharing links it must abide by EU data protection regulation, yet leaving the EU would mean having no say in the development of this regulation.  The value of EU membership for fighting crime, particularly cross-border crime, has been well argued: it provides civil judicial co-operation measures; it provides access to EU police and criminal justice tools that ensure effective collective action and also grants access to European criminal records information. In addition to these general crime-related procedures and agreements, EU membership also gives the UK access to specific financial crime-fighting systems such as FIU.net and other initiatives run by Europol.  While some might welcome escaping the clutches of allegedly ‘ bizarre ’ EU legislation such as the 4th Money Laundering Directive, which advocates greater scrutiny of domestic politicians, the globalised nature of finance and the necessarily cross-border nature of efforts to respond to associated criminality mean that – at a time when the sharing of information to combat financial crime and terrorist financing is an international imperative – any action that reduces the UK’s ability to participate in information-sharing mechanisms and forums would seem counter-intuitive.  For those tasked with tackling financial crime and fulfilling the UK government’s pledge to make the country ‘a more hostile place for those seeking to move, hide or use the proceeds of crime and corruption or to evade sanctions’, Brexit would be a significantly retrograde step.

Carel	Alexandra Wrage	Individual	https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/01/global-bribery-corruption-scandal-worldwide-index-infographic/	Corruption, graft, and palm-greasing are a real and growing drag on the global economy — and they open the door to a host of evils like drug smuggling and human trafficking. Bribes to the tune of about $1.5 trillion change hands every year, according to the International Monetary Fund, or about 5 percent of global GDP.  And the true cost of corruption doesn’t just boil down to money, either. “You can’t have narco-trafficking without bribery, human trafficking without bribery, or even terrorism without bribery,” said Alexandra Wrage, president and founder of the anti-bribery organization TRACE International.  TRACE says that bribery is getting worse, with global graft on the rise, according to a new study. Some 60 percent of countries have an increased bribery risk compared with the 2014 study, while only 32 percent have a decreased bribery risk, the group says. While anti-bribery laws and enforcement are on the upswing in many countries, government transparency and capacity for civil society oversight of anti-bribery are not.  The study shows the cleanest — and most graft-prone — countries around the world, ranking countries on a scale of 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher bribery risks.  See how each country stacks up here:  Sweden comes out on top with a score of 10, followed by New Zealand at 15 and Estonia at 17. The most bribery-prone country in the world is Nigeria, with a score of 99. Russia is actually getting cleaner, TRACE says, improving from a score of 65 two years ago to 58 today. China, despite a huge anti-corruption drive in Beijing, sits immobile with a score of 66.  Even the United States even saw a slight increase in bribery risk, going from a score of 27 in 2014 to a score of 34 in 2016, though it’s still a lot closer to Sweden than Swaziland. The United States improved anti-bribery laws, according to the study, but saw its score rise because of increased business-to-government interactions and a slight backslide in civil society oversight of bribery.  “Generally, more places have gotten worse than have gotten better,” Virna Di Palma, senior director of global strategy with TRACE, told Foreign Policy. In particular, the Americas, Africa, and East Asia are backsliding on fighting corruption, Di Palma said.  Corruption hemorrhages public trust in governments. A Transparency International study released in November found, after surveying 60,000 Europeans and Central Asians, 53 percent thought their governments handled corruption poorly, while only 23 percent thought they were doing well. One in three surveyed thought their government’s officials and lawmakers were mostly corrupt. Even in the supposedly cleaner and more advanced West, public ire at corruption — whether real or perceived — helps fuel populist political movements.  All is not necessarily lost, though, says Wrage. Corporate behavior is getting more legal scrutiny around the world. And if bribery scores are high now, it may be because bribery was simply more difficult to track in the past. “It’s not that there’s more bribery, it’s that it’s more visible,” Wrage said.  Companies are also learning that dirty business can be bad business, says Di Palma. Additionally, small and medium-sized companies — not just multinationals — are beginning to take anti-graft measures more seriously.  “We see the world trending in the right direction,” Di Palma said. “Initially companies were only interested because of increased anti-bribery enforcement, but in the last few years we’ve seen a change,” she said, adding that “companies are recognizing that bribery is a bad business strategy.”	[{'query': {'id': '1605370002375-2f04be3e90f72f23', 'domain': 'foreignpolicy.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/01/global-bribery-corruption-scandal-worldwide-index-infographic/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/01/global-bribery-corruption-scandal-worldwide-index-infographic/', 'author': 'Robbie Gramer', 'images': ['https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corruption-crop.jpg?w=800&h=383&quality=90'], 'headline': 'Bribery Is on the Rise Worldwide, and It Costs A Lot More Than Just Money', 'mainImage': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corruption-crop.jpg?w=960', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Corruption, graft, and palm-greasing are a real and growing drag on the global economy — and they open the door to a host of evils like drug smuggling and human trafficking.

Carel	Gretchen Morgenson	Individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/insurance-companies-take-over-pension-plans-are-your-payments-risk-n1229226	How safe is your pension? As COVID-19 shutdowns hobble the U.S. economy, the question has taken on more urgency.  While risks associated with underfunded pensions for state and local government employees have been known for years, a new concern has arisen, pension rights advocates say. It centers on the growing trend of insurance companies taking over pensions for employees of private companies.  “This is what we’ve worried about — when companies sell off their pension plans,” said Karen Friedman, policy director at the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit focusing on workers’ retirement security. “Is it safe to transfer money out of pension plans insured by the [government-backed] Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insurance companies where the protections for consumers are scant?”  Pension obligations are costly and companies have been eager to jettison them in recent years. Insurers have been happy to take on their assets — such deals have totaled $110 billion since early 2015.  But pensions taken over by private insurers are not protected from default by the government-backed PBGC, which protects the pensions of most private company employees. In addition, insurers are regulated by the states, not the federal government, and some are now affiliated with private equity firms, whose focus is often on short-term profits which can conflict with insurers' long-term obligations.  Concerns for health insurance loom as unemployment numbers rise  June 3, 202001:31  Insurance company Athene Holding, a relative newcomer to the arena, has vaulted to the number-two position in pension buyouts. Created in 2009, Athene is affiliated with Apollo Global Management, the publicly traded private equity giant co-founded by billionaire Leon Black. Athene, whose stock trades publicly, is Apollo’s biggest investment. Apollo has $330 billion in assets under management, with over $100 billion related to Athene, its filings show. The insurer pays significant fees to Apollo each year — Athene's investment management fees to Apollo accounted for 27 percent of Apollo's total such fees in 2019.  Athene has acquired $12 billion in corporate pension obligations recently, including those of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dana Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Today, roughly 178,000 people rely on Athene for pension benefits, the company says. The entity taking most of the obligations is Athene Annuity & Life Co.  Athene Holding has performed well, but in the first quarter of 2020, it reported a $1.1 billion loss, in part reflecting financial market turmoil. Some $300 million of that loss came from Athene’s 7 percent stake in Apollo.  Financial markets have recovered since March 31, shoring up Athene’s Apollo holding.  Still, the loss raises questions about risks in Athene’s investments.  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Board published a paper in February warning of risks among a handful of insurers that are structured like Athene. The study, which cited Athene as an example, concluded, “Life insurers have become more vulnerable to an aggregate shock to the corporate sector.”  Joseph M. Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University and a longtime authority on the industry, told NBC News that he thinks private equity firms like Apollo are not well-suited to partner with insurance companies.  “I think private equity firms are in it for the quick buck and that is what troubles me,” Belth said. “Policyholders are pawns in the hands of people like Black.”  Asked to respond, Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Apollo and Black said in a statement that Athene’s and Apollo’s interests are closely aligned. “Athene was founded with long-term capital from blue-chip insurance investors, not from a private equity fund,” she said. "Athene does not invest in Apollo’s flagship PE funds, nor does it lend to Apollo’s PE portfolio companies."  Athene's spokeswoman, Karen Lynn, said in a statement: "Athene strongly disagrees with various characterizations of our business asserted in this article. We are highly rated, disciplined and financially strong as one of the best-capitalized businesses in the financial sector."  8.6 million Americans  About 8.6 million Americans over 65 are receiving pension payments from a private company plan, and millions more who are still working are paying into private plans. Most of those plans are insured through the government-backed Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. PBGC says it protects around 40 million workers in 23,400 pension plans.  When a company defaults on its pension obligations, PBGC pays the pension, in most cases. Some 84 percent of participants in private company plans taken over by the PBGC received all their vested benefits, a 2019 study showed. The remaining 16 percent saw their benefits fall by an average 24 percent. As of 2019, PBGC has assumed the pension obligations of almost 5,000 plans and more than 900,000 retirees.  When private insurance companies take over pension plans, they typically offer participants a group annuity that pays the same amount as the private plan. An annuity is an insurance contract that can provide lifetime monthly income. The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees enforcement of pension rules, has not objected to these takeovers.  However, those pensions are no longer backed by the PBGC. They are backed by the insurers, which must be disclosed when the transfer takes place.  Insurers are not regulated by the federal government. That task falls to each state in which the companies do business.  Athene Holding is based in Bermuda, while its unit Athene Annuity & Life Co. is in Iowa. In April, the New York insurance overseer accused Athene Holding of failing to register its pension takeover business there. Athene Holding paid $45 million to settle the matter, neither admitting nor denying the allegations.  State insurance regulators require insurers to file annual reports detailing their investment portfolios and the assets they have to cover policyholders’ claims. The key figure — surplus — is the difference between an insurer’s assets and liabilities. The bigger the cushion, the better.  Athene Annuity & Life, the insurer backing most of the pension obligations, has $54 billion in assets, filings show. And a $1.2 billion surplus — which is roughly $1 billion above the level at which the regulator overseeing the company would have to move in to protect policyholders.  If an insurance company gets into trouble, its assets are sold to pay policyholders' claims. If insufficient, policyholders must rely on state guaranty funds financed voluntarily by other insurers. Unlike the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has a pre-funded insurance pool protecting depositors against bank failures, state guaranty funds raise money only after a failure occurs.  States impose limits on how much policyholders can receive in a failure. In Alabama, Colorado and Iowa for example, the most annuity holders can receive is $250,000.  When Athene Annuity & Life takes over a pension, it receives assets backing those obligations from the company that formerly ran it. Athene sends 80 percent of those assets and liabilities to an affiliated reinsurer in Bermuda, the company’s filings say, and keeps the remaining 20 percent in U.S. entities.  Thomas Gober, a certified fraud examiner in Virginia who analyzes insurance companies and has worked as a consultant to and witness for the U.S. Department of Justice, questioned Athene’s heavy reliance on related companies to reinsure or backstop its policyholder obligations.  “A strong group of independent, well-capitalized reinsurers can strengthen an insurer’s financial backbone,” said Gober.  In a typical reinsurance or coinsurance arrangement, an insurer will pay an unrelated company to provide a backstop to cover the initial insurer’s obligations if necessary. Under such an arrangement, the initial and secondary insurers share profits and losses based on a preset ratio.  Athene Annuity & Life’s most recent regulatory filings show 95 percent of its reinsurance and coinsurance deals were with affiliates — $54 billion of $57 billion. This defeats the purpose of a backstop, Gober said. New York Life Insurance Co., which carries the highest ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, has zero reinsurance or coinsurance deals with affiliates.  One affiliated reinsurer is Athene Re USA IV, which provided a $1.4 billion backstop to Athene Annuity & Life as of 2019. The reinsurer’s risk-based capital falls well below mandatory levels, under National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ rules, filings show. That’s because one of the assets it uses to compute its capital — letters of credit for $137 million — is not admitted per the NAIC. Its rules don’t allow letters of credit as assets because they represent the risk of a bank, not the insurance company, said David Provost, deputy commissioner of the captive insurance division of the Vermont department of regulation.  Vermont regulators, where Athene Re is domiciled, did allow the letters of credit to be included as an asset. “We are making a regulatory judgment that this is acceptable,” said Provost. He did not disclose the identity of the banks backing them.  Karen Lynn, a spokeswoman for Athene, said its Bermuda-based reinsurers are strong and have capital “consistent with a AA-rated company.” (An AA rating is considered high quality; AAA is the highest.)  But outsiders can't analyze the reinsurers' books because Bermuda doesn't require extensive public disclosures. Athene’s annual Bermuda filings consist of 5 pages and few details, versus the Iowa subsidiary’s over 1,000-page annual state filing. And policyholders can typically collect only from the insurer that wrote their policies, which is why the $1.2 billion in surplus held by Athene Annuity & Life Co. should be the focus, according to Gober.  Policyholders who are unfortunate enough to get caught up in an insurance company failure face another challenge: litigation can drag on for decades. In January 2020, for example, a federal appeals court ruled on a case involving money owed on an annuity written by Executive Life. That company failed in 1991.  After Executive Life collapsed, many of the insurer’s assets were picked up at significant discounts by Black’s firm, Apollo.  ‘Special and symbiotic’  The relationship between Apollo and Athene, the subsidiary that backs pensions, is “special and symbiotic,” Black told investors in March.  For Apollo, the arrangement is lucrative. Over the past three years, Athene has paid Apollo $1 billion in management fees.  For Thomas Gober, however, the relationship between the companies is problematic. There is nothing illegal about Athene's practices, but Gober sees problems with the company's relatively thin surplus, the quality of Athene’s investments, and the habit of Athene of investing in Apollo-related entities. Apollo owns 35 percent of Athene, and Athene owns seven percent of Apollo.  The Federal Reserve researchers also expressed concerns, concluding that private-equity backed insurers may test the ability “of the insurance industry, and the financial system more broadly” to withstand “direct and indirect shocks to the corporate sector."  The Athene spokeswoman said the Fed report did not provide "comprehensive insight into how we manage our business. We have maintained, and will continue to maintain, very strong liquidity within our diversified investment portfolio, and we take great care to invest behind predictable, surrender charge protected, long-dated policyholder obligations."  In a corporate pension buyout, a company, say Bristol-Myers, hands its pension assets and obligations over to Athene. To meet these obligations, insurers typically invest policyholders’ money in corporate bonds, government obligations, and mortgages.  When an insurance company sells a policy or annuity, it agrees to pay the holder a set amount under certain circumstances. To meet these obligations, insurers typically invest policyholders’ money in corporate bonds, government obligations, and mortgages.  With Apollo guiding Athene’s portfolio, the insurer has invested heavily in Apollo-related entities, regulatory filings show. Athene Annuity & Life holds $4.1 billion in stocks, bonds and mortgage loans of its "parent, subsidiaries and affiliates," up from $172 million in 2015.  Compared with the insurer’s surplus of $1.2 billion, this is a troubling concentration of assets, said Gober.  “That’s too many eggs in one basket and an affiliated basket,” he said. “If the insurer gets into trouble, the question would be whether the affiliates’ bonds would be collectible because the affiliates are so dependent upon the insurer for revenues.”  By comparison, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corp. has total assets of $54 billion and surplus of $6.4 billion — roughly the same assets as Athene but five times the surplus. Its investments in parent, subsidiaries and affiliates total just $231 million.  NBC News asked Lynn, the Athene spokeswoman, how its policyholders can be sure these investments are good for them and not just good for Apollo affiliates. Because Apollo owns 35 percent of Athene, she said it is "completely aligned with all Athene stakeholders to find the highest quality risk-return assets for Athene’s balance sheet as possible." She also said Athene's investment in Apollo shares would not be used to pay insurance policyholders’ claims, including pension benefits.  Bill Wheeler, Athene's president, said in a statement: "The premise of your story contains the assertion that an affiliation with Apollo means more risk. This is clearly untrue." Moreover, all of its pension takeovers "have been vetted and selected by plan fiduciaries and committees whose sole responsibility is to consider the interest of participants and beneficiaries."  Asked how Athene shareholders and policyholders can assess whether amounts paid in investment management fees to Apollo are fair, Lynn said Athene’s relationship with Apollo has fueled the insurer’s high performance in recent years.  To manage the conflicts of interest arising from Athene’s ties to Apollo, Lynn said the company’s board has a committee that approves the deals. The transactions are also vetted by disinterested directors at Athene, with both groups advised by independent legal and financial advisers.  The conflicts committee “is comprised solely of directors who are independent of Apollo,” she said.  But the Athene proxy filings show all three conflicts committee members are or were directors of Apollo affiliates, including Apollo Residential Mortgage Inc., Apollo Tactical Income Fund and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.  Asked about these affiliations, Lynn said Athene’s governance practices adhere to requirements set out by the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares trade. Athene declined to make the directors available.  While corporate bonds dominate Athene’s investments, it is also a big buyer of commercial mortgages and securities that bundle debt together, known as collateralized loan obligations. The company also holds securities backed by aircraft leases, retailers, oil companies, car rental companies and hotels, all hurt by COVID-19 closures.  Gober studied thousands of pages in regulatory filings of Athene’s major subsidiaries comparing risks in their investments with the cushion the companies have to pay policyholder claims — the surplus.  “The biggest problem with the investment portfolio is it is high risk and illiquid,” Gober told NBC News. “Given how thin their surplus margins are, it’s relevant to compare how much more they have in risky stuff.”  Detroit retirees at risk of losing their pensions  July 22, 201302:11  Lynn disputed the view that the company’s policyholders face risks. “There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that any of our subsidiaries are inadequately capitalized,” she said, “when considering the strength and accessibility of capital across our consolidated business. Athene has more than $12 billion of consolidated statutory capital supporting $112 billion of policyholder reserves, reflecting a ratio which is meaningfully higher than other A+ and AA- rated insurers, as well as other fixed annuity providers."  The quality of Athene’s investments raises questions as well, said Gober. Its most recent filings show more than one-quarter of the securities it intends to sell before they mature were either nonrated or rated below investment grade by agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s.  Asked whether policyholders should be concerned about these holdings, Athene says it prefers to use the ratings method put forward by NAIC. Under this system, only 5.7 percent of the securities are rated below investment grade, its filings say.  Athene’s filings also warn that “many of our invested assets are relatively illiquid,” meaning potentially difficult to sell. The company relies on Apollo for risk management support, its filings say.		nam	A concern for pension plan	Wanting		As insurance companies take over pension plans, are your payments at risk?

Carel	Jho Low	Individual	https://www.sarawakreport.org/2014/05/1mdb-backed-jho-low-with-uk1billion-exclusive-expose/	For well over a year Malaysia’s mystery tycoon, Taek Jho Low has been adamantly denying his links with the shadowy sovereign wealth fund 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).  As recently as this March the US public relations firm Edleman issued a statement on Jho Low’s behalf, again denying that his flamboyant investment activities are supported with Malaysian public money borrowed by the fund.  The statement, which was made to the online business news portal Mkini Biz vouched:  “Neither Low nor any company in which Low is a shareholder has ever received any compensation directly from TIA [Terengganu Investment Authority], 1MDB or the Government of Malaysia, or from any activity related to TIA”  But, now research by Sarawak Report has identified UK High Court evidence, which shows that Mr Taik Jho Low’s claims are at best misleading and certainly open to serious question.  We can demonstrate that in January 2011 1MDB submitted a letter on behalf of Low and his private equity company The Wynton Group pledging to back a share purchase of the prestige Coroin hotel group (which includes the leading London hotels Claridges, The Connaught and The Berkeley) against rival bids from the UK’s Barclay brothers.  That pledge backed Wynton to the tune of a final offer of £1.028 billion (RM5.7billion)!  As it turned out, the shareholders turned down the Malaysian bid, in favour of what they viewed as a more reliable lower offer for the shares.  Evidence backed by a judge  The details of the Coroin bid and the involvement by 1MDB in Jho Low’s privately owned company Wynton Group’s attempted buy out are clearly detailed in a 158 page judgement produced on 10th August 2012 by Justice David Richards of the Chancery Division of Britain’s Royal Courts of Justice.  In the interests of transparency it is available for all to read online.  The judgement details how in 2011 rival bidders were attempting to buy up a controlling number of shares in the Coroin Group from the distressed businessman Derek Quinlan (approximately 39% of the company).  The property magnates known as the Barclay brothers were to emerge as the victors in the takeover, but other shareholders questioned their methods, resulting in the legal case and ensuing judgement by Justice Richards.  In the course of that judgement the judge recorded a number of other bids that had been made during the takeover rivalry and one of those came from Malaysia’s Jho Low representing The Wynton Group along with his brother.  The judge made it clear on a number of occasions that Low was representing himself and his company as an entity backed by a Malaysian Government ‘sovereign wealth fund’. In this court document the British judge begins by relating:  “The Malaysian based investor was Jho Low, a businessman with some backing from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. Through an entity called The Wynton Group, offers were made to the company and its shareholders in January and February 2011″[ Approved Judgement – Patrick McKillen v. Misland (Cyprus) Investments Ltd & 10 others – Royal Courts of Justice Para 50 ]  However, it is clear that the British businessmen selling the shares were not convinced either by Mr Low or the trustworthiness of the Malaysian Government support, according to the judge. As he put it “these [offers] were not at the time taken seriously by most of the shareholders” [paragraph 50].  1MDB provided a written support offering to back Jho Low’s bid  But Jho Low did not give up. He later came back with further strengthened bids and he produced a number of written third party assurances as well, including a letter of 15th January 2011 from 1MDB confirming its support of the offer, as recorded by the judge.  It is these which provide the damning evidence that despite all the denials by the Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is the Chairman of the fund and by Jho Low himself, the private equity dealings of this youthful tycoon have been linked to and closely supported by 1MDB.  The twenty six year old big-spending ‘tycoon’ also had the backing of a Malaysian bank explained the judge and Jho Low himself claimed in a further letter that financing for the offer had been in principle fully underwritten by the Malaysian government:  “As mentioned earlier, it appears that Wynton was controlled by a Malaysian businessman, Jho Low, and his brother. In mid-December 2010, advisers to Wynton made an indicative offer for the shares of the company. Mr McKillen [a shareholder] met Jho Low and his advisers at Claridge’s on 29 December 2010. A revised letter of intent was sent to the shareholders on 3 January 2011, proposing an acquisition of all the shares on the basis of an enterprise value of £1 billion, subject to due diligence and agreement of documentation including warranties and indemnities. An accompanying letter from a Malaysian Bank indicated that it was intended to seek to raise up to £950 million of debt and/or mezzanine finance and £50-£100 million of equity……The provision on 15 January 2011 of a letter from 1 Malaysian Berhad, an investment vehicle wholly owned by the Malaysian government, confirming its support for the offer, did not allay the concerns of the majority of the shareholders. A further letter from Wynton dated 24 January 2011 stated that the financing for the offer had “in principle” been fully underwritten by Malaysian government-backed investment funds.” [Judge Richards – Paragraph 135-138]  As the above makes clear, however, despite the formal letter of support by 1 Malaysian (sic) Berhad, the UK shareholders did not feel confident it was a reliable offer.  The judge explains:  Mr Murphy on Mr Quinlan’s behalf described it as “pure fantasy … In an email dated 11 January 2011, after Mr McKillen had had his meeting in Doha on 9 January 2011, he wrote “my sense is that it is an offer that can’t really be delivered either in time or structure. The delivery of the Malaysian government bond is not guaranteed and the deal may end up in an open ended bridging situation because it does not have the proper financing. I also sense that some Malaysian government may have a political motive and that will naturally delay execution. I am conscious that on paper the Malaysian deal is better to me personally, however, we should be looking at credibility and execution”. Mr McLaughlin was of the same view. Even Mr Buchanan was not confident that Wynton would deliver”  The comments show a devastating lack of confidence by these top businessmen in the credibility of Jho Low and also the Malaysian Government.  However, it confirms that the offer referred to by Justice Richards had been placed on the table with the written backing of 1MDB for a bid of just over £1billion pounds.  Denials  Contrast this enormous commitment with the series of denials, as all concerned have sought to distance 1MDB from the controversial night-clubbing pal of Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz.  “The role of Jho Low as far as 1MDB is concerned is zero,” said 1MDB CEO Datuk Shahrol Halmi, denying that Low has received compensation for his previous role in the firm. [ Malaysia online ]  Despite this, in company CV’s Low does acknowledge links to unspecified sovereign wealth funds.  The line appears to be that his investors are all from the Middle East and are the parents of kids he made friends with at school in the UK and US.  It’s a pity that Jho Low’s most famous and closest acquaintance appears to be the fellow Malaysian Riza Aziz, whose Dad is the PM and head of 1MDB from which billions are currently inadequately accounted for.  Time to stop hiding the truth  With so much information now contradicting the party-loving Jho Low’s various versions of his life story, leading from college grad to major tycoon in no time flat, it is time for the truth.  The Chairman of 1MDB, Prime Minister Najib Razak, should explain transparently exactly which projects the fund has supported or offered to support, rather than relying on the pathetically over-due annual report that came out last week, which admits merely that the money is being invested by an anonymous fund manager in the Cayman Islands on anonymous projects with no guarantees whatsoever that the funds are secure!  These are billions of ringgit of public money borrowed at high interest rates supposedly to invest in Malaysian development.  Yet the money has gone no where near Malaysia and no no one is telling where it is or what it is being used for.  It is even being invested at a lower rate of interest than Najib borrowed it for in the first place!  We have questions  The only exception to this news blackout about what has happened to all this borrowed public money has come from the evidence we have now obtained from this British law case, showing that back in 2011 1MDB funds were offered to secure the purchase of some London Hotels by a private company owned by 26 year old Taek Jho Low!  Sarawak Report is therefore entitled to question certain matters that are hard to explain, unless Jho Low is still being supported by 1MDB. Key queries include:  – Was the US$100 million upfront investment by Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz’s company Red Granite Productions in the film Wolf of Wall Street in any way financed or guaranteed by 1MDB?  – Does Jho Low’s lavish expenditure on entertainment, which has broken records in nightclubs in many of the world’s most expensive hot spots, owe in any way to support from Malaysia’s publicly funded sovereign wealth fund?  – Was the reason Jho Low gained a rare personal credit at the end of Wolf of Wall Street because it was he who financed the entire film project, as people who worked on the project understood was the case?  – Since Jho Low has been demonstrated as having employed a guarantee from 1MDB to back his personal buy-out attempt of a London hotel group, is it not fair to conclude that Jho Low is in fact an agent for the fund and is acting to transfer this public money into private hands abroad rather than investing it in Malaysian development?  Libel?  When Sarawak Report first asked about the sources of Riza Aziz’s enormous funds, libel threats were issued by the Hollywood lawyers Loeb & Loeb, threatening immediate action unless the posts were removed.  The posts were neither removed nor amended and four months later the threats have not been carried out.  Indeed it is now Loeb & Loeb who are removed from the brief and Red Granite Productions have hired a separate legal team.  A subpoena is believed to exist for Riza Aziz’s financial records with the Hollywood wealth management company NKSFB, where his account manager is Debra Johnson.  Debra is the wife of Channing Johnson, who was the senior partner at Loeb & Loeb in charge of overseeing the legal threats against Sarawak Report by Red Granite Productions.

A further letter from Wynton dated 24 January 2011 stated that the financing for the offer had “in principle” been fully underwritten by Malaysian government-backed investment funds.” [Judge Richards – Paragraph 135-138]\n\nAs the above makes clear, however, despite the formal letter of support by 1 Malaysian (sic) Berhad, the UK shareholders did not feel confident it was a reliable offer.\n\nThe judge explains:\n\nMr Murphy on Mr Quinlan’s behalf described it as “pure fantasy … In an email dated 11 January 2011, after Mr McKillen had had his meeting in Doha on 9 January 2011, he wrote “my sense is that it is an offer that can’t really be delivered either in time or structure. The delivery of the Malaysian government bond is not guaranteed and the deal may end up in an open ended bridging situation because it does not have the proper financing. I also sense that some Malaysian government may have a political motive and that will naturally delay execution. I am conscious that on paper the Malaysian deal is better to me personally, however, we should be looking at credibility and execution”. Mr McLaughlin was of the same view. Even Mr Buchanan was not confident that Wynton would deliver”\n\nThe comments show a devastating lack of confidence by these top businessmen in the credibility of Jho Low and also the Malaysian Government.\n\nHowever, it confirms that the offer referred to by Justice Richards had been placed on the table with the written backing of 1MDB for a bid of just over £1billion pounds.\n\nDenials\n\nContrast this enormous commitment with the series of denials, as all concerned have sought to distance 1MDB from the controversial night-clubbing pal of Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz.\n\n“The role of Jho Low as far as 1MDB is concerned is zero,” said 1MDB CEO Datuk Shahrol Halmi, denying that Low has received compensation for his previous role in the firm. [ Malaysia online ]\n\nDespite this, in company CV’s Low does acknowledge links to unspecified sovereign wealth funds.\n\nThe line appears to be that his investors are all from the Middle East and are the parents of kids he made friends with at school in the UK and US.\n\nIt’s a pity that Jho Low’s most famous and closest acquaintance appears to be the fellow Malaysian Riza Aziz, whose Dad is the PM and head of 1MDB from which billions are currently inadequately accounted for.\n\nTime to stop hiding the truth\n\nWith so much information now contradicting the party-loving Jho Low’s various versions of his life story, leading from college grad to major tycoon in no time flat, it is time for the truth.\n\nThe Chairman of 1MDB, Prime Minister Najib Razak, should explain transparently exactly which projects the fund has supported or offered to support, rather than relying on the pathetically over-due annual report that came out last week, which admits merely that the money is being invested by an anonymous fund manager in the Cayman Islands on anonymous projects with no guarantees whatsoever that the funds are secure!\n\nThese are billions of ringgit of public money borrowed at high interest rates supposedly to invest in Malaysian development.\n\nYet the money has gone no where near Malaysia and no no one is telling where it is or what it is being used for.\n\nIt is even being invested at a lower rate of interest than Najib borrowed it for in the first place!\n\nWe have questions\n\nThe only exception to this news blackout about what has happened to all this borrowed public money has come from the evidence we have now obtained from this British law case, showing that back in 2011 1MDB funds were offered to secure the purchase of some London Hotels by a private company owned by 26 year old Taek Jho Low!\n\nSarawak Report is therefore entitled to question certain matters that are hard to explain, unless Jho Low is still being supported by 1MDB. Key queries include:\n\n– Was the US$100 million upfront investment by Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz’s company Red Granite Productions in the film Wolf of Wall Street in any way financed or guaranteed by 1MDB?\n\n– Does Jho Low’s lavish expenditure on entertainment, which has broken records in nightclubs in many of the world’s most expensive hot spots, owe in any way to support from Malaysia’s publicly funded sovereign wealth fund?\n\n– Was the reason Jho Low gained a rare personal credit at the end of Wolf of Wall Street because it was he who financed the entire film project, as people who worked on the project understood was the case?\n\n– Since Jho Low has been demonstrated as having employed a guarantee from 1MDB to back his personal buy-out attempt of a London hotel group, is it not fair to conclude that Jho Low is in fact an agent for the fund and is acting to transfer this public money into private hands abroad rather than investing it in Malaysian development?\n\nLibel?\n\nWhen Sarawak Report first asked about the sources of Riza Aziz’s enormous funds, libel threats were issued by the Hollywood lawyers Loeb & Loeb, threatening immediate action unless the posts were removed.\n\nThe posts were neither removed nor amended and four months later the threats have not been carried out.\n\nIndeed it is now Loeb & Loeb who are removed from the brief and Red Granite Productions have hired a separate legal team.\n\nA subpoena is believed to exist for Riza Aziz’s financial records with the Hollywood wealth management company NKSFB, where his account manager is Debra Johnson.\n\nDebra is the wife of Channing Johnson, who was the senior partner at Loeb & Loeb in charge of overseeing the legal threats against Sarawak Report by Red Granite Productions.', 'authorsList': ['Sarawak Report'], 'description': "For well over a year Malaysia's mystery tycoon, Taek Jho Low has been adamantly denying his links with the shadowy sovereign wealth fund 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).", 'probability': 0.98888516, 'canonicalUrl': 'http://www.sarawakreport.org/2014/05/1mdb-backed-jho-low-with-uk1billion-exclusive-expose/', 'datePublished': '2014-05-02T00:00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-8 article">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class="top-image" width="750" height="450" src="/cache/e/7/8/1/0/e7810e929dfd08a18833787173b7c5439575ce55.jpg%20" alt="1MDB Backed Jho Low\'s £1Billion London Hotel Bid!

In mid-December 2010, advisers to Wynton made an indicative offer for </em><em>the shares of the company. Mr McKillen [a shareholder] met Jho Low and his advisers at Claridge’s </em><em>on 29 December 2010. A revised letter of intent was sent to the shareholders on 3 </em><em>January 2011, proposing an acquisition of all the shares on the basis of an enterprise </em><em>value of £1 billion, subject to due diligence and agreement of documentation </em><em>including warranties and indemnities. An accompanying letter from a Malaysian </em><em>Bank indicated that it was intended to seek to raise up to £950 million of debt and/or </em><em>mezzanine finance and £50-£100 million of equity……The provision on<strong> 15 January 2011 of a letter </strong></em><strong><em>from 1 Malaysian Berhad, an investment vehicle wholly owned by the Malaysian </em></strong><em><strong>government, confirming its support for the offer</strong>, did not allay the concerns of the </em><em>majority of the shareholders. A further letter from Wynton dated 24 January 2011 </em><em>stated that</em><strong><em>the financing for the offer had “in principle” been fully underwritten by </em><em>Malaysian government-backed investment funds.”\xa0</em></strong><em>[Judge Richards – Paragraph 135-138]</em></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>As the above makes clear, however, despite the formal letter of support by 1 Malaysian (sic) Berhad, the UK shareholders did not feel confident it was a reliable offer.</p>\n\n<p>The judge explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><em> Mr Murphy on Mr Quinlan’s behalf described it as “pure fantasy …\xa0In an email dated 11 January </em><em>2011, after Mr McKillen had had his meeting in Doha on 9 January 2011, he wrote \xa0“my sense is that it is an offer that can’t really be delivered either in time or structure. The delivery of the Malaysian government bond is not guaranteed and the deal may end up in an open ended bridging situation because it does not have the proper financing. I also sense that some Malaysian government may have a political motive and that will naturally delay execution. I am conscious that on paper the Malaysian deal is better to me personally, however, we should be looking at credibility and execution”. Mr McLaughlin was of the same view. Even Mr Buchanan was not confident that Wynton would deliver”</em></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The comments show a devastating lack of confidence by these top businessmen in the credibility of Jho Low and also the Malaysian Government.</p>\n\n<p>However, it confirms that the offer referred to by Justice Richards had been placed on the table with the written backing of 1MDB for a bid of just over £1billion pounds.</p>\n\n<h2>Denials</h2>\n\n<p>Contrast this enormous commitment with the series of denials, as all concerned have sought to distance 1MDB from the controversial night-clubbing pal of Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><em>“The role of Jho Low as far as 1MDB is concerned is zero,” said 1MDB CEO Datuk Shahrol Halmi, denying that Low has received compensation for his previous role in the firm.

Carel	Standard Bank	Organization	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/09/terrorism-money-laundering-know-your-customer-financial-inclusion	When people in developing countries don’t have access to a bank account, physical proximity to a bank is usually the first challenge that springs to mind, but sometimes the reason a person is unable to access a secure place to store their savings is as simple as them not having a piece of paper to prove who they are.  Banking regulations vary between countries, and some allow banks to set their own rules about what proof of identity they accept for new customers to make sure no one is excluded. In South Africa Standard Bank accepts a letter verifying a person’s address from a tribal chief for certain accounts, while Postbank offers a Mzansi account, which does not require any proof of address but only offers basic transactional services and has a balance limit of 25,000 South African Rand (£1,362).  However, international banking standards set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Taskforce recommend that people opening an account provide specific documents. These “know your customer” (KYC) guidelines are not new, and have prevented poorer communities from accessing bank accounts for years. But there is increasing concern that KYC is becoming more restrictive, making access to finance harder for local banks and populations and damaging developing economies’ opportunity to grow.  KYC requires banks to check that potential customers are not involved in money laundering or terrorism by providing a verified proof of identity and address when opening an account. This is difficult for people living in informal housing or rural areas, who rarely have utility bills or lease agreements as proof.  Richard Ketley, director of international economics consultancy firm Genesis Analytics, says although South Africa allows its banks to offer simple accounts without proof of address, some banks have ceased offering them because they were unprofitable. He says the South African government has also failed to address the needs of migrant communities, who do not have identification documents. Not having a bank account means people risk losing their savings and makes them targets for criminals.  “In many lower-income markets research shows poor people are enormously exposed to loss of savings through theft,” he says. “They keep money under the bed, get robbed, the house burns down, or they bury money and someone else digs it up.”  Instead of loosening KYC criteria to improve financial inclusion, however, banks are tightening implementation more than ever before. Three years ago, partly in response to the global financial crisis, the Financial Action Taskforce recommended that countries toughen sanctions against banks that fail to deliver on anti money-laundering and terrorism checks. In August 2014, Standard Chartered had to pay $300m to the New York State Department of Financial Services after its screening systems failed to spot suspicious transactions in UAE. As a result, the bank closed thousands of accounts with small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the country.  Closing such international accounts, known as ‘derisking’, hurts developing countries because without relationships with big international banks, accessing finance for importing and exporting goods and transferring money abroad becomes harder and more expensive. Roy Melnick, an associate director working on money laundering for PwC South Africa, says the global standards for safeguarding are there for good reasons, but derisking disproportionately affects innocent people. “Probably 99.9% of the population is law-abiding, it’s that 0.1% that make it so much more difficult for the rest,” he says.  Banks have become particularly cautious of money transfer services such as Western Union, which are perceived as particularly open to abuse. Somalia has no formal banking service, so when Barclays Bank tried to close its Somali MSB services in 2013, removing the only money transfer service available in the country, it faced outcry. The issue was taken to the high court, which ruled Barclaysmust continue its Somali banking services. The example illustrates how vulnerable some countries are.  The cost of meeting regulations is another reason banks are increasingly closing international relationships. Banks have to prove annually they have sufficient money laundering and terrorism prevention procedures in place for every bank with which they connect. According to KYC Exchange Net AG managing director Joachim von Hänisch, this can cost the bank £10,000 for each reporting process. The bank running the checks also incurs expenses. “If a bank isn’t making enough money from a relationship with another bank then it’s simply not worthwhile,” he says. Banks see derisking as a simpler solution.  Hänisch’s company addresses the problem by encouraging banks to use a standard, online reporting platform, KEN, that enables local banks to produce a single report a year. Three international banks have already signed up to the system since it launched in January 2014. Hänisch says it saves banks time and money, and could dissuade them from closing relationships.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also trying to tackle the problem. As a non-commercial entity, it finances trade in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but carries the risk itself. Deputy director of financial institutions Rudolf Putz says in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Armenia, EBRD is one of the few international institutions still providing trade finance facilities. “We have sufficient staff and money to analyse and take risk, which commercial banks would not be able to do,” he says.  He is concerned that if countries are unable to access trade finance from international banks, people will be forced to manage money in riskier ways. Ironically, this is exactly what KYC set out to prevent.

In South Africa <a href="http://www.standardbank.co.za/standardbank/" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Standard Bank</a> accepts a <a href="http://www.standardbank.co.za/standardbank/Personal/Banking-regulation/FICA/Adult-individuals" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">letter</a> verifying a person’s address from a tribal chief for certain accounts, while Postbank offers a <a href="http://www.postbank.co.za/Products/Transactional/mzansi.html" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Mzansi account</a>, which does not require any proof of address but only offers basic transactional services and has a balance limit of 25,000 South African Rand (£1,362).</p>\n<p>However, international banking standards set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Taskforce recommend that people opening an account provide <a href="http://http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/fatfrecommendations/documents/fatf-recommendations.html" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">specific documents</a>. These “know your customer” (KYC) guidelines are not new, and have prevented poorer communities from accessing bank accounts for years. But there is increasing concern that KYC is becoming more restrictive, making access to finance harder for local banks and populations and damaging developing economies’ opportunity to grow.<br></p>\n<p> KYC requires banks to check that potential customers are not involved in money laundering or terrorism by providing a verified proof of identity and address when opening an account. This is difficult for people living in informal housing or rural areas, who rarely have utility bills or lease agreements as proof. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> Richard Ketley, director of international economics consultancy firm <a href="http://www.genesis-analytics.com/" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Genesis Analytics</a>, says although South Africa allows its banks to offer simple accounts without proof of address, some banks have ceased offering them because they were unprofitable. He says the South African government has also failed to address the needs of migrant communities, who do not have identification documents. Not having a bank account means people risk losing their savings and makes them targets for criminals. </p>\n<p>“In many lower-income markets research shows poor people are enormously exposed to loss of savings through theft,” he says. “They keep money under the bed, get robbed, the house burns down, or they bury money and someone else digs it up.” <br></p>\n<p> Instead of loosening KYC criteria to improve financial inclusion, however, banks are tightening implementation more than ever before. Three years ago, partly in response to the global financial crisis, the Financial Action Taskforce recommended that countries <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf%20http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">toughen sanctions </a>against banks that fail to deliver on anti money-laundering and terrorism checks.

As a result, the bank closed thousands of accounts with small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the country.</p>\n<aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded" data-component="rich-link" data-link-name="rich-link-3 | 2">\n<div class="rich-link">\n<div class="rich-link__container">\n<div class="rich-link__header">\n<h2 class="rich-link__title">Do banks matter in developing countries?</h2>\n</div>\n<div class="rich-link__read-more">\n<div class="rich-link__arrow">\n<span class="inline-arrow-in-circle inline-icon ">\n<svg width="24" height="24" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="inline-arrow-in-circle__svg inline-icon__svg">\n<path class="rich-link__arrow-icon" d="M12 0C5.373 0 0 5.373 0 12s5.373 12 12 12 12-5.373 12-12S18.627 0 12 0m.21 19l-.637-.668 4.888-6.326H4.996v-1.01h11.465l-4.888-6.333.637-.668L19 11.153v.685l-6.79 7.157" fill-rule="evenodd"></path>\n</svg> </span>\n</div>\n<div class="rich-link__read-more-text">\nRead more\n</div>\n</div>\n<a class="rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/04/do-banks-matter-financial-inclusion" aria-label="Do banks matter in developing countries?"></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>Closing such international accounts, known as ‘derisking’, hurts developing countries because without relationships with big international banks, accessing finance for importing and exporting goods and transferring money abroad becomes harder and more expensive. Roy Melnick, an associate director working on money laundering for PwC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">South Africa</a>, says the global standards for safeguarding are there for good reasons, but derisking disproportionately affects innocent people. “Probably 99.9% of the population is law-abiding, it’s that 0.1% that make it so much more difficult for the rest,” he says.</p>\n<p> Banks have become particularly cautious of money transfer services such as <a href="http://www.westernunion.co.uk/gb/Home.page" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Western Union</a>, which are perceived as particularly open to abuse. Somalia has no formal banking service, so when Barclays Bank tried to close its Somali MSB services in 2013, removing the only money transfer service available in the country, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23030943" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">it faced outcry</a>. The issue was taken to the high court, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/nov/05/somali-remittances-dahabshiil-barclays-bank" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">ruled Barclays<strong> </strong>must continue</a> its Somali banking services. The example illustrates how vulnerable some countries are.</p>\n<p> The cost of meeting regulations is another reason banks are increasingly closing international relationships. Banks have to prove annually they have sufficient money laundering and terrorism prevention procedures in place for every bank with which they connect. According to KYC Exchange Net AG managing director Joachim von Hänisch, this can cost the bank £10,000 for each reporting process. The bank running the checks also incurs expenses. “If a bank isn’t making enough money from a relationship with another bank then it’s simply not worthwhile,” he says. Banks see derisking as a simpler solution.</p>\n<p> Hänisch’s company addresses the problem by encouraging banks to use a standard, online reporting platform, <a href="https://www.kyc-exchange.net/" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">KEN</a>, that enables local banks to produce a single report a year. Three international banks have already signed up to the system since it launched in January 2014. Hänisch says it saves banks time and money, and could dissuade them from closing relationships.</p>\n<p> The <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/home" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (EBRD) is also trying to tackle the problem. As a non-commercial entity, it finances trade in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but carries the risk itself.

'articleBodyHtml': '<article>\n\n<p>When people in developing countries don’t have access to a bank account, physical proximity to a bank is usually the first challenge that springs to mind, but sometimes the reason a person is unable to access a secure place to store their savings is as simple as them not having a piece of paper to prove who they are.</p>\n\n<p>Banking regulations vary between countries, and some allow banks to set their own rules about what proof of identity they accept for new customers to make sure no one is excluded. In South Africa <a href="http://www.standardbank.co.za/standardbank/" data-link-name="in body link">Standard Bank</a> accepts a <a href="http://www.standardbank.co.za/standardbank/Personal/Banking-regulation/FICA/Adult-individuals" data-link-name="in body link">letter</a> verifying a person’s address from a tribal chief for certain accounts, while Postbank offers a <a href="http://www.postbank.co.za/Products/Transactional/mzansi.html" data-link-name="in body link">Mzansi account</a>, which does not require any proof of address but only offers basic transactional services and has a balance limit of 25,000 South African Rand (£1,362).</p>\n\n<p>However, international banking standards set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Taskforce recommend that people opening an account provide <a href="http://http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/fatfrecommendations/documents/fatf-recommendations.html" data-link-name="in body link">specific documents</a>. These “know your customer” (KYC) guidelines are not new, and have prevented poorer communities from accessing bank accounts for years. But there is increasing concern that KYC is becoming more restrictive, making access to finance harder for local banks and populations and damaging developing economies’ opportunity to grow.<br></p>\n\n<p>KYC requires banks to check that potential customers are not involved in money laundering or terrorism by providing a verified proof of identity and address when opening an account. This is difficult for people living in informal housing or rural areas, who rarely have utility bills or lease agreements as proof.</p>\n\n<p>Richard Ketley, director of international economics consultancy firm <a href="http://www.genesis-analytics.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Genesis Analytics</a>, says although South Africa allows its banks to offer simple accounts without proof of address, some banks have ceased offering them because they were unprofitable. He says the South African government has also failed to address the needs of migrant communities, who do not have identification documents. Not having a bank account means people risk losing their savings and makes them targets for criminals.</p>\n\n<p>“In many lower-income markets research shows poor people are enormously exposed to loss of savings through theft,” he says. “They keep money under the bed, get robbed, the house burns down, or they bury money and someone else digs it up.” <br></p>\n\n<p>Instead of loosening KYC criteria to improve financial inclusion, however, banks are tightening implementation more than ever before. Three years ago, partly in response to the global financial crisis, the Financial Action Taskforce recommended that countries <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf%20http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">toughen sanctions </a>against banks that fail to deliver on anti money-laundering and terrorism checks. In August 2014, Standard Chartered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/20/standard-chartered-fined-300m-money-laundering-compliance" data-link-name="in body link">had to pay $300m</a> to the New York State Department of Financial Services after its screening systems failed to spot suspicious transactions in UAE. As a result, the bank closed thousands of accounts with small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Closing such international accounts, known as ‘derisking’, hurts developing countries because without relationships with big international banks, accessing finance for importing and exporting goods and transferring money abroad becomes harder and more expensive. Roy Melnick, an associate director working on money laundering for PwC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">South Africa</a>, says the global standards for safeguarding are there for good reasons, but derisking disproportionately affects innocent people. “Probably 99.9% of the population is law-abiding, it’s that 0.1% that make it so much more difficult for the rest,” he says.</p>\n\n<p>Banks have become particularly cautious of money transfer services such as <a href="http://www.westernunion.co.uk/gb/Home.page" data-link-name="in body link">Western Union</a>, which are perceived as particularly open to abuse. Somalia has no formal banking service, so when Barclays Bank tried to close its Somali MSB services in 2013, removing the only money transfer service available in the country, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23030943" data-link-name="in body link">it faced outcry</a>. The issue was taken to the high court, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/nov/05/somali-remittances-dahabshiil-barclays-bank" data-link-name="in body link">ruled Barclaysmust continue</a> its Somali banking services. The example illustrates how vulnerable some countries are.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of meeting regulations is another reason banks are increasingly closing international relationships. Banks have to prove annually they have sufficient money laundering and terrorism prevention procedures in place for every bank with which they connect. According to KYC Exchange Net AG managing director Joachim von Hänisch, this can cost the bank £10,000 for each reporting process. The bank running the checks also incurs expenses. “If a bank isn’t making enough money from a relationship with another bank then it’s simply not worthwhile,” he says. Banks see derisking as a simpler solution.</p>\n\n<p>Hänisch’s company addresses the problem by encouraging banks to use a standard, online reporting platform, <a href="https://www.kyc-exchange.net/" data-link-name="in body link">KEN</a>, that enables local banks to produce a single report a year. Three international banks have already signed up to the system since it launched in January 2014. Hänisch says it saves banks time and money, and could dissuade them from closing relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/home" data-link-name="in body link">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (EBRD) is also trying to tackle the problem. As a non-commercial entity, it finances trade in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but carries the risk itself. Deputy director of financial institutions Rudolf Putz says in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Armenia, EBRD is one of the few international institutions still providing trade finance facilities. “We have sufficient staff and money to analyse and take risk, which commercial banks would not be able to do,” he says.</p>\n\n<p>He is concerned that if countries are unable to access trade finance from international banks, people will be forced to manage money in riskier ways. Ironically, this is exactly what KYC set out to prevent.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2017-10-06T08:15:33-0400', 'datePublishedRaw': '2015-02-09T09:22:52-0500'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	Good for detecting money laundering but bad for poor people	Wanting		Terrorism, fines and money laundering: why banks say no to poor customers

A crowd gathered around the Tom Green County Courthouse steps on the cloudy Monday afternoon as John "Nick" Hanna made the announcement.  "I retired (from the Texas Rangers) because I wanted to bring my experience in tough situations, my judgement and my West Texas character and values," Hanna said. "I wanted to bring it home to Tom Green County where I could focus specifically on this county."  Hanna, if elected, plans to continue high standards for the sheriff's office and said he looks forward to the challenges ahead.  The career of Texas Ranger John "Nick" Hanna  Hanna started his long career in law enforcement with the Big Spring Police Department in 1989 before eventually moving on to the Department of Public Safety. He stayed with DPS for 24 years, 16 of which were with Ranger Company "E."  In that 16 year span, Hanna would become well-known in a case that rocked the country. At Eldorado in 2008, the YFZ Ranch was raided in a case involving the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints group and child sexual assault.  At the time of the initial distress call, he was the closest Ranger. In a 2018 interview, Hanna revealed his experience in the huge case.  "To this day, I’m still super proud of our State, Eldorado and San Angelo, and of course the Rangers, and our many law enforcement partners for interrupting a culture of sexual abuse in the FLDS community, which other states hadn’t been able to accomplish."

Carel	Chua Kim Leng	Individual	https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/mas-banks-working-on-new-tech-to-help-fight-against-money-laundering-terrorism	SINGAPORE - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has intensified efforts to stamp out money laundering and terrorism financing, but more could still be done, assistant managing director Chua Kim Leng said on Thursday (July 27).  Mr Chua told a financial crime seminar organised by the Association of Banks in Singapore that stepping up such efforts is ever more important today as criminals are constantly finding more creative ways to perpetrate crimes, be it laundering money, financing terrorism or weapons proliferation, or engaging in fraud or insider trading.  Technology can help, he added, noting that the MAS is working closely with a group of banks in Singapore that have come together to build a joint utility for Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.  "Robust KYC processes are the frontline of our defences. The utility... can free up resources and allow banks to focus on the more complex aspects of customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, including monitoring and investigating unusual and suspicious transactions," he said.  "A well-designed and well-executed utility can also offer efficiencies of scale and reduce the need for customers to provide the same information to multiple institutions."  Such a utility is pertinent, as the MAS has observed, through the course of its supervisory work and industry engagement, that one common way criminals get their funds into the financial system is by abusing offshore companies and investment funds.  "A small number of individuals may use trust and company service providers to set up a large number of corporate structures in multiple countries. Many of these are shell companies with no apparent economic purpose," he said.  These companies and investment funds open numerous bank accounts in different jurisdictions, then move large sums of money back and forth among themselves.  Such "layering" and "pass-through" methods are used to disguise the origin and ultimate destination of the money, as well as the true beneficiaries and purpose of these transactions.  And so banks need to know their customers well, and be alert to patterns, behaviours and transactions that are inconsistent with what they know of their customers' wealth, business and risk profile, because these could potentially be tell-tale signs of illicit activities, Mr Chua said.  He added that there is also room in the area of transactions monitoring and, here, technology could also help.  Current systems largely flag out transactions based on pre-set rules, thresholds and scenarios, which generate a high rate of false positives. These alerts require extensive human effort to review.  "Throwing more 'warm bodies' at the problem is not a sustainable solution," he said.  "This is where better use of technology can help. The next generation of surveillance systems utilise sophisticated, techniques, such as machine learning, which can help identify unusual patterns of transactions across a network of entities and across time."

Speaking at centenary celebrations of Kirloskar Brothers, he said the attempt was to allow the industry to create wealth fearlessly in a transparent environment where there are no obstacles.  In this endeavour, the government is attempting to rid the industry of web of laws, the Prime Minister said, adding during the past five years his government has worked honestly.  The attempt has been to bring transparency, efficiency and accountability in tax system, and reduce human interface with the tax department, he said.  Also, corporate tax has been reduced to their lowest so as to propel corporates to invest, he said.  The Prime Minister asked industry to shun pessimism, saying the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with India Inc in its attempt to expand business in any nook and corner of the country.

Carel	Carolyn Campbell	Individual	https://qz.com/244567/one-statistic-illustrates-the-promise-and-peril-of-investing-in-africa/	Carolyn Campbell, founding partner of a $2 billion private equity fund focused on Africa, is bullish about the continent and quick to note that 14 African countries have better ratings on public integrity (pdf) than India, while 35 are seen as less corrupt than Russia, generating favorable comparisons with two other fast-growing economies seen as more welcoming to foreign investors than Africa.  But one thing Campbell says that her fund, Emerging Capital Partners, can’t do is fill the massive gap in public investment in basic infrastructure: Europe, rebuilding after the devastation of World War II, spent 8% of its GDP on infrastructure. Today, China and India spend between 6% and 7%, while more mature economies spend about 3%. African countries average just 2% of public spending on infrastructure.  These types of comparisons aren’t easy to make across countries or time periods of fluctuating public spending; here’s a more granular view produced by McKinsey in January 2013, with Africa’s spending rolled into the Middle East:  For investors like Campbell, this deficit can be seen as an opportunity. Africa’s growth leaders, including Nigeria, Ghana, Mozambique, and Ethiopia, are set to expand their economies at rates of 6% or more this year—and that’s with relative underinvestment in infrastructure.  This week, African leaders have gathered in Washington for several days of talks with US officials, with the hopes of encouraging more foreign investment, particularly for electricity generation in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of the population lacks access to power. Not coincidentally, the summit’s other main theme is reducing corruption, including illicit financial flows made possible by US law. The challenge of infrastructure investment is that the public sector’s participation, the amount of cash involved and the propensity of such projects to go completely over-budget makes corruption a much bigger risk.  Managing the spending needed to make up this deficit, estimated at about $90 billion a year by the World Bank in 2010, and the vast differences in the providers of major infrastructure investment—from the China’s opaque investments and aid from Western governments to domestic tax dollars and private investment—will help determine whether African markets can replicate the miraculous catch-up growth seen in other developing countries.

Carel			https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/13001/use-location-intelligence-to-combat-financial-crime	Intelligence – artificial or real – is only as good as the information it uses. Location intelligence helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. How can location intelligence be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives to help combat financial crime?  Introduction  Intelligence (artificial or real) is only as good as the information it uses. A higher volume of relevant information provides deeper context to a situation, resulting in heightened intelligence, increased value, and better outcomes.  Location intelligence is a data asset that helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. This post considers how location intelligence can be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives, specifically fraud examination and forensic audit, to combat financial crime.  Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit  Fraud examination is the discipline of resolving allegations of fraud from tips, complaints, or accounting clues. It involves obtaining documentary evidence, interviewing witnesses and potential suspects, writing investigative reports, testifying to findings, and assisting in the general detection and prevention of fraud *.  Forensic audit is the process of investigation used to build a case that supports fraud examination. It is the intersection of financial principles and the law, and therefore, applies the following:  Technical skills of accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, and certain areas of the law and research; Investigative skills for the collection, analysis and evaluation of evidential matter; and Critical thinking to interpret and communicate the results of an investigation.  Points 2 and 3, above, are particularly relevant to this post. The collection and analysis of evidential matter needs a variety of data assets to support a comprehensive investigation. Critical thinking – sometimes referred to as lateral thinking, or thinking “outside the box” – is a disciplined approach to problem solving and guides our thought process and related actions. Critical thinking is required to contextualize patterns and connections across evidential matter.  Location Intelligence Is Context  Think about where you are right now. You may be at a specific address. If you have location services enabled on your phone, you are also located at specific coordinates relative to the rest of the world. However, the intelligence of your location is more than that.  The neighborhood that you are in can be characterized by demographics and consumer preferences. It also can be described in relation to the proximity of other neighborhoods that may have similar or very different characteristics. The people around you have mobile devices that are interacting with social media, streaming a live event, or making a purchase. Video is capturing movement, and machine sensors are analyzing usage and scheduling maintenance.  Location intelligence applies the multiple layers of information that surround you. The better you are able to logically connect these layers of information, the more location intelligence you have.  Back to Evidential Matter  Location intelligence continues to grow as a critical component of analytics, and it is being applied to more and more scenarios across industries through social media, connected devices, distributed systems, the internet of everything, and overlaying all of that with just about any dataset that can be collected.  In financial services, location intelligence provides an important and actionable level of information that ties together a customer profile, from on-boarding to know-your-customer and financial crime investigations. Referring back to Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit, above, location intelligence can be a critical component of evidential matter.  A Scenario  Party A is a bank customer that, by all accounts, is squeaky clean. Party A executes a financial transaction with Party B from a place Party A has never been to before. Party B registered their place of business as being in an upscale business park, but a satellite view shows that the actual location is in an abandoned industrial area. Party B makes many transactions with Party C that very closely correlates to the sum that was originally sent from Party A. Party C is located in very close proximity to a HIFCA designated zone. [To get a sense of what proximity risk is, look at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) and High Intensity Financial Crime Area (HIFCA).]  Should Party A be investigated? It is a questionable circumstance, at least.  As it relates to forensic audit, location intelligence provides additional layers of information that tighten the interrelationship among auditing, fraud examination and financial forensics in a dynamic way that adapts to political, social, and cultural pressures over time.  Summary  Fraud examination and forensic audit encompasses much more than just the review of financial data; it also involves techniques such as interviews, statement analyses, public records searches, and forensic document examination to identify questionable circumstances.  Location intelligence can help identify transaction anomalies more quickly, verify customer place of business visually and more efficiently, and flag sensitive cross-border conditions and proximity risk. All of these are vital in securing the proper documentation needed in a robust forensic examination.  *Notes:  The organization’s obligation is to report suspicious activity, not to stop it, by submitting a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report). There are two levels to this:  Level 1 - “The Sniff Test”: A questionable activity or a correlation of circumstances is identified (“Something seems fishy here”). Level 2 - Investigation: A disproportionate amount of time can be spent manually collecting supporting documentation. A good set of data access tools that links relevant data points, including location intelligence, can optimize this process, making it faster and with better quality.

Shakshi	Hassan Rouhani	Individual	https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/4/as-us-counts-votes-irans-rouhani-signals-tough-times-ahead	Tehran, Iran – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said it does not matter who wins a surprisingly tight US presidential election and that his country has planned for “difficult conditions” in the future.  In a televised speech on Wednesday, the Iranian leader said whoever the next president in Washington was, he should respect international treaties and laws.  “We want to be respected, not subject to sanctions [by the US]. No matter who wins the US election… What we want is for the US to return to law… to return to international and multilateral accords,” he said in reference to a nuclear deal Iran signed with world powers in 2015.  In May 2018, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the landmark deal and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran.  His Democratic challenger Joe Biden says he will return to the nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Iran in an effort to restart wider negotiations.  Rouhani on Wednesday said if the next US administration chooses to change course, that could change facts on the ground, but that Iran is not holding its breath and would prepare for the worst.  “We have planned based on the assumption that the methods and behaviours of the US will not return to the correct approach,” he said.  “If the Americans come to a realisation … that they must choose another way, so much the better. But if not, our decisions are based on how to run the country if conditions are difficult.”  Since abandoning the nuclear deal, Trump has followed a “maximum pressure” campaign that has blacklisted the entire Iranian financial sector.  The long sanctions have significantly damaged the Iranian economy, leading to sharp currency devaluation and high inflation.  Iran says it will not be pressured to renegotiate the nuclear deal and will adhere to all its commitments once the US lifts all sanctions and returns to the negotiating table.  In a speech on Tuesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the outcome of the US presidential elections would not affect Iranian policy towards the US.  “Some people talk about what will happen if this or that one is elected. Yes, certain events may happen but they don’t concern us. Our policy is calculated and clear.” he said.

Carel	Muhammad Ibrahim	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-malaysia-cenbank-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN1DM0DQ	KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has begun work on a regulatory structure for digital currencies such as bitcoin, its central bank governor said on Wednesday, aimed at further securing Malaysia against money-laundering and terrorism financing.  Governor Muhammad Ibrahim told a counter-terrorism financing summit that from next year those converting crypto currencies into conventional currency will be designated as “reporting institutions” under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act.  Reporting institutions are required by law to undertake preventive measures to prevent their firms from being used as a conduit for money laundering and terrorism financing activities, according to the central bank.  “This is to prevent the abuse of the system for criminal and unlawful activities and ensuring the stability and integrity of the financial system,” Muhammad said.  He did not say when the regulations would be finalised.  Commenting on terrorism financing in Malaysia, Muhammad said the total number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from financial institutions have increased this year.  In the first six months of this year, Malaysian authorities received 346 STRs related to terrorism financing which have led to 34 disclosures to law enforcement agencies, compared to 93 reports in 2015, the central bank governor said.  Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. The Southeast Asian country has been on high alert since suicide bombers and gunmen linked to Islamic State launched multiple attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in January 2016.  A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June last year wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, the first such attacks on Malaysian soil.  Meanwhile, Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the country has been sharing intelligence with Indonesia, Malaysia and others in the region for many years.  “Any information that we have that is relevant to the security of our friends in the region, we will share. My expectation is that will be reciprocated,” Keenan said at the summit.

Wanting	Carel: maybe adverse against Islamic State	Malaysia says working on regulatory framework for crypto currencies
Carel	OECD	Organization	https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/enforce-public-entities-corporate-governance-act-to-curb-corruption	Corruption Watch  ONE of the most progressive pieces of legislation to fight corruption is the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act (Chapter 10:31).  The law was enacted in 2018 to provide for the proper governance of public entities in order to comply with Chapter 9 of the Constitution, which speaks to principles of good public administration and leadership.  The Act also provides a uniform mechanism for regulating the conditions of service of members of public entities and their senior employees.  Section 194 of the Constitution outlines the basic values and principles governing public administration as follows:  A high standard of professional ethics;  Efficient and economical use of resources;  Development-oriented public administration;  Impartiality and fairness in the provision of services;  Public participation in policy-making;  Public administration which is accountable to Parliament and the people;  Cooperation between institutions and agencies of Government at all levels;  Provision of timely, accessible and accurate information;  Cultivating good human resource management and career development practices to maximise human potential;  Public administration broadly representative of the diverse communities of Zimbabwe; and Employment, training and advancement practices based on merit, ability, objectivity, fairness, the equality of men and women and inclusion of persons with disabilities.  I have repeatedly pointed out that the bulk of the job of fighting corruption would be accomplished by the mere implementation of these basic values and principles. Transparency and accountability are at the heart of all these values and principles. Transparency means that decisions taken and their enforcement are done in a manner that follows rules and regulations.  It also means that information is freely available and directly accessible to those who will be affected by such decisions and their enforcement.  It also means that enough information is provided, and that it is provided in easily understandable forms and media.  Accountability is a key requirement for the successful fight against corruption. Not only governmental institutions but also the private sector and civil society organisations must be accountable to the public and to their institutional stakeholders.  In general, an organisation or an institution is accountable to those who will be affected by its decisions or actions. Accountability cannot be enforced without transparency and the rule of law.  That is exactly what the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act is trying to achieve. I must applaud the Office of the President and Cabinet Corporate Governance Unit for championing reforms in public entities’ corporate governance practices.  These reforms are in line with global trends.  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), State-owned enterprises today account for over a fifth of the world’s largest enterprises as opposed to 10 years ago where only one or two of the enterprises could be found at the top of the league table.  This means that high standards of corporate governance of these entities are critical to ensure financial stability and sustain global growth.  One of the key reforms being actively considered by Government in order to bring sanity in State-owned enterprises is adopting the decentralised ownership model and move away from the current centralised ownership whereby line ministries act as the owners and regulatory authorities at the same time.  In its publication entitled, “Ownership and Governance of State-Owned Enterprises: A Compendium of National Practices (2018)”, the OECD says most of the countries it had surveyed had either adopted a centralised model for State ownership, had established a central holding company for an important portfolio of State-owned enterprises, or had established a central co-ordinating agency, often charged with monitoring performance or co-ordinating governance practices across the State-owned enterprise sector.  Some countries had a highly decentralised system, with the ownership of State-owned enterprises being exercised by a multitude of line ministries and no co-ordinating agency in place.  Adoption of this model in Zimbabwe may assist in addressing the issue of newly-appointed ministers moving quickly to dissolve State-owned enterprises boards and appointing their own people.  Mr Willard Manungo, the Secretary for State Enterprise Reform, Corporate Governance and Procurement, recently told a virtual meeting organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe, and the Public Accountants and Auditors Board that Government was cognisant of the need for continuous reform of the governance of State-owned enterprises by aligning laws that govern these entities with Section 2 of Second Schedule of Public Entities Corporate Governance Act, which includes separation of ownership functions from other State functions.  “This is popularly known as the decentralised governance model. This governance reform is already being implemented in various countries and it has reduced corruption practices in their State enterprises sector,” Mr Manungo said.  There are several provisions in the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act which if enforced can ensure the principles of public administration and leadership outlined above are given life.  The Act has provisions which promote disclosure and transparency, which are key provisions of an effective law in the fight against corruption.  Section 34 requires a member of a board or senior staff member of a public entity to disclose any interest they may have in any matter under board consideration. Section 11 requires full disclosure of members appointed to public entities boards with regard to qualifications, other boards they sit on and criteria of appointing them.  The list of all members with disclosures shall be kept up-to-date and available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times during the Ministry’s normal office hours.  Sections 13 (5) and 19 (6) require that a copy of model conditions of service and of any amendment or replacement be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the public entity.  Section 22 (4) requires that a copy of the strategic plan be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the unit and of the entity. Section 30 requires that Board Charters and Codes of Ethics be kept at the State Enterprise and Parastatal’s office, where they may be inspected by members of the public free of charge at all reasonable times during the entity’s business hours.  Part IV of Public Entities Corporate Governance (General) Regulations 2018, provides for the declaration of assets by board members and senior staff members of public entities. Another important provision is Section 23 (10) of the regulations which protect a board member or employee of a public entity who, in good faith, submits objections to questionable instructions.  Such officers who report on a questionable instruction shall not be dismissed or have their contract of appointment or employment terminated or any measure or sanction of a disciplinary nature on account of their objections to questionable instructions.  When it comes to investigations, Section 40 allows special investigations to be undertaken at any Public Entity with regards to affairs or dealings of the entity.  The investigations can take the form of forensic audits. This provision gives room for detecting any corrupt practices.  Governments make commitments to adopt international standards on fighting corruption. This has seen Zimbabwe ratify and domesticate standards enshrined in international conventions aimed at combating corruption and corruption-related offences.  In this regard, Zimbabwe is a signatory to the following corruption related Conventions: the United Nations Convention against Corruption (ratified on March 8, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (ratified on December 12, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (acceded to on July 20, 1993); the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (ratified on December 17, 2006); and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol against Corruption (ratified on October 8, 2004).  The adoption of the principles from these conventions is now part of the Zimbabwean law that deals with corruption.  Therefore, the legal framework is in line with international best practice in terms of fighting corruption.  These international commitments also send a positive signal on Government’s intention and seriousness in adopting international standards in fighting corruption.  The legal framework in Zimbabwe to fight corruption, which is aligned to internationally acceptable standards, provides basic benchmarks for an effective legal framework.  The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) will, however, continue to push for further legal reforms to ensure the legal framework is water-tight to curb corruption.  Mr Manungo is indeed correct when he says legislation has the effect of deterring corruption by making it costly to engage in corruption practices through surcharges, fines or custodial penalties.  And to ensure enforcement of any law, he says there should be strong institutions that have powers, skills and reputation to detect corruption and enforce the law.

I must applaud the Office of the President and Cabinet Corporate Governance Unit for championing reforms in public entities’ corporate governance practices.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms are in line with global trends.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), State-owned enterprises today account for over a fifth of the world’s largest enterprises as opposed to 10 years ago where only one or two of the enterprises could be found at the top of the league table.</p>\n\n<p>This means that high standards of corporate governance of these entities are critical to ensure financial stability and sustain global growth.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key reforms being actively considered by Government in order to bring sanity in State-owned enterprises is adopting the decentralised ownership model and move away from the current centralised ownership whereby line ministries act as the owners and regulatory authorities at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>In its publication entitled, “Ownership and Governance of State-Owned Enterprises: A Compendium of National Practices (2018)”, the OECD says most of the countries it had surveyed had either adopted a centralised model for State ownership, had established a central holding company for an important portfolio of State-owned enterprises, or had established a central co-ordinating agency, often charged with monitoring performance or co-ordinating governance practices across the State-owned enterprise sector.</p>\n\n<p>Some countries had a highly decentralised system, with the ownership of State-owned enterprises being exercised by a multitude of line ministries and no co-ordinating agency in place.</p>\n\n<p>Adoption of this model in Zimbabwe may assist in addressing the issue of newly-appointed ministers moving quickly to dissolve State-owned enterprises boards and appointing their own people.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Willard Manungo, the Secretary for State Enterprise Reform, Corporate Governance and Procurement, recently told a virtual meeting organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe, and the Public Accountants and Auditors Board that Government was cognisant of the need for continuous reform of the governance of State-owned enterprises by aligning laws that govern these entities with Section 2 of Second Schedule of Public Entities Corporate Governance Act, which includes separation of ownership functions from other State functions.</p>\n\n<p>“This is popularly known as the decentralised governance model. This governance reform is already being implemented in various countries and it has reduced corruption practices in their State enterprises sector,” Mr Manungo said.</p>\n\n<p>There are several provisions in the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act which if enforced can ensure the principles of public administration and leadership outlined above are given life.</p>\n\n<p>The Act has provisions which promote disclosure and transparency, which are key provisions of an effective law in the fight against corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Section 34 requires a member of a board or senior staff member of a public entity to disclose any interest they may have in any matter under board consideration. Section 11 requires full disclosure of members appointed to public entities boards with regard to qualifications, other boards they sit on and criteria of appointing them.</p>\n\n<p>The list of all members with disclosures shall be kept up-to-date and available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times during the Ministry’s normal office hours.</p>\n\n<p>Sections 13 (5) and 19 (6) require that a copy of model conditions of service and of any amendment or replacement be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the public entity.</p>\n\n<p>Section 22 (4) requires that a copy of the strategic plan be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the unit and of the entity. Section 30 requires that Board Charters and Codes of Ethics be kept at the State Enterprise and Parastatal’s office, where they may be inspected by members of the public free of charge at all reasonable times during the entity’s business hours.</p>\n\n<p>Part IV of Public Entities Corporate Governance (General) Regulations 2018, provides for the declaration of assets by board members and senior staff members of public entities. Another important provision is Section 23 (10) of the regulations which protect a board member or employee of a public entity who, in good faith, submits objections to questionable instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Such officers who report on a questionable instruction shall not be dismissed or have their contract of appointment or employment terminated or any measure or sanction of a disciplinary nature on account of their objections to questionable instructions.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to investigations, Section 40 allows special investigations to be undertaken at any Public Entity with regards to affairs or dealings of the entity.</p>\n\n<p>The investigations can take the form of forensic audits. This provision gives room for detecting any corrupt practices.</p>\n\n<p>Governments make commitments to adopt international standards on fighting corruption. This has seen Zimbabwe ratify and domesticate standards enshrined in international conventions aimed at combating corruption and corruption-related offences.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard, Zimbabwe is a signatory to the following corruption related Conventions: the United Nations Convention against Corruption (ratified on March 8, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (ratified on December 12, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (acceded to on July 20, 1993); the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (ratified on December 17, 2006); and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol against Corruption (ratified on October 8, 2004).</p>\n\n<p>The adoption of the principles from these conventions is now part of the Zimbabwean law that deals with corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the legal framework is in line with international best practice in terms of fighting corruption.</p>\n\n<p>These international commitments also send a positive signal on Government’s intention and seriousness in adopting international standards in fighting corruption.</p>\n\n<p>The legal framework in Zimbabwe to fight corruption, which is aligned to internationally acceptable standards, provides basic benchmarks for an effective legal framework.</p>\n\n<p>The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) will, however, continue to push for further legal reforms to ensure the legal framework is water-tight to curb corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Manungo is indeed correct when he says legislation has the effect of deterring corruption by making it costly to engage in corruption practices through surcharges, fines or custodial penalties.</p>\n\n<p>And to ensure enforcement of any law, he says there should be strong institutions that have powers, skills and reputation to detect corruption and enforce the law.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-11-01T12:08:10+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-11-01T00:00:49+00:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	Corporate Governance Act to curb corruption	Wanting		Enforce Public Entities Corporate Governance Act to curb corruption
Carel	Donald Trump	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-turkey/despite-trump-erdogan-ties-turkey-says-it-will-work-with-whoever-wins-u-s-vote-idUSKBN27M1QF	ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is ready to work with whoever wins the U.S. election, two top Turkish officials said on Friday, despite a friendship with President Donald Trump that has helped the two countries through turbulent times.  “Regardless of which candidate takes office in the U.S., we will pursue a sincere approach to improve our relations,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.  The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankara’s closer ties with Moscow, its ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and an erosion of rights in Turkey.  Cavusoglu said Turkey had worked with Democrat and Republican administrations alike and overcome difficulties with both.  He spoke as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took a narrow lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia, putting the White House within Biden’s reach as undecided states continued to count votes.  Washington has threatened sanctions on Turkey for purchasing Russian missile defence systems but Trump’s administration has avoided imposing sanctions.  “Of course, individuals have an impact, positive and negative. The sincere friendship between our president and Mr. Trump continued through the most difficult times,” Cavusoglu said.  Analysts say Turkey’s bilateral ties could suffer if Biden becomes U.S. president. The lira, which is already trading at a record low against the dollar, could come under more pressure.  However Erdogan’s top aide, Vice President Fuat Oktay, said Ankara was not afraid of sanctions.  “No country, including America, has the chance to implement a foreign policy, programme or policy in the region in spite of Turkey or by excluding Turkey,” Oktay told broadcaster A Haber.  “Turkey is no longer a country which shrinks from, or is scared of, sanctions. Sanctions would increase further our resolve and our determination,” he said.

Carel			https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/how-to-deal-with-aml-risks-from-a-fintech-partnership	Consumers today have more ways than ever to make financial transactions. We can secure a loan in minutes, have robots make investment decisions for us, and make payments using our smartphones and new currency types.  In the face of these advancements, banks and fintech companies are starting to collaborate, but that collaboration often fails to effectively address fundamental risks associated with money laundering and other financial crimes.  When a bank partners with a startup firm, the risks related to anti-money-laundering compliance have particularly attracted the attention of global financial services regulators. And all too often, bank leaders are nervous about pursuing a relationship or new account with a fintech company because of the AML and regulatory concerns. Monitoring a fintech partner over time can also amplify overhead spending. For example, internal AML systems often need to be adjusted to account for fintech data and relevant risks, and expanded resources may be needed to effectively perform and document ongoing due diligence of the fintech providers' adherence to AML roles and responsibilities.  Each of a bank's accounts, partnerships and other relationships with fintech companies is unique, and each requires thorough vetting and due diligence before the bank determines whether a fintech company fits into its culture, risk boundaries and strategy.  These three strategies can help banks manage AML concerns of working with a fintech partner.  Define Risk Appetite and Tolerance AML compliance officers should have discussions with their senior management teams and boards of directors about the impact of fintech on the traditional banking system and strategies related to the consideration of becoming partners with fintech companies. As opposed to establishing a blanket prohibition of certain types of customers, such as those processing third-party payment activity, the bank should consider the attributes, criteria and market compensation that it would find appropriate, and the infrastructure and resources that would be needed to effectively manage the risks associated with such companies.  Each time a new potential fintech relationship or other opportunity arises, it is far easier and more efficient to assess the new business opportunity against an existing board-approved statement of the bank's risk appetite and tolerance than it is for the compliance officer to chase down the personal opinion of key decision-makers throughout a bank.  Be Assertive Does the bank want access to the fintech company's customer data to better support transaction monitoring, customer risk rating, and sanctions screening? If so, the bank should ask for it directly. Fintech companies generally have a lot of data, and most are more than willing to share permissible information with banks if it means being able to retain a strategic banking relationship.  Better yet, the bank and fintech company should have a contractual agreement about the format, frequency and content of the data the fintech company would provide, and the bank should integrate the data directly into its AML systems. A seamless integration of data within a bank's AML systems can improve both efficiency and assurance that money laundering risks are being appropriately addressed.  Regulate Your Partners The bank needs to clearly define the AML requirements, roles and responsibilities that are expected of a fintech company that maintains an account with the bank. The two parties should develop a formal agreement stating those roles, and the bank should hold the fintech company to its contractual requirements.  An agreement could include such requirements for the fintech company to meet as retaining qualified AML compliance personnel, undergoing annual AML audits performed by a bank-approved and trusted vendor and supplying ongoing AML metrics related to agreed-upon AML performance or risk indicators. Banks that clearly define such responsibilities – and, more important, monitor adherence to them over time – are more likely to be able to monitor and respond effectively to changing AML risks or deteriorating AML controls in a timely manner.  Ideally, the depth, breadth and frequency of the bank's ongoing due diligence and testing will align with the areas of elevated risk the company presents.  The age of digital disruption in the financial services industry has only begun, but unfortunately many bankers and fintech companies are partnering without addressing the relevant risks. It is time for them to collaborate to tackle the emerging AML risks of the fintech boom.

Carel	Mark Kelly	Individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democrat-mark-kelly-defeats-republican-martha-mcsally-arizona-senate-race-n1246020	Democrat Mark Kelly has defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona, NBC News projected on Friday, giving Democrats a Senate pickup in the state.  Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, declared himself the winner earlier in the week.  "I am deeply honored that Arizonans have trusted me to be their next United States Senator and to serve in this seat once held by Senator John McCain," he said in a series of tweets Wednesday night.  "We woke up today still facing a pandemic, a struggling economy, and deep division in our country," he wrote. "We need to slow the spread of the virus, get our economy back on track, and defend health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And I know that together, we can."  Kelly, 56, is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in 2011 at a constituent event. The couple founded the Giffords Foundation, which supports gun control laws around the country.  The win puts both of the state’s Senate seats in the hands of Democrats - Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. Sinema congratulated Kelly in a tweeted statement Wednesday. "I am confident Mark will uphold the Arizona values of seeking common ground and putting country above party," she wrote.  The win solidifies Arizona’s swing-state status after years of Republican control, and comes as Democrats suffered a series of setbacks in their hopes of taking control of the Senate. They flipped one seat in Colorado, but lost another in Alabama and their big-money pushes aimed at unseating Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins in Maine both failed.  Although they held a seat in a tight race in Michigan, they're also trying to flip a seat where they're currently trailing in North Carolina and two seats in historically conservative Georgia, at least one of which is projected to head to a runoff on Jan. 5.  Kelly, in his first bid for public office, ran as a moderate who would be above the partisan bickering in Washington.  McSally was appointed to the seat in 2018 after the death of John McCain. Tuesday was a special election for the last two years of McCain’s term — the winner on Tuesday will have to run for re-election in two years — and was viewed as a must-win for Democrats' Senate hopes.  McSally trailed Kelly in the polls throughout the race and raised significantly less money.  McSally, a former Air Force pilot who opposed Donald Trump in 2016, found herself in a difficult position trying to hold on to the president’s base supporters while also appealing to moderates who would decide the election. McSally campaigned on multiple occasions with Trump and did little to distance herself from his administration.  Trump also created unique problems for McSally in Arizona because of his unpopularity with older voters, suburban voters and Mormons, key voting groups in the state. The Republican Party’s relative stability among some Hispanic voters also did not benefit McSally quite as much in Arizona, where most of the fast-growing Hispanic population is Mexican American, a group that tends to be less conservative than Cuban Americans.  McSally argued that despite Kelly’s independent rhetoric, he would vote to advance a liberal agenda if he were elected, echoing an attack Trump frequently used against Joe Biden and calling him “counterfeit Kelly.”  Kelly repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would vote for Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, to be majority leader if the party takes control of the Senate, and refused to stake out a position on whether he would vote to eliminate the filibuster.  In his tweets Wednesday, Kelly said, "I am preparing for the job of being an independent voice for all Arizonans, regardless of who they voted for."

The couple founded the Giffords Foundation, which supports gun control laws around the country.</p>\n\n<p>The win puts both of the state’s Senate seats in the hands of Democrats<strong> - </strong>Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. Sinema congratulated Kelly in a <a href="https://twitter.com/kyrstensinema/status/1324004147948146691">tweeted statement</a> Wednesday. "I am confident Mark will uphold the Arizona values of seeking common ground and putting country above party," she wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The win solidifies Arizona’s swing-state status after years of Republican control, and comes as Democrats suffered<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-worry-waning-senate-prospects-threaten-big-ambitions-n1246478"> a series of setbacks</a> in their hopes of taking control of the Senate.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, to be majority leader if the party takes control of the Senate, and refused to stake out a position on whether he would vote to eliminate the filibuster.</p>\n\n<p>In his tweets Wednesday, Kelly said, "I am preparing for the job of being an independent voice for all Arizonans, regardless of who they voted for."</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-11-06T16:24:58.000Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-11-06T16:22:00.000Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	About politics	Wanting		Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Martha McSally in Arizona Senate race

Carel			https://securityintelligence.com/criminals-fraud-protection-offense-defense/	The Use of Offensive Tactics to Stop Fraud  Criminals engage organizations that manage customers’ assets in a “battle of wits”: They exploit technological and human weaknesses to commit financial crimes and fraud, leaving the organization and its customers holding the bag. A holistic approach to fraud protection should consider both offensive and defensive measures to combat criminals and fraud schemes. In part one of this two-part blog, we will explore the use of offensive tactics to stop fraud at the source.  Offense: Going for the Source of Fraudulent Transactions  The best way for a criminal to initiate a fraudulent transaction is in the shadow of a legitimate customer. This could be accomplished via a malware infection on a device that a legitimate customer uses to conduct business, a form filled with the victim’s stolen personal information or a phone call into an unsuspecting call center rep with the correct answers to security questions.  Seeing Fraud Coming Is Hard, but Preventing It from Taking Hold Is Harder  This is a pivotal moment in a fraud scheme. Preventing criminals from getting the fraud off the ground will reduce the amount of work needed to defend against fraud down the road. Delay would involve finding and verifying a fraudulent transaction among numerous genuine transactions.  Fraud protection at the source isn’t trivial because it is hard to consider all the possible ways in which fraudulent transactions can be created. It is even more difficult to extend the reach of the organization’s security measures in such a way that they can be present at the source of fraud. Thus, knowing a fraudulent transaction is coming is the next best thing.  Cyber Protection Is Key to Stopping Fraud at the Source  Customers can choose from many ways to engage the enterprise. The convenience and speed of online and mobile customer engagement channels has shifted a significant portion of offline customer activity to these channels. Also note the rapid adoption of online and mobile banking over the past few years.  With ease of use and convenience comes higher fraud risk, enabled by malware and phishing. These threats enable criminals to collect credentials and personal information and to operate undetected from customer devices. This data is used by criminals to operate in the “shadow” of the user when transacting across all channels.  Frustrate the Fraudsters by Making Fraud a Costly Endeavor  The organization can stop criminals from getting this valuable data by using a set of offensive measures, including malware and phishing protection, account takeover detection and more. Offense forces fraudsters to go back to the drawing board and change their tactics. This is costly and has real implications for their productivity. That said, offensive measures require up-to-date intelligence of criminal plans and tools. This evolving intelligence is essential to match their shifting tactics.  Fraud Protection: An Ounce of Offense Can Save You a Pound of Defense  Offense is a way to wreak havoc among cyber criminals. It reduces effective attack surface area and creates an early barrier that stops the attack before it reaches the enterprise back office. However, offense comes at a cost and requires highly flexible, intelligence-driven operations that can closely match criminals’ evasive maneuvers.  To create a truly holistic approach to fraud protection, strong offense must be complemented by effective defense. We will cover this in part two of this blog.

Carel	Coinbase	Organization	https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/how-fintech-can-win-on-financial-crime/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADbx16GxJHZ0c5i4Q2jgpKQghl3bOneL4TsLuWhf2F2YbVgoRYxYZNdbr7m3Z2jFxVRpJST3NF5XaV6JhFtQPzhHQ2wczx_zW7YgBiel5S45hLnr5udGJjpmsmCVH3sYG-mgkbfrGUwPGAWhenFcUV2KrkpGy85xhq6f6Aqjm3P5	Juan Zarate, a former Treasury official and now adviser to Coinbase, writes in his book Treasury’s War that “financial warfare…has started to form a central part of international security strategies.” By understanding the financial networks underpinning drug cartels, terrorist organizations and rogue nations, U.S. law enforcement and the Treasury Department have been able to pursue more sophisticated strategies aimed at disrupting them.  As a result of the widespread adoption of this approach, both in the U.S. and abroad, financial institutions around the world are held to higher standards than ever before with regard to detecting, reporting and mitigating financial crime. This is viewed by many businesses as a burdensome and costly task. Complaints about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls in particular are common. Fintech companies, however, ought to recognize an opportunity to seize a competitive advantage.  Banks are generally weak with regard to financial crimes compliance, including AML/KYC controls and related operations such as information security and fraud prevention. The Department of Justice, for example, recently stated that the controls at HSBC were so bad that revealing them could potentially cause “ serious criminal activity.” Some went so far as to question whether HSBC is so large and complex that it is inherently impossible to govern.  In an unrelated piece about the ongoing sanctions compliance issues at Standard Chartered, the Financial Times highlighted two major causes of the bank’s headaches: a culture of disdain for American banking regulations and poor technology. Cultural and technological failures are industry-wide characteristics in banking, and they present a ripe target for fintech to gain an advantage.  Financial crime prevention can broadly be said to consist of three parts: reporting, intelligence and enforcement. Enforcement is, and always will fall under, the purview of governmental agencies and thus should only interest businesses tangentially. Intelligence and reporting, however, are naturally interrelated functions and give rise to business concerns due to regulatory requirements. Without a sound idea of what activity merits reporting, many institutions blindly generate tens of thousands of reports annually, several of which are very low-quality and of little use to law enforcement.  A recent discussion of flaws in the United Kingdom’s AML laws pointed out that in that country, more than 350,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were filed in a year, resulting in law enforcement agencies being “overwhelmed.” This shotgun approach significantly reduces the value of reports in terms of mitigating risk to the institution, and often requires the mass hiring of expensive and often ineffective workers.  There are several reasons to think that fintech as an industry can and should do better. To begin with, regulators are beginning to pay more attention to their products and practices. John A. Cassara, a former Treasury Special Agent, recently wrote an excellent piece praising measures by the small African nation of Lesotho to regulate mobile payments and calling for the same in Western countries.  Innovative products in the financial space will ultimately run into regulators, and fintech companies need to be prepared for it. As Matt Levine wrote, “Tech is an industry of moving fast and breaking things. Finance is an industry of moving fast, breaking things, being mired in years of litigation, paying 10-digit fines, and ruefully promising to move slower and break fewer things in the future.”  But preparation aside, there are even greater advantages to be had by winning in this area.

Carel	Pondera Solutions	Organization	https://gigaom.com/2013/07/31/this-is-interesting-a-fraud-detection-company-built-on-googles-prediction-api/	If you thought Google’s Prediction API was just a handy tool for web programmers and weekend hackers, think again. A Folsom, Calif.-based startup called Pondera Solutions is pushing what it calls Fraud Detection as a Service, which is based on a variety of Google (s goog) services, including the Prediction API machine learning tool.  Pondera has actually been offering its service since November 2011, but this is the first I’ve heard of it. I spotted it in a Wednesday-morning Google Enterprise blog post announcing that the Iowa Workforce Development agency has selected Pondera to power its unemployment-fraud detection efforts. The agency’s system for analyzing unemployment claims highlights a portion of the Google services Pondera uses:  “With FDaaS, suspicious claims are proactively flagged by the system, which alerts IWD employees about potentially fraudulent claims. The claims are plotted on a heatmap built on Google Maps to identify areas with the highest fraud incidents and determine where to put more investigative resources. We also use Google Street View to check the validity of businesses that submit claims.”  Pondera’s website lays out the rest:  Google’s data centers, where FDaaS runs, which allow for immense scalability without the need to purchase on-premise hardware or software. Because FDaaS is in the cloud, unexpected spikes in UI claims can be handled without system failure or processing time lags. Google’s Prediction API, which trains, tunes and updates prediction models that check individual claims for anomalies or suspicious activities. Google prediction technologies discover and report trends, patterns, clusters, and other variables. Google Big Query, which mines large amounts of transaction data to uncover previously undetected patterns and trends. Google App Engine, which identifies factors such as UI claimants who have been rehired, those who may be using a fraudulent identity, and computers that have been previously used in fraudulent claims. Google Search Appliance (GSA), which aids investigation of potential fraud or improper payments across both structured and unstructured data. Analysts and investigators can research cases using the GSA’s intuitive, familiar Google search box.  Actually, this isn’t the first time Google’s Prediction API has been publicly cited as the basis for some real-world work. In 2011, Ford Motor Co. discussed how it was using the service to predict drivers’ behavior based on the data that cars’ sensors have captured in the past.

Shakshi	Hassan Rouhani	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Rouhani	"Rouhani" redirects here. For other persons with this surname, see Rouhani (surname).  "Rohani" redirects here. For the village in Iran, see Rohani, Iran.  (Persian: حسن روحانی‎, Standard Persian pronunciation: (listen); born Hassan Fereydoun (Persian: حسن فریدون [7] [8] is an Iranian politician serving as the seventh and current President of Iran since 3 August 2013. He was also a lawyer, [9] academic, former diplomat and Islamic cleric. He has been a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts since 1999, [10] member of the Expediency Council since 1991, [11] and a member of the Supreme National Security Council since 1989. [6] [12] Rouhani was deputy speaker of the fourth and fifth terms of the Parliament of Iran (Majlis) and Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council from 1989 to 2005. [6] In the latter capacity, he was the country's top negotiator with the EU three, UK, France, and Germany, on nuclear technology in Iran, and has also served as a Shia mujtahid (a senior cleric), [13] and economic trade negotiator. [14] [15]:138 He has expressed official support for upholding the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. [16] In 2013, he appointed former industries minister Eshaq Jahangiri as his first vice-president. [17]  On 7 May 2013, Rouhani registered for the presidential election that was held on 14 June 2013. [18] He said that, if elected, he would prepare a "civil rights charter", restore the economy and improve rocky relations with Western nations. [19] [20] Rouhani is frequently described as a moderate. He was elected as President of Iran on 15 June, defeating Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and four other candidates. [21] [22] [23] He took office on 3 August 2013. [24] In 2013, Time magazine named him in its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In domestic policy, he encourages personal freedom and free access to information, has improved women's rights by appointing female foreign ministry spokespeople, and has been described as a centrist and reformist who has improved Iran's diplomatic relations with other countries through exchanging conciliatory letters. [25] [26] [27] Rouhani won re-election in the 2017 election with 23,636,652 votes (57.1%). [28] He became the third Iranian President, after Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to win a presidential victory as an incumbent with an increased electoral mandate.  Name[ edit ]  He was born Hassan Fereydoun (or Fereydun, in reference to a just king in Persian mythology, Persian: ‌حسن فریدون‎, Persian pronunciation: [hæˌsæn-e feɾejˈdun]) and later changed his last name to Rouhani, which means 'spiritual' or 'cleric'; [29] also transliterated as Rowhani, Ruhani, or Rohani). It is not clear when he officially changed his last name. He was named as "Hassan Fereydoun Rouhani" (Persian: حسن فریدون روحانی‎) in a list of Majlis representatives on 5 July 1981, [30] while photos of his identification card (in Persian transliteration: shenasnameh) taken around his presidential campaign in 2013 only say "Rouhani" is his last name. [8]  Early life and education[ edit ]  Hassan Rouhani (born Hassan Fereydoun) was born on 12 November 1948 [8] in Sorkheh, near Semnan, into a religious Persian family. [31] His father, Haj Asadollah Fereydoun (died 2011), [32] had a spice shop in Sorkheh [33] and his mother lived in Semnan until her death in 2015 with her daughters and sons-in-law. [8] [34] Asadollah Fereydoun is reported to have been politically active against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, and arrested first in 1962, and then more than twenty times before the Iranian Revolution in 1979. [35]  Rouhani started religious studies in 1960, first at Semnan Seminary [9]:55 before moving on to the Qom Seminary in 1961. [9]:76 He attended classes taught by prominent scholars of that time including Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, Morteza Haeri Yazdi, Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, Soltani, Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, and Mohammad Shahabadi. [9]:81 In addition, he studied modern courses, and was admitted to the University of Tehran in 1969, and obtained a BA degree in Judicial Law in 1972. [6] [9]:309–312 In 1973, Rouhani entered military service in the city of Nishapur. [36]  Rouhani continued his studies at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, graduating in 1995 with an M.Phil. degree in Law with his thesis entitled The Islamic legislative power with reference to the Iranian experience and a PhD degree in Constitutional Law in 1999 for a thesis titled The Flexibility of Shariah (Islamic Law) with reference to the Iranian experience. [37] [38] Rouhani's Caledonian research was initially supervised by Iranian lawyer and scholar Professor Sayed Hassan Amin and later by Islamic law scholar Dr Mahdi Zahraa. [39]  The website of the Center for Strategic Research, a think-tank headed by Rouhani, misattributed his PhD to Glasgow University rather than Glasgow Caledonian University and confusion ensued as a result on whether he was a graduate of either university, especially as he was known during his student years by his birth name "Hassan Fereydoun". [40] Glasgow Caledonian University carried out an internal investigation to confirm Rouhani's alumnus status and after confirming it, it published Rouhani's theses abstracts and a video showing him being capped, as Scottish academic tradition provides, during the University's 1999 graduation ceremony. [41] [42]  Main article: Hassan Rouhani plagiarism allegations  Allegations regarding Rouhani's plagiarism were first raised in 2013 when it was claimed that he had probably "lifted" sentences from a book by Afghan author Mohammad Hashim Kamali. Glasgow Caledonian University, Rouhani's graduation school, argued that the sentences were both cited properly. The issue was raised again amid 2017 Iranian presidential election when a student campaign claimed that they had for the first time investigated Rouhani's whole thesis using plagiarism detection tool iThenticate and that chapters one through four of Rouhani's thesis had been plagiarized at least 39%, 43%, 40% and 82%, respectively. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Kalantari, a member of the Assembly of Experts, Shiraz University faculty member and one of the alleged victims, said that "major segments" of Chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis had been translated from his book without being referenced. [43]  Reformist Sadegh Zibakalam accused Rouhani's rival of politicizing the case right before the elections. Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, head of Iranian Parliament 's Commission on Education and Research, said that he had found major plagiarisms in chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis and that the case would be investigated in Education and Research Commission. [43] 50 student-run organizations [44] as well as Shiraz University faculty professors asked Ali Akbar Kalantari to prosecute the case in separate letters. [45]  As a young cleric, Hassan Rouhani started his political activities by following the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the beginning of the Iranian Islamist movement. In 1965, he began traveling throughout Iran making speeches against the government of the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (king) of Iran. During those years he was arrested many times and was banned from delivering public speeches. [9]:232  In November 1977, during a public ceremony held at Tehran's Ark Mosque to commemorate the death of Mostafa Khomeini (the elder son of the Ayatollah Khomeini), Rouhani used the title "Imam" for the Ayatollah Khomeini, the then exiled leader of the Islamist movement, for the first time. [9]:375 [31] It has been suggested that the title has been used for Khomeini by others before, including by the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, although Rouhani was influential in publicizing the title. [46] [47] [48]  Since he was under surveillance by SAVAK (Iran's pre-revolution intelligence agency), the Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti and the Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari advised him to leave the country. [9]:385  Outside Iran he made public speeches to Iranian students studying abroad and joined Khomeini upon arriving in France. [9]:410  Political career during the 1980s and 1990s[ edit ]  Early years of Islamic Republic[ edit ]  Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Rouhani, who had been engaged in revolutionary struggles for about two decades, did his best to stabilize the nascent Islamic Republic and as a first step, he started with organizing the disorderly Iranian army and military bases. [9]:515 He was elected to the Majlis, the Parliament of Iran, in 1980. During five terms in the Majlis and for a total of 20 years (from 1980 to 2000), he served in various capacities including deputy speaker of the Majlis (in 4th and 5th terms), as well as the head of defense committee (1st and 2nd terms), and foreign policy committee (4th and 5th terms). [31]  Among responsibilities shouldered by him in the post-revolution era was leadership of the supervisory council of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) from 1980 to 1983. [6] In July 1983, while Rouhani was heading the council, the council members and Rouhani had conflicts [49] with Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani the then head of IRIB, which led to temporary replacement of Hashemi by first Rouhani and then immediately Mohammad Javad Larijani. [50] The conflict was resolved by the Ayatollah Khomeini intervening and insisting on Rafsanjani staying as the head of IRIB. [51]  Iran–Iraq War[ edit ]  Main article: Iran–Iraq War  During the Iran–Iraq War, Rouhani was a member of the Supreme Defense Council (1982–1988), member of the High Council for Supporting War and headed its Executive Committee (1986–1988), deputy commander of the war (1983–1985), commander of the Khatam-ol-Anbiya Operation Center (1985–1988), and commander of the Iran Air Defense Force (1986–1991). [6] He was appointed as Deputy to Second-in-Command of Iran's Joint Chiefs of Staff (1988–1989). [6]  When Robert C. McFarlane, Reagan's national security adviser, came to Tehran in May 1986, Rouhani was one of the three people who talked to McFarlane about buying weapons. Eventually, this weapons sale became known as the Iran–Contra affair. [52] [53]  At the end of the war, Hassan Rouhani was awarded the second-grade Fath (Victory) Medal along with a group of commanders of the Iranian Army and the Revolutionary Guards. In another ceremony on the occasion of the liberation of Khoramshahr, he and a group of other officials and military commanders who were involved in the war with Iraq were awarded first-grade Nasr Medal by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Ayatollah Khamenei.  Rouhani was offered and turned down the post of Minister of Intelligence of Iran in 1989. [54]  After the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was amended and the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) came into being up to the present time, he has been representative of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, at the council. [6] Rouhani was the first secretary of the SNSC and kept the post for 16 years from 1989 to 2005. He was also national security advisor – to President Hashemi and President Khatami – for 13 years from 1989 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2005. [6] In 1991, Rouhani was appointed to the Expediency Council and has kept that post up to the present time. He heads the Political, Defense, and Security Committee of the Expediency Council. [6]  After the Iran student protests, July 1999 he, as secretary of Supreme National Security Council, stated in a pro-government rally that "At dusk yesterday we received a decisive revolutionary order to crush mercilessly and monumentally any move of these opportunist elements wherever it may occur. From today our people shall witness how in the arena our law enforcement force . . . shall deal with these opportunists and riotous elements, if they simply dare to show their faces." [55] and led the crackdown. [56]  In the midterm elections for the third term of the Assembly of Experts which was held on 18 February 2000, Rouhani was elected to the Assembly of Experts from Semnan Province. He was elected as Tehran Province 's representative to the Assembly's fourth term in 2006 and is still serving in that capacity. He was the head of the political and social committee of the assembly of experts (from 2001 to 2006), member of the presiding board, and head of Tehran office of the secretariat of the assembly (from 2006 to 2008). On 5 March 2013, he was elected as a member of the Assembly's "Commission for investigating ways of protecting and guarding Velayat-e Faqih". [57]  In addition to executive posts, Rouhani kept up his academic activities. From 1995 to 1999, he was a member of the board of trustees of Tehran Universities and North Region. Rouhani has been running the Center for Strategic Research since 1991. He is the managing editor of three academic and research quarterlies in Persian and English, which include Rahbord (Strategy), Foreign Relations, and the Iranian Review of Foreign Affairs.  Hassan Rouhani, 29 January 2005  Rouhani was secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for 16 years. His leading role in the nuclear negotiations which brought him the nickname of "Diplomat Sheikh", first given to him by the nascent Sharq newspaper in November 2003 and was frequently repeated after that by domestic and foreign Persian-speaking media. His career at the Council began under President Hashemi Rafsanjani and continued under his successor, President Khatami. Heinonen, former senior IAEA official, said that Rouhani used to boast of how he had used talks with Western powers to "buy time to advance Iran's programme." [58] His term as Iran's top nuclear negotiator, however, was limited to 678 days (from 6 October 2003 to 15 August 2005). That period began with international revelations about Iran's nuclear energy program and adoption of a strongly worded resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In June 2004, the board of governors of the IAEA issued a statement which was followed by a resolution in September of the same year, which focused on Iran's nuclear case with the goal of imposing difficult commitments on Iran. That development was concurrent with the victory of the United States in Iraq war and escalation of war rhetoric in the region. The international community was experiencing unprecedented tensions as a result of which Iran's nuclear advances were considered with high sensitivity. [15]:120–126  As tensions increased and in view of the existing differences between Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Atomic Energy Organization, a proposal was put forth by the foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, which was accepted by the president and other Iranian leaders. According to that proposal, a decision was made to establish a politically, legally, and technically efficient nuclear team with Hassan Rouhani in charge. The team was delegated with special powers in order to formulate a comprehensive plan for Iran's interactions with the IAEA and coordination among various concerned organizations inside the country. Therefore, on the order of President Khatami with the confirmation of Ali Khamenei, Hassan Rouhani took charge of Iran's nuclear case on 6 October 2003. [15]:138–140 Subsequently, negotiations between Iran and three European states started at Saadabad in Tehran and continued in later months in Brussels, Geneva and Paris.  Rouhani and his team, whose members had been introduced by Velayati and Kharazi as the best diplomats in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, [15]:109,141 based their efforts on dialogue and confidence building due to political and security conditions. As a first step, they prevented further escalation of accusations against Iran in order to prevent reporting Iran's nuclear case to the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, and for the purpose of confidence building, certain parts of Iran's nuclear activities were voluntarily suspended at several junctures.  In addition to building confidence, insisting on Iran's rights, reducing international pressures and the possibility of war, and preventing Iran's case from being reported to the UN Security Council, Iran succeeded in completing its nuclear fuel cycle and took groundbreaking steps. [15]:660–667 However, decisions made by the nuclear team under the leadership of Rouhani were criticized by certain circles in later years. [59] [60]  Following the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, Rouhani resigned his post as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council after 16 years on 15 August 2005, [15]:594,601 and was succeeded by Ali Larijani as the new secretary who also took charge of Iran's nuclear case. Larijani, likewise, could not get along with the policies of the new government and resigned his post on 20 October 2007, to be replaced by Saeed Jalili. Rouhani then was appointed by the Supreme Leader as his representative at the SNSC. [61]  See also: Hassan Rouhani presidential campaign, 2013  Rouhani during his victory speech, 15 June 2013  Our centrifuges are good to spin when our people's economy is also spinning in the right direction.  Rouhani during TV debate [62]  Rouhani was considered a leading candidate in the June election because of his centrist views yet close ties to Iran's ruling clerics and the Green Movement. [63] He announced his presidential candidacy on 11 March 2013 and registered as a presidential candidate on 7 May. Amid the run-up to the election, former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, together with reformists supported Rouhani on the presidential race after pro-reform candidate Mohammad Reza Aref dropped out of the presidential race after Khatami advised him to quit in favor of Rouhani. [64] On 10 June, Mehr news agency and Fars news agency, suggested that Rouhani might be disqualified prior to the election [65] and The Washington Post, in an editorial, predicted that Rouhani "will not be allowed to win". [66] On 15 June 2013, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar announced the results of the election, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes, while his main rival Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf secured 6,077,292 votes. [67] [68] Rouhani performed well with both the middle class and youth, even garnering majority support in religious cities such as Mashhad and Qom (an important seat of Shia Islam and the clergy, many of whom surprisingly do not support conservatives) [69] as well as small towns and villages. [21] Rouhani's electoral landslide victory was widely seen as the result of the Green Movement from the 2009 elections, with crowds chanting pro-reform slogans. Religious Iranians equally celebrated Rouhani's victory, demonstrating what analysts described as a thorough rejection of the policies of the conservative factions. [21]  2017 presidential election[ edit ]  Main article: 2017 Iranian presidential election  See also: Hassan Rouhani presidential campaign, 2017  Rouhani saw off a strong challenge from hardline Ebrahim Raisi at the 2017 election, a fellow cleric with radically different politics, who stirred up populist concerns about the sluggish economy, lambasted Rouhani for seeking foreign investment and appealed to religious conservatives. He had gathered momentum as conservatives keen to win back control of the government coalesced behind Raisi's initially lacklustre campaign. His other rivals were Mostafa Mir-Salim and Mostafa Hashemitaba.  Rouhani ultimately won the election in a landslide, providing a ringing endorsement of his efforts to re-engage with the West and offer greater freedoms. [70] He received 23,636,652 of the votes, [28] in an election that had 73.07% turnout.  Presidency (2013–present)[ edit ]  Main articles: Government of Hassan Rouhani (2013–17) and Government of Hassan Rouhani (2017–present)  In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world. He promised greater openness and to repair the country's international standing, offering greater nuclear transparency in order to restore international trust. [71] Revolutionary Guards Major General Mohammad Jafari criticised Rouhani's administration. "The military, systems and procedures governing the administrative system of the country are the same as before, [but it] has been slightly modified and unfortunately infected by Western doctrine, and a fundamental change must occur. The main threat to the revolution is in the political arena and the Guards cannot remain silent in the face of that." In May 2017, Rouhani was re-elected as President with 23.5 million votes. [72]  Hassan Rouhani taking oath of office in the Iranian Parliament with Chief Justice Sadeq Larijani at his left  He was announced the winner on the day following the election. He received his presidential precept from his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 3 August 2013 and entered Sa'dabad Palace in a private ceremony. His work as president officially began on the same day at 17:00 IRDT. He was inaugurated as the seventh president of Iran on 4 August in House of the Parliament. [73]  See also: Cabinet of Iran  Rouhani announced his cabinet on 4 August. He had a ten-day mandate for introducing his cabinet members to the parliament but he did not use this. Then, parliament voted on his cabinet, which was scheduled on 14–19 August. Between three reformist politicians (Mohammad Reza Aref, Eshaq Jahangiri or Mohammad Shariatmadari) that were likely for the vice presidency, Rouhani appointed Jahangiri for the position. There were also many candidates for the ministry of foreign affairs: Ali Akbar Salehi, Kamal Kharazi, Sadegh Kharazi, Mohammad Javad Zarif and Mahmoud Vaezi but Zarif became Rouhani's final nominee. [74] Although several names were being circulated for the other ministerial posts before the final announcement, the office of president-elect denied these speculations. On 23 July 2013, it was reported that eight members of Rouhani's cabinet had been finalized: Jahangiri as first vice president, Zarif as foreign minister, Rahmani Fazli as interior minister, Tayebnia as finance minister, Dehghan as defense minister, Namdar Zanganeh as petroleum minister, Najafi as education minister, Chitchian as energy minister, Nematzadeh as industries minister, Hassan Hashemi as health minister and Akhondi as transportation minister. [75] This become official after Rouhani presented the list of his ministry nominates to the parliament on his inauguration day. He also appointed Mohammad Nahavandian as his chief of staff.  Domestic policy[ edit ]  See also: 2017–18 Iranian protests  Economic[ edit ]  See also: Economy of Iran and Taxation in Iran  The economic policy of Hassan Rouhani focuses on the long-term economic development of Iran. It deals with increasing the purchasing power of the public, economic growth, raising sufficient funds, implementation of the general policies of 44th Principle of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran and improving the business environment in the short term. [76] Rouhani believes that improving the economic conditions of the people should be accomplished by boosting the purchasing power of the people, reducing the wealth gap. He also thinks that equitable distribution of national wealth and economic growth lead to all mentioned economic goals. He states that if national wealth was not created, poverty would be distributed. National wealth creation causes an increase in real income per capita and equitable distribution of wealth. His plan is targeted to increase direct and indirect assistance to low-income groups. [77]  Rouhani is urgently going to regenerate the Management and Planning Organization of Iran. His economic policies also comprise optimal distribution of subsidies, control of liquidity and inflation, speeding economic growth and reducing import. He believes that inflation results in damaging effects on the economy of families and hopes to deflate that in Foresight and Hope Cabinet. [78]  Rouhani plans urgent economic priorities such as control of high inflation, increasing purchasing power and cutting down high unemployment. [79]  Culture and media[ edit ]  See also: Culture of Iran and Censorship in Iran  According to a March 2014 report by Center for International Media Assistance, since Rouhani takeover in 2013, "Censorship of the Internet has only gotten worse, but it's more and more clear that Rouhani does not have complete control over this process". [80]  Regarding internet censorship, he has stated: "Gone are the days when a wall could be built around the country. Today there are no more walls." He has also criticized Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting for showing trivial foreign news, while ignoring pressing national matters. [81] Rouhani also appeared to pledge his support for increasing Internet access and other political and social freedoms. In an interview, he said: "We want the people, in their private lives, to be completely free, and in today’s world having access to information and the right of free dialogue, and the right to think freely, is the right of all peoples, including the people of Iran." [82]  Human and women's rights[ edit ]  See also: Human rights in Iran  Rouhani has maintained a policy of not publicly addressing human rights issues, on which he may have limited powers. [83]  Rouhani is a supporter of women's rights. In a speech after he was elected as the President of Iran, he said:  There must be equal opportunities for women. There is no difference between man and woman in their creation, in their humanity, in their pursuit of knowledge, in their understanding, in their intelligence, in their religious piety, in serving God and in serving people. [84]  Rouhani's government appointed Elham Aminzadeh, Shahindokht Molaverdi and Masoumeh Ebtekar as vice presidents; as well as Marzieh Afkham, the first female spokesperson for the foreign ministry. Rouhani has promised to set up a ministry for women. Many women's rights activists, however, are reluctant about a ministry for women; because they feel that this ministry may isolate women's issues. It has also been suggested that Rouhani will require a deputy minister position within each ministry to address gender issues and issues pertaining to women. [85]  In September 2013, eleven political prisoners were freed including noted human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh. The move came just days before his visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly. [86]  Critics say that little has changed in domestic policy since Rouhani took office. Iranian authorities executed 599 people during Rouhani's first 14 months in power, compared with 596 during the last year in office of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran has the highest number of executions anywhere in the world, apart from China. [87] Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has criticized Rouhani's human rights record. She cited the increase in executions, Abdolfattah Soltani 's hunger strike, and the continued house arrest of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi. An Iranian spokesperson said Ebadi's comments would end up provoking animosity towards Iran. [88] [89] [90]  In 2015, Rouhani appointed Marzieh Afkham and Saleh Adibi, as the first female since the 1979 (the second in history) and the first Sunni Kurd respectively, to hold office as ambassadors. [91] [92]  At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China, June 2018  Rouhani's foreign policy has been contained by the conservatism of Iranian Principlists, who fear change, while also realizing it is necessary. Furthermore, Iran's foreign policy, which was deadlocked by the efforts of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, needs new predecessor by cautious and decisive efforts of Rouhani. [ clarification needed ] The main task of Rouhani is only to develop dialogues between Iran and Political rivals including P5+1. This course can help lift sanctions that damaged the Iranian economy. [93]  In March 2015, Rouhani sent a letter to President Obama and the heads of the other five countries negotiating with Iran, explaining Iran's stance. He announced it on his Twitter account. The US National Security Council confirmed that the letter had been passed on to the U.S. negotiating team, but its contents were not released. Rouhani also spoke by phone with the leaders of all the nations involved in the negotiations, except for the United States. [94]  Rouhani with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 23 May 2016  Nuclear talks[ edit ]  United Kingdom[ edit ]  See also: Iran–United Kingdom relations  Rouhani met with British Prime Minister David Cameron, marking the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the leaders of Iran and the United Kingdom have met. [95] On 20 February 2014 the Iranian Embassy in London was restored and the two countries agreed to restart diplomatic relations. [96] On 23 August 2015 the embassy was officially reopened. [97]  See also: Iran–United States relations  Rouhani with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Tehran, November 2015  Rouhani's visit to New York City in September 2013 was hailed [ who? ] as major progress in Iran's relations with the United States. He previously said that his government is ready to hold talks with the United States after thirty-two years. Rouhani denied reports that during his trip he had refused a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, [98] and felt more time was needed to coordinate such a meeting. [98] On 27 September 2013, a day after the two countries foreign ministers met during the P5+1 and Iran talks, Rouhani had a phone call with President Obama that marked two countries' highest political exchange since 1979. [98] [99] [100] However, due to this phone call Rouhani was protested by conservatives who chanted " death to America" when he returned to Tehran. [98]  In February 2019, Rouhani condemned the United States for trying to topple Iran's ally, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. [101]  On 3 January 2020, the second most powerful person in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, was killed by the United States, which considerably heightened the existing tensions between the two countries. Rouhani said that Iran "will take revenge". [102]  After Joe Biden won the presidential elections against Donald Trump in November 2020, Hassan Rouhani stated that it was an opportunity for Biden’s administration to “compensate for previous mistakes”. [103]  Syria[ edit ]  See also: Iranian support for Syria in the Syrian civil war and Iran–Syria relations  Rouhani, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Russia, 22 November 2017  It is generally assumed that he will follow the ruling establishment in completely supporting Bashar al-Assad, Syria's contentious president, in the Syrian Civil War, as well as "strengthening the Shia Crescent" that runs from southern Lebanon, through Syria, Iraq and into Iran. [104] In his first press conference after winning the presidential election, Rouhani said that "the ultimate responsibility to resolve the Syrian civil war should be in the hands of the Syrian people." [105]  Iraq[ edit ]  See also: Iran–Iraq relations, Iran and ISIL, and Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)  Rouhani has termed Iran–Iraq relations"brotherly" and signed several agreements with Iraq. [106] Right after the Northern Iraq offensive, Iran was the first country to send support for Iraq [107] and is a "key player" in Military intervention against the ISIL. [108]  Ali Khamenei and Rouhani with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, 22 April 2019  Saudi Arabia[ edit ]  See also: Iran–Saudi Arabia relations  On Iran's relationship to Saudi Arabia, Rouhani wrote that during the Khatami administration, he, as the secretary-general of the National Security Council at that time, reached "a comprehensive and strategic agreement" with the Saudis, but that this agreement was not upheld during the Ahmadinejad's government. Specifically, while discussing the episode, he stated:  there was a consensus [during Khatami's administration] that we should have good relations with Saudi Arabia. No one within the nezaam [regime] was opposed to it. I went to Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1998. At that time Saudi Arabia had accused us of involvement in the Khobar Towers bombing. I went to Saudi Arabia as the secretary-general of the SNSC. From their side, [Minister of Interior] Nayef bin Abdulaziz took part in the negotiations. The negotiations began at 10 p.m. and lasted until 5 a.m. the next morning. We finally agreed on a security agreement. I returned to Saudi Arabia in [early] 2005, and had extensive discussions about the region, mutual problems between us, and the nuclear issue. We agreed with Nayef to form four committees. They were supposed to convene every few months and pursue the issues. After I left [the post of] secretary-general, none of the committees were formed and there were no meetings. [109]  — Hassan Rouhani, Sterateji-ye Amniat-e Melli Jomhouri-ye Eslami-ye Iran (National Security Strategy of the Islamic Republic of Iran)  Rouhani and Ali Khamenei with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, 11 February 2017  Rouhani has criticized Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen, saying: "Don't bomb children, elderly men and women in Yemen. Attacking the oppressed will bring disgrace." [110]  Israel[ edit ]  See also: Iran–Israel relations  Rouhani has described Israel as "an occupier and usurper government" that "does injustice to the people of the region, and has brought instability to the region, with its warmongering policies", [111] and a "cancerous tumor established by Western countries to advance their interests in the Middle East." [112]  When asked in an interview with CNN to clarify his opinion about the Holocaust, Rouhani replied: "... in general, I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity, including the crime the Nazis created towards the Jews as well as non-Jews is reprehensible and condemnable. Whatever criminality they committed against the Jews, we condemn". [113] The live translation of his statements included explicit mention of the Holocaust, leading to media reports that he had acknowledged its existence, in contrast to the persistent denial of his predecessor. [114] However, Iranian state media contradicted this, accusing CNN of deliberate mistranslation. Independent translations, including one by the Wall Street Journal, supported the position that Rouhani had not explicitly accepted the Holocaust's existence. [114] [115]  According to a poll conducted in March 2016 by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) among Iranian citizens, Rouhani has 75% approval and 12% disapproval ratings and thus a +54% net popularity, making him the second most popular politician in Iran, after Mohammad Javad Zarif with +69% net popularity. Rouhani surpasses Hassan Khomeini (+52%), Mohammad Khatami (+43%) and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (+38%) who take the following places. The firm states with 95% confidence that the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points. [117]  Job approval[ edit ]  Rouhani began his presidency in November 2013 with approval and disapproval ratings near 58% and 27% respectively, [118] according to Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) which is assessing it on a quarterly basis. It gradually fell down to 48% and he recorded a 33% disapproval rating in May 2015. [118] His job approval boosted after Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, according to the survey conducted by IranPoll for the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies (CISSM), standing on 88% with a large majority (61%) expressing a "very favorable view" of him (up from 51% in July 2014) and a ±3.2 margin of sampling error. The poll also indicated Rouhani has a "tough challenge" in maintaining the support due to the fact that people have high economic expectations from the deal, and it could become his Achilles' heel. [119] iPOS has recorded a 54% approval and 24% disapproval, days after the deal in August 2015. [118] The trend has continued until February 2016, with 67% and 18% approval and disapproval ratings, marking the highest level since he took office. [120]  Rouhani is considered to be a moderate and pragmatic politician. [21] In 2000, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy described him as "power-hungry". [123] He was elected as president with heavy reformist support, and he pledged to follow through with reformist demands and to bridge divides between reformists and conservatives.

Rouhani married his cousin, Sahebeh Erabi (Rouhani), [126] who is six years younger, when he was around 20 years old [34] [127] and has four children (one son and three daughters). [128] Rouhani's wife changed her last name from "Еrabi" (Persian: عربی‎) to "Rouhani" some time after marriage. [33] Born in 1954, she is not politically active. [126] The Guardian and the Financial Times reported that Rouhani also had a fifth child, a son who has died in unknown circumstances. [129] [130]  Rouhani has three sisters and a brother. [34] Rouhani's brother, Hossein Fereydoun, is also a diplomat and politician, a former governor, ambassador, [131] and former Vice Minister of Intelligence. [132] He was Rouhani's representative to IRIB in arrangements for presidential debates. [133] Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in a memoir dated 15 May 1982, mentions Hossein Fereydoun as the then governor of Karaj. [134] Rafsanjani later briefly mentions Fereydoon in a memoir dated 31 March 1984: "In Karaj, something has happened about Mr. Ferydoon Rouhani".

Shakshi	Donald Trump	Individual	https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/06/politics/trump-and-gop-lawsuits-to-challenge-election-flail-in-court/index.html	(CNN) The Trump campaign and President Donald Trump peppered Thursday with tweets and news conferences boasting of success in courts as states continue to count ballots, but the legal efforts repeatedly failed to gain traction or affect significant enough numbers of votes, if any, in key states.  Several of the active cases centered on Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, specifically, where vote counters throughout the day continued to tally numbers of absentee ballots that cut Trump's lead in the state dramatically.  Trump's few wins in court have largely been on procedural measures on issues that could affect minuscule numbers of ballots, or like in one Pennsylvania case, about relatively inconsequential issues such as allowing campaign canvass observers to stand slightly closer to ballot processers. In several courts in recent days, judges have been exasperated with the Trump campaign and Republicans' arguments.  In one case the Trump campaign filed in federal court on Thursday in Pennsylvania, Judge Paul Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, set a tone almost immediately with sarcasm, telling the Trump campaign lawyer, "Well, you have your hearing."  By the end of the hearing, the Trump campaign lawyer had admitted, contrary to his initial complaint, that observers for the campaign were in the room to watch ballot canvassing in Philadelphia.  The judge asked Philadelphia city officials to confirm Democrats and Republicans were being treated fairly to watch the ballot-counting and that they were allowed to watch the counting in the city from 6 feet away. He noted the case appeared to be an appeal of a state issue -- making it completely out of place for a federal court to handle.  When the Trump campaign lawyer spoke up to say he had "another problem" with the ballot observation, Diamond, the judge, cut him off, asking, "Length and width? Time and place?"  When the judge pressed the Trump campaign lawyer on if there were observers in the room from the campaign, the lawyer, Jerome Marcus, said: "There's a non-zero number of people in the room."  At another point, when Marcus handed the judge a hand-drawn map of the ballot counting room, Diamond cracked that the lawyer should keep his day job.  It wasn't the first sketch of a map introduced this week. In a Nevada Supreme Court case filed on Election Day, lawyers representing the Trump campaign similarly submitted a hand-drawn map of a ballot processing room as evidence -- an unusual approach in any case.  Election lawsuits filed on Election Day often have some air of informality, given the need for quick action. But several election law experts have been critical of the lack of serious legal arguments that representatives of the Trump campaign are making in recent days -- with some court filings not even containing evidence or assertions of fact at all.  In other states where the vote was still close, judges dismissed new Trump or Republican cases quickly on Thursday.  Georgia Judge James F. Bass on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed a day earlier by state Republicans to prevent the "unlawful counting of ballots received after the election" in Savannah, after a poll watcher for the party allegedly viewed unprocessed absentee ballots mixed in with absentee ballots that were set to be tabulated.  And in Michigan, a state court judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Trump campaign that asked for an immediate halt to the vote counting until its representatives had "meaningful" access to ballot counting and adjudication.  Judge Cynthia Stephens was highly skeptical throughout the virtual hearing about the lack of admissible evidence in the case and whether the campaign had sued the right party, the secretary of state.  "What I have is, at best, a hearsay affidavit that addresses a harm that would be significant," said Stephens. "We've got an affidavit that is not firsthand knowledge."  She said she was not convinced the campaign's claims could succeed in court.

href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and Philadelphia, specifically, where vote counters throughout the day continued to tally numbers of absentee ballots that cut Trump\'s lead in the state dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>Trump\'s few wins in court have largely been on procedural measures on issues that could affect minuscule numbers of ballots, or like in one Pennsylvania case, about relatively inconsequential issues such as allowing campaign canvass observers to stand slightly closer to ballot processers. In several courts in recent days, judges have been exasperated with the Trump campaign and Republicans\' arguments.</p>\n\n<p>In one case the Trump campaign filed in federal court on Thursday in Pennsylvania, Judge Paul Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, set a tone almost immediately with sarcasm, telling the Trump campaign lawyer, "Well, you have your hearing."</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the hearing, the Trump campaign lawyer had admitted, contrary to his initial complaint, that observers for the campaign were in the room to watch ballot canvassing in Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p>The judge asked Philadelphia city officials to confirm Democrats and Republicans were being treated fairly to watch the ballot-counting and that they were allowed to watch the counting in the city from 6 feet away. He noted the case appeared to be an appeal of a state issue -- making it completely out of place for a federal court to handle.</p>\n\n<p>When the Trump campaign lawyer spoke up to say he had "another problem" with the ballot observation, Diamond, the judge, cut him off, asking, "Length and width? Time and place?"</p>\n\n<p>When the judge pressed the Trump campaign lawyer on if there were observers in the room from the campaign, the lawyer, Jerome Marcus, said: "There\'s a non-zero number of people in the room."</p>\n\n<p>At another point, when Marcus handed the judge a hand-drawn map of the ballot counting room, Diamond cracked that the lawyer should keep his day job.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\'t the first sketch of a map introduced this week. In a Nevada Supreme Court case filed on Election Day, lawyers representing the Trump campaign similarly submitted a hand-drawn map of a ballot processing room as evidence -- an unusual approach in any case.</p>\n\n<p>Election lawsuits filed on Election Day often have some air of informality, given the need for quick action. But several election law experts<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/05/politics/trump-legal-challenges-pennsylvania-nevada-michigan/index.html">have been critical</a> of the lack of serious legal arguments that representatives of the Trump campaign are making in recent days -- with some court filings not even containing evidence or <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/1324459764957564930">assertions of fact</a> at all.</p>\n\n<p>In other states where the vote was still close, judges dismissed new Trump or Republican cases quickly on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia Judge James F. Bass on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed a day earlier by state Republicans to prevent the "unlawful counting of ballots received after the election" in Savannah, after a poll watcher for the party allegedly viewed unprocessed absentee ballots mixed in with absentee ballots that were set to be tabulated.</p>\n\n<p>And in Michigan, a state court judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Trump campaign that asked for an immediate halt to the vote counting until its representatives had "meaningful" access to ballot counting and adjudication.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Cynthia Stephens was highly skeptical throughout the virtual hearing about the lack of admissible evidence in the case and whether the campaign had sued the right party, the secretary of state.</p>\n\n<p>"What I have is, at best, a hearsay affidavit that addresses a harm that would be significant," said Stephens. "We\'ve got an affidavit that is not firsthand knowledge."</p>\n\n<p>She said she was not convinced the campaign\'s claims could succeed in court.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-11-06T08:01:37Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-11-06T05:35:49Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	USA 2020 election	Wanting		Trump and GOP lawsuits challenging election flail in court

Carel	Free Health Care Initiative	Organization	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/08/corruption-in-healthcare-in-sierra-leone-is-a-taboo-but-it-does-exist	CCTV cameras scan the triage area, as women in brightly coloured fabric line up with their children. A painting on the wall shows a lady with a baby strapped on her back under the sign “yu nor de pay no money”. At the children’s clinic where I work, healthcare is free. This is something that is not taken for granted here. In Sierra Leone, as in many parts of the world, healthcare often comes with a catch.  Corruption in healthcare is a taboo subject, with both patients and staff often reluctant to admit its existence. But it does exist. And it extends from mismanagement at high levels of government to bribes and unauthorised charges for frontline services. It is widespread and under-reported and can have devastating consequences.  Sierra Leone in west Africa was at the epicentre of the recent Ebola crisis. A 2015 Transparency International survey reported an astonishing 84% of Sierra Leoneans had paid a bribe for government services. There is huge systemic corruption, up to a third of money given to fight Ebola remains unaccounted for. An internal government audit showed £11m was missing from the first six months of the outbreak alone.  Despite having rich natural resources, the majority of the population live in grinding poverty. The country has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality in the world with 1,360 mothers dying per 100,000 live births.  It was in an effort to tackle this horrifying statistic that the president, Ernest Bai Koroma, introduced the Free Health Care Initiative in 2010, specifically granting free care for under-fives and pregnant and lactating mothers. This was a bold and much needed move for which he should be applauded. However, in spite of this campaign there are widespread reports of charges for frontline services. A 2016 report by the Campaign for Human Rights and Development International describes “rampant bribery” throughout the healthcare system in Freetown.  There are stories of women being told that their babies will not be monitored in labour unless they give money to the nurse in charge, unofficial payments being taken in order to triage or register patients and medications and medical equipment that should be free, being sold at a mark-up.  Many people are not even aware that the charges they are being asked to pay are unauthorised  Sierra Leone has an adult literacy rate of 40%. Many people are not empowered to stand up for their right to free healthcare, and are often not even aware that the charges they are being asked to pay are unauthorised. There is inevitably a fear of reporting corruption as people are afraid they may be victimised or excluded altogether next time they come.  But the government is trying to make changes to that culture. At the state run hospital in the centre of town there are now posters which proclaim “pay no bribe”, urging people to report any cases of bribery they may encounter. This new initiative organised by Sierra Leone’s Anti-Corruption Commission, and funded by the UK Department for International Development, allows people to call a toll-free number to report cases of corruption across the education, electricity, health, police, water and sanitation sectors. This innovation goes some way to putting some of the power back into the hands of the people using these services. In the last quarter of 2016, 23.2% of bribes reported on these hotlines were paid to healthcare officials.  The reasons for these difficulties in Sierra Leone are complex and multifaceted. Although the country has an acute shortage of healthcare personnel, qualified nurses are often made to work for years as “volunteers”. When they are actually paid, salaries for government nurses and doctors are shockingly low. This mix of a sick and needy population and underpaid medical staff makes tackling corruption more difficult. There is widespread corruption in government with funds misappropriated and misused – as was only too clearly illustrated during the Ebola crisis. This situation is replicated across healthcare sectors in many countries across the world.  Research shows that charges at the point of access to healthcare reduce a person’s likelihood of seeking help and the seeking of bribes must surely act in the same way no matter how small. They lead to people delaying access to healthcare or not seeking it at all. For a woman living in one of the town’s slums with a sick baby, the cost of transport to the healthcare facilities will make access almost impossible, and any charges on arrival will prohibit it all together. People being charged bribes are disempowered, if they refuse to pay they will be denied services. Government officials syphoning funds away from their intended uses are harming the vulnerable who they are there to serve.  Although corruption remains a significant problem in Sierra Leone, it is very little spoken about, so innovations like the “pay no bribe” campaign are a hugely important step. Recognising corruption and making it visible is a crucial first act. People may be reluctant to report corruption because of fears of retribution, so allowing anonymous reporting is a great innovation and a first step to empowering people, so long as it is followed up without fear or favour.  More is needed to tackle this deeply entrenched problem, better pay for nursing staff, tighter regulation of hospitals and scrutiny of healthcare budgets. The population need to be enabled to demand more effective services. Corruption in healthcare certainly comes as a result of poverty and inequality, but it only serves to drive both these things. Ultimately it is the sick children who are kept at home, and denied healthcare because of their carer’s fear of charges, who suffer.		am	Talking about healthcare corruption	Wanting		Corruption in healthcare in Sierra Leone is a taboo - but it does exist
Carel	Robert Bentley	Individual	https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2014/04/10/326063.htm	The director of the Alabama Securities Commission expects a new state law to make it easier to prosecute securities fraud cases that take years for the crime to emerge.  Gov. Robert Bentley signed legislation this week sponsored by Republican Rep. Paul DeMarco of Homewood that extends the statute of limitations for many crimes from three years to five years. They include theft of property, extortion and bribery.  Securities Commission Director Joe Borg said the new law also extends the statute of limitations for securities fraud and theft by deception to five years from when the fraud is discovered. The statute of limitations for theft by deception had been three years from when the crime occurred and securities fraud had been five years form when the deal occurred.  Borg said that during the recession, when interest rates on bank accounts dropped very law, some people, particularly senior citizens, put their money in long-term investments that didn’t offer a return until five or six years later. By then, the statute of limitations had run out if any fraud was involved.  “This is going to be a big deal for long-term investments,” he said in a phone interview Tuesday night.  The bill received final passage in the Legislature on April 3, the last day of the 2014 session. It did not get a negative vote in either the House or the Senate.  It was one of two major bills the Securities Commission got passed at the end of the session. The other, which has also been signed by the governor, allows the use of “crowd funding” through social media to raise up to $1 million to start a small business.

Carel	Transparency International	Organization	https://www.transparency.org/en/news/corruption-in-the-usa-the-difference-a-year-makes#	The US faces a wide range of domestic challenges related to the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, which is Transparency International’s definition of corruption.  Key issues include the influence of wealthy individuals over government; “pay to play” politics and the revolving doors between elected government office, for-profit companies, and professional associations; and the abuse of the US financial system by corrupt foreign kleptocrats and local elites.  The current US president was elected on a promise of cleaning up American politics and making government work better for those who feel their interests have been neglected by political elites.  Yet, rather than feeling better about progress in the fight against corruption over the past year, a clear majority of people in America now say that things have become worse. Nearly six in ten people now say that the level of corruption has risen in the past twelve months, up from around a third who said the same in January 2016.  A new survey by Transparency International, the US Corruption Barometer 2017, was carried out in October and November 2017. It shows that the US government and some key institutions of power still have a long way to go to win back citizens’ trust.  The results show:  44 per cent of Americans believe that corruption is pervasive in the White House, up from 36 per cent in 2016. Almost 7 out of 10 people believe the government is failing to fight corruption, up from half in 2016. Close to a third of African-Americans surveyed see the police as highly corrupt, compared to a fifth across the survey overall. 55 per cent gave fear of retaliation as the main reason not to report corruption, up from 31 per cent in 2016. 74 per cent said ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.

Shakshi	Kim Tok-hun	Individual	http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/leadership-biographies/kim-tok-hun/	Kim Tok Hun (Kim Tok-hun) is the DPRK Premier and a Presidium (standing committee) Member of the Workers’ Party of Korea [WPK] Political Bureau. He is also a member of the WPK Central Committee and a deputy to the Supreme People’s Assembly [SPA].  Kim began his career as a floor manager and supervisor in North Korea’s heavy industry sector. His first significant position was an assistant manager at the Taean Heavy Machinery Complex. He was appointed manager of Taean Heavy Machinery Complex in 2003 when the DPRK instituted its “complex enterprise system” in 2001. Kim was elected a deputy to the 11th SPA in 2003.  In 2008, Kim Tok Hun was removed from his factory manager’s position and did not hold any public positions, including elections to the 12th SPA in March 2009.

Carel	Braxton Baker	Individual	https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13121816/rapper-braxton-brax-baker-dead-21/	RAPPER Braxton “Brax” Baker has died at the age of 21.  Her mother, Letricia Loftin Russell, shared the sad news on Thursday, writing that her “Angel Has Ascended.”  Braxton’s cause of death has not yet been revealed.  The late artist garnered attention in 2017 on music streaming sites with her project VERSE(atility).  On Instagram, Letricia penned an emotional tribute to Brax and included a touching memorial video of her daughter from throughout the years.  She wrote along with the clip: “Our angel, Braxton Blue.B Baker has ascended.  “At the time of her ascendance she laid in sacred form. There were no scratches there were no bruises, her internal and external being was completely pure.  “It was a spiritual release. God retrieved the angel He loaned us.  “Braxton was in spiritual retreat, carefully crafting and curating her art. She has since dedicated her art to humanity and healing, composing two albums and three novels.”  Letricia continued: “Most recently she was in the process of forming her brand merging her loves for fashion, and the work of Black queer revolutionary womxn.  “Braxton knew that God was working through her, she had ‘vessel’ and ‘gifted’ permanently placed on her body.  “She knew that her brilliance and art would be shared with the world in God’s timing."  In a 2018 interview with SVGE Magazine, Brax opened up about building her brand and living a life full of creativity.  7  The Richmond, Virginia-born artist said at the time: “I have been using my creativity to build a unique brand for years.  “I’ve been directing my own shoots, directing my own videos, styling myself, writing poetry, writing articles, writing raps, choreographing dances, styling myself, and styling others like it was nothing for years.  “Now that I’ve embraced that power, I don’t think the world is ready.”  Braxton’s grieving mother concluded her post by letting family, friends and Brax’s fans know that “this is just the beginning,” as she plans to dedicate her “whole being” to sharing her daughter’s work with everyone.  She added that memorial service details are still to come.

Carel	Mastercard	Organization	https://www.practicalecommerce.com/How-to-Choose-a-Fraud-Prevention-Service-for-Ecommerce	Ecommerce merchants love the holidays. So do fraudsters. Chargeback cheats and organized criminals know you’re busy driving sales, fulfilling orders, and keeping customers happy. They hope you are not as vigilant in manually reviewing their orders.  To help reduce fraudulent purchases and chargebacks, it may be worth using a fraud prevention service.  What Is a Fraud Prevention Service?  A fraud prevention service is a company dedicated to identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions — i.e., ecommerce transactions — that will result in chargebacks and lost revenue. It helps catch organized account takeover attacks, purchases made from stolen credit cards, and the so-called “friendly fraud” chargeback cheaters, who purchase products using their own, legitimate credit card numbers but then fraudulently file a chargeback with the credit card company after receiving the goods.  A fraud prevention service is a company dedicated to identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions — i.e., ecommerce transactions — that will result in chargebacks and lost revenue.  These services analyze an extensive amount of information from many sources to make an order approval recommendation. The analysis is typically much more thorough than what your card processor offers — address and security code verifications, usually. Best of all, it can integrate into your ecommerce platform and to make those recommendations quickly.  Fraud prevention services typically charge a percentage of your transaction value or a fixed fee that ranges from $80 to $1,000 per month, typically. To determine if a fraud prevention service makes financial sense to you, calculate your total fraud and chargeback costs and then add in the lost revenue from orders that you declined. Compare that overall total to the cost of the service.  Save Money and Time?  Chargebacks hurt your profits with the double impact of lost margin from unreturned product and additional fees from the bank. Then, MasterCard and Visa can charge additional amounts if chargebacks exceed 1 percent of your transactions. Plus, you have lost opportunity costs of your time when you fight chargebacks.  Prevention is the best approach. The address verification system (AVS) and CCV security code services from your merchant account provider or payment gateway are a start. However, solely relying on your merchant account provider to flag questionable orders is not enough. (For example, MerchantVoice columnist Erica Tevis, owner of Little Things Favors, an online gift boutique, recently explained the nine checks she uses to detect fraudulent orders, in “How I detect ecommerce fraud.”)  Still the bad guys have many tricks. They can spoof their location, use mobile devices, and respond to your email inquiries. They can even answer your phone calls. It’s often complex and time consuming to manually cyber sleuth each risky order.  For many ecommerce businesses, therefore, a fraud prevention service is worth the money.  Fraud Prevention Services: Questions to Ask  Here are ten questions to ask to help you choose the right fraud prevention service for your ecommerce business.  What service plans do they offer? Vendors offer different plans to fit the level of control or involvement you want. Determine if you want to be completely hands off or if you want to define the rules. Consider vendors that can customize their rules engine to match your policies and risk tolerance.  What data is analyzed? An extensive number of data sources are available to help make a risk decision. How does the service incorporate IP geolocation, proxy detection, chargeback blacklists, social graphs, issuing-bank data, and address, phone, and email verifications? Find out what is being monitored and how frequently new data sources are added.  How is mobile data identified? Mobile sales are growing quickly. Fraud from mobile devices is on the rise as well. Sophisticated vendors can establish a buyer’s online fingerprint and determine activity patterns from of a buyer’s computer, smartphone, and other web access devices.  How are false positives reduced? Declining a good order also costs you profits and new customers. It’s easy to make a policy that declines all transactions from certain countries, for example. However, a robust fraud detection service can help capture more sales by digging deeper and validating orders that you would otherwise cancel.  Do you have to approve or decline an order? Even with advanced fraud detection monitoring and analysis, the service provider may just make a recommendation or score the order. You may still have to make the final decision to accept or decline an order. Ask if they have any triggers or rules that can then be used to automatically cancel any bad orders and process all good orders.  Is it integrated with your shopping cart? You will want order data to pass seamlessly from your shopping cart into the fraud prevention systems. Ask the vendor what ecommerce platforms it works with. Most vendors support the most popular platforms. Then find out what you need to do to grant access permissions and if there is plugin installation or other coding required.  Are other order channels supported? Are there other credit-card-not-present transactions that you need to process, such as phone orders? Find out how the service supports all of your channels. What does it take to submit order data into the fraud analysis systems for offline channels? And if you also have a brick and mortar store, some vendors can augment your in-store fraud services.  What guarantees are offered? Some providers offer chargeback guarantees or insurance — i.e., if they approve a transaction that turns out bad, you are covered for some or all of your financial loses. However, if you are still making the final approval decision, it is likely that you may not qualify for compensation. So check the legal terms closely on any guarantees.  Dedicated support is available? Having a dedicated contact or, better yet, a direct fraud support team can be a big benefit to you. Vendors can improve their performance if they know more about your business. For example, the vendor can improve its fraud rules based on the products you sell, typical order values or quantities, or if you are targeting a new market. Plus, it is helpful to have someone to quickly call to discuss a questionable order.  What service level agreements are included? Speed is key when making decisions about orders, even risky ones. You don’t want to sit on an order for too long. Understand a vendor’s commitment to quick communications and alerts, system up-time, performance during high volume times, and direct contact support.

Carel	Westpac	Organization	https://theconversation.com/lack-of-real-action-on-remittances-increases-terrorist-financing-risk-34706	Globally migrant communities will send nearly US$435 billion to family members in home countries this year. These remittances are vital and sustain not only the livelihoods of the recipients, but also the economies of poor countries.  Recently Westpac, mirroring 2013 steps by Barclays in the UK, became the last big Australian bank to terminate its services to small remitters. This poses a serious risk to the continued, transparent flow of remittances.  Not all Westpac remitter accounts were closed as a group of remitters brought a [legal case](https://www.comcourts.gov.au/file/FEDERAL/P/NSD1222/2014/order_list#;javascript:void(0) against Westpac. This case as well as discussions between the newly organised Australian remittance industry, the banks and the Australian government continue. The lack of real and urgent action however threatens to increase terrorist financing risks.  Moving money – above or below board  Informal, ethnic remittance services – for example, in the form of hawala – are well-developed and often said to pre-date Western banking. These systems shift value across borders without moving physical money. The flow happens through a network of trusted agents, often involving cross-border trade and over and under-invoicing.  Informal remittance systems transfer funds cheaply and efficiently for honest customers. However, the lack of transparency and industry practices also expose them to abuse. Informal remittances are ideal for money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing.  Alongside informal services, formal providers channel money through the banking system. Formal remittance transactions are generally handled by large international companies like Western Union and Moneygram and a host of small service providers. These providers - generally small businesses with ties to ethnic communities - provide affordable and accessible services to ethnic migrant communities. To remit money through the formal financial system, remitters require bank accounts.  From 2001 governments decided to formalise these services and terminate informal remittances. Yet full regulation of remittance services was deemed challenging. Governments settled for basic registration of providers who were required to implement anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) measures.  The AML/CTF compliance burden soon proved too onerous for small remitters, while the registration processes were inadequate to weed out criminal elements and ensure the integrity of registered remitters.  Simultaneously the duty of banks to monitor their customers to prevent criminal transactions was increased, especially in relation to higher-risk customers. Regulators identified remittance businesses as higher-risk customers, thereby requiring banks to spend more money on monitoring their accounts than those of less risky customers. It soon became clear the costs of maintaining these accounts exceeded the income they could generate.  Further pressure was placed on remittance relationships when regulators began to impose superfines on banks for AML/CFT failures. Large international banks began to refuse to deal with smaller banks that could not prove they were adequately managing remittance risks. Targeted law-enforcement action against remitters provided evidence of serious criminal infiltration and collusion by some providers.  For many banks it just made compliance and business sense to exit the small remitter market, thereby undermining the formalisation policy objective.  What now?  Remitter account closures are occurring worldwide and regulators appear unable to prevent it. The most promising development to date was the establishment of a joint government and industry task group in the UK (the Action Group on Cross Border Remittances) to develop, among others, a safe UK-Somalia remittance corridor.  In general, however, regulators have merely called on banks not to engage in wholesale account closure, without taking any steps to change the rules that have led to this response. Given that money service business account closures started in the mid-2000s in the US, the lack of action is disappointing. Regulators have had 10 years to intervene. . The reality is that remittance flows will not stop. Immigrants who need to support vulnerable and often desperate family members abroad will continue to do so. They have no option.  If they cannot afford the more expensive services of the larger, formal providers, they will use informal channels or one of the myriad new online channels. Greater use of these channels will increase terrorist financing risks to society. In addition, the frustration and alienation experienced by members of such communities in Australia and abroad may translate into higher terror risks.  There are therefore compelling reasons to turn this situation around. What can be done?  1) Develop a holistic policy  The remittance debacle constitutes clear policy failure. Initial policy interventions were driven by security concerns. The sense of urgency in 2001 did not allow for sufficient fact-gathering and consultation. A holistic policy that aligns the national security, regulatory and international development goals of government is required.  Cross-border cooperation is also required. Money remitted from Australia is received elsewhere. When the recipient is in Somalia or another developing country where secure identification is not available, Australia will need to cooperate with foreign governments to limit criminal risks.  2) Regulate remittance services appropriately  The amount of money involved and the social impact of remittances demand appropriate regulation, including consumer protection. Governments recognised the need for regulation but were not prepared to do what it takes. They therefore restricted the regulatory focus to AML/CTF aspects only and burdened banks with an uncommercial, quasi-regulatory monitoring function.  This approach has clearly failed. The industry requires a regulator with a broad mandate, one that reflects and balances the interests of the broader industry, providers, customers and society. Industry self-regulation could assist in nurturing the industry but government must shoulder the weight of the regulatory responsibility.  3) Cap transactions by small remitters  The regulatory and supervisory frameworks can be proportionate if a risk-based approach is adopted. The most challenging entities to regulate are the small, independent remitters. One light-touch option is to provide a special minimal compliance regime enabling them to process a limited number of small remittance transactions.  For example, one could impose limits on individual transactions, with a total cap on the value of their monthly remittance business. Such caps are used successfully to reduce the risks posed by mobile money in developing countries. Correctly calibrated caps would align the risk of abuse with the compliance capacity of the business, while facilitating affordable remittance flows.  These are longer-term solutions. In the short term – counted in days and weeks – we need government action to secure banks that are still willing to engage these remitters. It’s up to government to devise a scheme that can keep small remittances flowing – and terrorist financing risks contained – until a more appropriate framework is developed. Having created the regulatory conditions for account closures, it is insufficient to merely call on banks not to close these accounts.

Carel	Revenue Canada	Organization	https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/this-is-fraud-prevention-month-heres-what-cisos-can-do/381461	In the last three months the RCMP has warned Canadians about telephone scams allegedly involving Revenue Canada and the Immigration departments demanding money from residents.  There are also ongoing ransomware stings (which cost victims $3.1 million last year) and attempts to trick business executives into wiring money to fraudsters (which cost victims just over $3 million last year).  In fact in 2015 authorities across the country received over 18,000 extortion-related complaints which cost 1,113 people over $3 million.  According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre the biggest dollar loss was suffered by 990 people who fell victim to what are called romance scams –usually Internet dating — and lost over $16 million. That was followed by 268 victims of investment fraud ($8 million lost), extortion scams ($3.1 million), prizes ($7.1 million) and spear phishing ($6 million lost). Just over 5,700 residents fell for what the centre calls service scams, which include phoney online warnings and phone calls that a computer has been infected ($2.8 million lost).  Which is why this is a good time to remind CISOs that March is Fraud Prevention Month in Canada. And while it’s largely an annual consumer awareness project, enterprises of all size shouldn’t forget they also have a role in being vigilant.  As part of the campaign KMPG Canada has released a guide to threat-related trends. “These key trends are what we’re seeing in the Canadian market that organizations need to be aware of to protect themselves against cyber threats, including fraud-related threats,” Kevvie Fowler, the consulting company’s national cyber response leader, said in an interview. They include:  — Extortion-driven attacks and ransomware attempts will increase.  WHAT TO DO: First, know where valuable data is stored, Fowler said, then ensure IT has a safe data backup and recovery strategy that is tested. Second, limit access to sensitive data to privileged accounts.  Ransomware often spreads by email with malicious attachments, after which the attacker encrypts systems and then demands money to unlock the data, so keep up regular employee security awareness campaigns.  Fowler also notes there’s a new ransomware strategy: A phone or email before an attack threatening to break into a corporate system unless money is paid in advance.  –Organizations will face increasing pressure from govenrments, privacy commissioners, courts and consumers to be more transparent about their cyber security readiness and breach notification.  CISOs and privacy officers are still waiting for the federal government to put forward suggested regulations for the new Digital Privacy Act, passed last year, which will detail their obligations to notify customers and partners about breaches that pose a risk of significant harm.  WHAT DO TO: KPMG says organizations have to say on top of this ever-changing environment. Rules may vary not only from province to province, but also — for those operating internationally — by country.  — The continually increasing number of mobile and IoT devices means increasing risk. The number of mobile-related vulnerabilities continues to increase, and the lack of generally-accepted security standards for IoT devices doesn’t help.  WHAT TO DO: Organizations that write their own software have to ensure developers follow good application security procedures to protect data and define who can use it, said Fowler.  At the other end enterprises have to restrict user access or warn employees of free mobile software — from flashlights to games — that often leak data or contains malware. Employees also have to be reminded to check the reputation of the software publisher before downloading any mobile apps.  –Organizations will make greater use of real-time threat intelligence tools.  Improving threat detection is replacing prevention as a basic strategy. Adding behavioral analytics is increasingly important. But threat intelligence — either created internally or subscribed to — is also becoming part of a CISO’s strategies to keep ahead of attacks.  WHAT TO DO: It’s important for CISOs to identify what they want to get out of public or commercial threat intelligence before subscribing to a feed, Fowler said.  “Understand what sensitive information you have, understand the security program you currently have in place, identify the areas where additional intelligence would be able to allow you to do a better job identifying, mitigating and responding to threats.”  –In addition to securing their enterprise CISOs will increasingly look at the risks posed by partners and suppliers — including cloud services.  Most readers already know that the 2014 breach of Target stores in the U.S. was accomplished by hacking a heating and ventilation supplier. Outside suppliers that link to enterprises are a known vulnerability that attackers will try to exploit.  WHAT TO DO: A full security audit which may include penetration testing or remote process monitoring can expose these gaps, says KPMG.  As part of Fraud Prevention Month there are a number of events. The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses is running an online Webinar today and Thursday on preventing fraud in small businesses starting at 1 p.m. Eastern. There’s a French version available on Wednesday.  Also today the Competition Bureau is hosting a Twitter chat as part of the annual ‘Too Good to Be True’ Day to help Canadians understand how to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. The chat runs from noon to 1 p.m. Eastern with the hashtag #2G2BT.  The Financial Services Commission of Ontario is running a Twitterchat Wednesday from 1 to 2 pm Eastern to help residents recognize fraud. The hashtag is #Fraudchat. It will be repeated March 31.  The Better Business Bureau has declared March 15 password reset day to remind people to regularly change all their passwords for basic security. (And if you have trouble remembering all your passwords, use a password manager.)

Shakshi	Fayez al-Sarraj	Individual	https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/17/middleeast/fayez-al-sarraj-libya-quit-intl/index.html	(CNN) The United Nations welcomes the decision by Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister to step down by the end of October, a UN statement released Thursday said.  The Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj, announced his decision in a televised speech on Wednesday.  "I declare my sincere desire to hand over my duties to the next executive authority no later than the end of October," al-Sarraj said, citing "internal and external conspiracies" and other obstacles to the effectiveness of his government.  Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General Stephanie Williams commended the decision in a statement, saying it "comes at a decisive turning point in Libya's longstanding crisis when it is clear that the situation is no longer sustainable."  "The onus is now on concerned Libyan parties to fully shoulder their responsibilities before the Libyan people, to take historic decisions, and to accept mutual concessions for the sake of their country," Williams said.  The GNA has often been at odds with General Khalifa Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and his administration, in the oil rich region in eastern Libya. The warlord has spearheaded a campaign to win control over the oil-rich North African country from the UN-backed GNA.  Despite UN-led efforts to secure a peace deal between the two factions -- as well as an ongoing UN arms embargo on Libya -- both the LNA and the Tripoli-based GNA have received military and financial support from international actors.  According to military intelligence released by the United States Africa Command, the LNA has received military support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, including on-the-ground support from private Russian military contractors.  Meanwhile, the GNA's counteroffensive against Haftar's attempt to take control of Tripoli has been supported by Turkey, who have provided GNA forces with both military hardware and assurances of on-the-ground support following the signing of a bilateral security deal in November 2019.  The Trump White House had taken an active interest in the ongoing conflict in 2019, reaching out to Haftar. But in recent months, the President's stance has changed, with Trump telling those leaders that he'd rather not get involved.

Shakshi	Syrian Army	Individual	https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/reliable-no-more-the-current-state-of-the-syrian-armed-forces/	Throughout the past nine years of conflict, the Syrian military has been instrumental in ensuring the survival of the Bashar al-Assad regime—not because of its performance on the battlefield, but rather due to its consistent loyalty. Unlike other state militaries that faced regime challenges by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, the Syrian armed forces maintained institutional loyalty. Since the Assad family took power in the 1970s, the military underwent a structural transformation that, through control mechanisms and the Alawite minority’s hegemonic position, ensured force loyalty and upheld the military’s central role in the durability of Syria’s authoritarian regime.  However, the current conflict has truly impacted the configuration of the Assad regime as well as the structure and orientation of its military institution, putting the latter’s loyalty in question. Today’s Syrian armed forces are fragmented, decision-making is contested and increasingly decentralized, and the circle of loyalty has widened in an unprecedented manner. Furthermore, a multiplication of security actors and entrenched foreign involvement have only complicated the Syrian security and defense sector’s precarious condition, rendering civil-military relations less predictable and more vulnerable to regime challenges.  The pre-2011 Syrian military  Before discussing the changes, one ought to understand the Assad regime’s pre-2011 military force. When Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970, Syria’s civil-military relations were already at an acute degree of imbalance, where the military had a strong political orientation and a magnitude of authority. When building his regime, Assad was able to end the military’s notorious business in instigating regime change via coup d’états. But he did so not by ending its political role, but by institutionalizing it so that it formed the backbone of the regime’s power structure. Thus, the armed forces underwent a drastic transformation under Hafez, changing its character from a historically regime-challenging force into a pillar of regime security. The military’s role germinated to support Assad’s Baathist rule and secure his family’s tight control over the state’s power structures.  To rearrange the military to befit his regime’s objectives, Hafez significantly expanded its size. The total number of active armed personnel grew by around 162 percent in the first ten years of his rule and by around 264 percent upon his death in 2000, according to estimates compiled by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. Assad also infused a parallel chain of command and imposed overlapping mandates and institutional redundancy on key military formations. In this way, the various organs of the regime’s coercive apparatus were designed with several layers of allegiance to compete and conjoin for regime survival.  Additionally, and arguably most importantly, Assad took advantage of the deeply divided condition of Syrian society. He elevated the number and role of the Alawites—the minority community to which the Assad family’s social and religious roots belong. Hafez—and later Bashar al-Assad—recognized the impact ethnic inclusion in the military could have on the loyalty among its ranks. As a result, the Alawite were disproportionately represented in the armed forces and the wider security sector. While this posed a legitimacy problem with regards to the public’s perception of the military’s national defense character, it also produced an institutionalized cycle of fear and distrust in Syrian society that not only provided the Assad regime with a loyal and hegemonized group in the military, but also made the Alawites dependent on the regime in a hostile and deeply divided country. As the Assad regime consolidated power, the military’s chief mission became clear: securing regime continuity above all national defense and security considerations.  Today’s Syrian military: Fragmentation and foreign penetration  Prior to 2011, the Assad regime faced formidable domestic challenges—such as the Muslim Brotherhood rebellion in Hama in 1982 and Rifat Assad’s failed coup attempt in 1984—in which the military played a central role in repelling. However, none were like the ongoing challenge that started in 2011, which, forced Bashar to rearrange and surrender some sovereignty over key power structures to maintain regime survival. While the structures that Hafez designed proved useful in standing against widespread public dissatisfaction in the first few years of the conflict, the increased capability of major rebel formations and the consequent battlefield ineffectiveness of Assad’s military prompted the inadvertent expansion of local security forces and import of foreign actors, such as Russia and Iran. Today, this has proven to be a tumorous growth in the Syrian military institution, causing loyalty dilemmas, diversification in funding sources, regional and ideological segmentation, parallel decision-making processes, and dependence on foreign patrons.  To adapt to evolving conflict dynamics, a kaleidoscope of unregulated militias and paramilitary forces with various funding sources and scopes of involvement emerged —particularly after 2013 with Legislative Decree 55 —to supplement the Syrian army. While some militias, such as the Local Defense Forces, were institutionalized in the regular army as an auxiliary force, many pro-regime militias remain in a grey legal and operational area contingent on what the post-war structure will look like. Some militias reportedly receive funding from shady pro-regime businessmen, while others are funded exclusively by foreign actors, such as Iran and Russia. As some of these militias took domestic security roles, their recruitment patterns became segmented along regional, religious, and ideological lines, which can indicate growing localized autonomies and a widened circle of loyalty, as well as security and defense incoherence.  This hybrid structure of the Syrian security sector forced de-centralization on military decision-making in a system that had long been ultra-centralized. Armed pro-regime militias have influence to affect key defense decisions, including resource distribution, mobilization, and deployment. Clashes among these militias have been reported throughout the Syrian conflict and across different frontlines. Moreover, the state-militia relationship is precarious, where militias have a patronage relationship with competing organs of the military-intelligence community. In light of engrained corruption and transactional interests, this can lead to conflicts within the military institution.  On the other hand, Russia and Iran have invested high stakes in the Syrian army and the wider security sector and currently exercise considerable influence over the military. While Moscow and Tehran improved the Syrian army’s battlefield effectiveness and reversed its territorial losses, such victory came at a high price as the Assad regime’s sole monopoly over the military decreased. Both foreign powers are increasingly involved in even the appointment of senior officers, unit commanders, and the leadership of intelligence commands. They also worked—sometimes competitively—towards institutionalizing and integrating the many militias into the Syrian army’s command structure. Decision-making with regards to operational strategies is almost completely controlled by Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran; Syrian army units associated with either foreign power increasingly take part in battles planned and conducted by their foreign ally’s troops or advisors. As a result, it can be assumed that Moscow also has influence over the allocation of resources within the military and can award loyal units and officers.  The other key aspect of the Syrian military is the presence and loyalty of the Alawites. While the Alawites’ hegemonic occupancy of the army heightened after 2011 due to Sunni defections, the community’s relationship with the military institution—and the regime by extension—changed. Their military support of the Assad regime came at an immense cost; they disproportionally lost much of their youth on the battlefield while their community continues to be hurt by the growing deterioration of living conditions. As the Alawites sacrifice for a regime that is unable to provide them with basic necessitates, their circle of loyalty is widening to include emerging notables who are substituting risky military service with safer militia membership and state services with local charities.  Perhaps the recent crackdown on businessman and regime financier Rami Makhlouf— seizing his assets, disbanding militias he financed, and shutting down his charity—can attest to his growing influence among the Alawites and the increasing vulnerability Assad is feeling with regards to his community’s support. However, the Alawites remain entrapped in the cycle of fear that the Assad regime created, which has isolated the minority community from the rest of Syrian society. This has made Assad—for the time being at least—a necessity for the community’s survival.  While the Syrian military played a key role in securing the Assad regime’s survival, the structures that were once designed to keep its forces loyal have gradually shattered in the past nine years. Although the forced de-centralization, multiplication of security actors, and foreign involvement saved the Syrian regime from military defeat, Assad measures the quality of his forces by their consistent loyalty and willingness to use force for his regime’s defense, not by their performance on the battlefield.

Unlike other state militaries that faced regime challenges by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, the Syrian armed forces maintained institutional loyalty. Since the Assad family took power in the 1970s, the military underwent a structural transformation that, through control mechanisms and the Alawite minority’s hegemonic position, ensured force loyalty and upheld the military’s central role in the durability of Syria’s authoritarian regime.\n\nHowever, the current conflict has truly impacted the configuration of the Assad regime as well as the structure and orientation of its military institution, putting the latter’s loyalty in question. Today’s Syrian armed forces are fragmented, decision-making is contested and increasingly decentralized, and the circle of loyalty has widened in an unprecedented manner. Furthermore, a multiplication of security actors and entrenched foreign involvement have only complicated the Syrian security and defense sector’s precarious condition, rendering civil-military relations less predictable and more vulnerable to regime challenges.\n\nThe pre-2011 Syrian military\n\nBefore discussing the changes, one ought to understand the Assad regime’s pre-2011 military force. When Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970, Syria’s civil-military relations were already at an acute degree of imbalance, where the military had a strong political orientation and a magnitude of authority. When building his regime, Assad was able to end the military’s notorious business in instigating regime change via coup d’états. But he did so not by ending its political role, but by institutionalizing it so that it formed the backbone of the regime’s power structure. Thus, the armed forces underwent a drastic transformation under Hafez, changing its character from a historically regime-challenging force into a pillar of regime security. The military’s role germinated to support Assad’s Baathist rule and secure his family’s tight control over the state’s power structures.\n\nTo rearrange the military to befit his regime’s objectives, Hafez significantly expanded its size. The total number of active armed personnel grew by around 162 percent in the first ten years of his rule and by around 264 percent upon his death in 2000, according to estimates compiled by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. Assad also infused a parallel chain of command and imposed overlapping mandates and institutional redundancy on key military formations. In this way, the various organs of the regime’s coercive apparatus were designed with several layers of allegiance to compete and conjoin for regime survival.\n\nAdditionally, and arguably most importantly, Assad took advantage of the deeply divided condition of Syrian society. He elevated the number and role of the Alawites—the minority community to which the Assad family’s social and religious roots belong. Hafez—and later Bashar al-Assad—recognized the impact ethnic inclusion in the military could have on the loyalty among its ranks. As a result, the Alawite were disproportionately represented in the armed forces and the wider security sector. While this posed a legitimacy problem with regards to the public’s perception of the military’s national defense character, it also produced an institutionalized cycle of fear and distrust in Syrian society that not only provided the Assad regime with a loyal and hegemonized group in the military, but also made the Alawites dependent on the regime in a hostile and deeply divided country. As the Assad regime consolidated power, the military’s chief mission became clear: securing regime continuity above all national defense and security considerations.\n\nToday’s Syrian military: Fragmentation and foreign penetration\n\nPrior to 2011, the Assad regime faced formidable domestic challenges—such as the Muslim Brotherhood rebellion in Hama in 1982 and Rifat Assad’s failed coup attempt in 1984—in which the military played a central role in repelling. However, none were like the ongoing challenge that started in 2011, which, forced Bashar to rearrange and surrender some sovereignty over key power structures to maintain regime survival. While the structures that Hafez designed proved useful in standing against widespread public dissatisfaction in the first few years of the conflict, the increased capability of major rebel formations and the consequent battlefield ineffectiveness of Assad’s military prompted the inadvertent expansion of local security forces and import of foreign actors, such as Russia and Iran. Today, this has proven to be a tumorous growth in the Syrian military institution, causing loyalty dilemmas, diversification in funding sources, regional and ideological segmentation, parallel decision-making processes, and dependence on foreign patrons.\n\nTo adapt to evolving conflict dynamics, a kaleidoscope of unregulated militias and paramilitary forces with various funding sources and scopes of involvement emerged —particularly after 2013 with Legislative Decree 55 —to supplement the Syrian army. While some militias, such as the Local Defense Forces, were institutionalized in the regular army as an auxiliary force, many pro-regime militias remain in a grey legal and operational area contingent on what the post-war structure will look like. Some militias reportedly receive funding from shady pro-regime businessmen, while others are funded exclusively by foreign actors, such as Iran and Russia. As some of these militias took domestic security roles, their recruitment patterns became segmented along regional, religious, and ideological lines, which can indicate growing localized autonomies and a widened circle of loyalty, as well as security and defense incoherence.\n\nThis hybrid structure of the Syrian security sector forced de-centralization on military decision-making in a system that had long been ultra-centralized. Armed pro-regime militias have influence to affect key defense decisions, including resource distribution, mobilization, and deployment. Clashes among these militias have been reported throughout the Syrian conflict and across different frontlines. Moreover, the state-militia relationship is precarious, where militias have a patronage relationship with competing organs of the military-intelligence community. In light of engrained corruption and transactional interests, this can lead to conflicts within the military institution.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia and Iran have invested high stakes in the Syrian army and the wider security sector and currently exercise considerable influence over the military. While Moscow and Tehran improved the Syrian army’s battlefield effectiveness and reversed its territorial losses, such victory came at a high price as the Assad regime’s sole monopoly over the military decreased. Both foreign powers are increasingly involved in even the appointment of senior officers, unit commanders, and the leadership of intelligence commands. They also worked—sometimes competitively—towards institutionalizing and integrating the many militias into the Syrian army’s command structure. Decision-making with regards to operational strategies is almost completely controlled by Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran; Syrian army units associated with either foreign power increasingly take part in battles planned and conducted by their foreign ally’s troops or advisors. As a result, it can be assumed that Moscow also has influence over the allocation of resources within the military and can award loyal units and officers.\n\nThe other key aspect of the Syrian military is the presence and loyalty of the Alawites. While the Alawites’ hegemonic occupancy of the army heightened after 2011 due to Sunni defections, the community’s relationship with the military institution—and the regime by extension—changed. Their military support of the Assad regime came at an immense cost; they disproportionally lost much of their youth on the battlefield while their community continues to be hurt by the growing deterioration of living conditions. As the Alawites sacrifice for a regime that is unable to provide them with basic necessitates, their circle of loyalty is widening to include emerging notables who are substituting risky military service with safer militia membership and state services with local charities.\n\nPerhaps the recent crackdown on businessman and regime financier Rami Makhlouf— seizing his assets, disbanding militias he financed, and shutting down his charity—can attest to his growing influence among the Alawites and the increasing vulnerability Assad is feeling with regards to his community’s support. However, the Alawites remain entrapped in the cycle of fear that the Assad regime created, which has isolated the minority community from the rest of Syrian society. This has made Assad—for the time being at least—a necessity for the community’s survival.\n\nWhile the Syrian military played a key role in securing the Assad regime’s survival, the structures that were once designed to keep its forces loyal have gradually shattered in the past nine years. Although the forced de-centralization, multiplication of security actors, and foreign involvement saved the Syrian regime from military defeat, Assad measures the quality of his forces by their consistent loyalty and willingness to use force for his regime’s defense, not by their performance on the battlefield.

Unlike other state militaries that faced regime challenges by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, the Syrian armed forces maintained institutional loyalty. Since the Assad family took power in the 1970s, the military underwent a structural transformation that, through control mechanisms and the Alawite minority’s hegemonic position, ensured force loyalty and upheld the military’s central role in the durability of Syria’s authoritarian regime.</p>\n\n<p>However, the current conflict has truly impacted the configuration of the Assad regime as well as the structure and orientation of its military institution, putting the latter’s loyalty in question. Today’s Syrian armed forces are fragmented, decision-making is contested and increasingly decentralized, and the circle of loyalty has widened in an unprecedented manner. Furthermore, a multiplication of security actors and entrenched foreign involvement have only complicated the Syrian security and defense sector’s precarious condition, rendering civil-military relations less predictable and more vulnerable to regime challenges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The pre-2011 Syrian military</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before discussing the changes, one ought to understand the Assad regime’s pre-2011 military force. When Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970, Syria’s civil-military relations were already at an acute degree of imbalance, where the military had a strong political orientation and a magnitude of authority. When building his regime, Assad was able to end the military’s notorious business in instigating regime change via coup d’états. But he did so not by ending its political role, but by institutionalizing it so that it formed the backbone of the regime’s power structure. Thus, the armed forces underwent a drastic transformation under Hafez, changing its character from a historically regime-challenging force into a pillar of regime security. The military’s role germinated to support Assad’s Baathist rule and secure his family’s tight control over the state’s power structures.</p>\n\n<p>To rearrange the military to befit his regime’s objectives, Hafez significantly expanded its size. <a>The total number of active armed personnel grew by around 162 percent in the first ten years of his rule and by around 264 percent upon his death in 2000, according to estimates </a><a href="https://www.iiss.org/publications/the-military-balance/archive">compiled</a> by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. Assad also infused a parallel chain of command and imposed overlapping mandates and institutional redundancy on key military formations. In this way, the various organs of the regime’s coercive apparatus were designed with several layers of allegiance to compete and conjoin for regime survival.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, and arguably most importantly, Assad took advantage of the deeply divided condition of Syrian society. He elevated the number and role of the Alawites—the minority community to which the Assad family’s social and religious roots belong. Hafez—and later Bashar al-Assad—recognized the impact ethnic inclusion in the military could have on the loyalty among its ranks. As a result, the Alawite were disproportionately represented in the armed forces and the wider security sector. While this posed a legitimacy problem with regards to the public’s perception of the military’s national defense character, it also produced an institutionalized cycle of fear and distrust in Syrian society that not only provided the Assad regime with a loyal and hegemonized group in the military, but also made the Alawites dependent on the regime in a hostile and deeply divided country. As the Assad regime consolidated power, the military’s chief mission became clear: securing regime continuity above all national defense and security considerations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Today’s Syrian military: Fragmentation and foreign penetration</strong></p>\n\n<p>Prior to 2011, the Assad regime faced formidable domestic challenges—such as the Muslim Brotherhood <a href="https://books.google.se/books/about/Ashes_of_Hama.html?id=99pMAgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">rebellion</a> in Hama in 1982 and Rifat Assad’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/12/world/assad-s-brother-exiled-forever-syrian-declares.html">failed</a> coup attempt in 1984—in which the military played a central role in repelling. However, none were like the ongoing challenge that started in 2011, which, forced Bashar to rearrange and surrender some sovereignty over key power structures to maintain regime survival. While the structures that Hafez designed proved useful in standing against widespread public dissatisfaction in the first few years of the conflict, the increased capability of major rebel formations and the consequent battlefield ineffectiveness of Assad’s military prompted the inadvertent expansion of local security forces and import of foreign actors, such as Russia and Iran. Today, this has proven to be a tumorous growth in the Syrian military institution, causing loyalty dilemmas, diversification in funding sources, regional and ideological segmentation, parallel decision-making processes, and dependence on foreign patrons.</p>\n\n<p>To adapt to evolving conflict dynamics, a kaleidoscope of unregulated militias and paramilitary forces with various funding sources and scopes of involvement <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/the-last-king-of-syria-the-feudalization-of-assads-rule/">emerged</a>—particularly after 2013 with <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sy/arabic/index.php?node=201&amp;nid=4253&amp;ref=tree&amp;">Legislative Decree 55</a>—to supplement the Syrian army. While some militias, such as the <a href="http://www.aymennjawad.org/18859/the-local-defence-forces-regime-auxiliary-forces">Local Defense Forces</a>, were <a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2018/12/12/reintegrating-syrian-militias-mechanisms-actors-and-shortfalls-pub-77932">institutionalized</a> in the regular army as an auxiliary force, many pro-regime <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/11/30/assad-regime-militias-and-shiite-jihadis-in-the-syrian-civil-war/">militias</a> remain in a grey legal and operational area contingent on what the post-war structure will look like. Some militias reportedly receive funding from <a href="http://raseef22.com/politics/2014/02/28/%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%8C-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84/">shady</a> pro-regime <a href="https://ctc.usma.edu/the-non-state-militant-landscape-in-syria/">businessmen</a>, while others are <a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/59215">funded</a> exclusively by foreign actors, such as Iran and Russia. As some of these militias took domestic security roles, their recruitment patterns became segmented along regional, religious, and ideological lines, which can indicate growing localized <a href="https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/PB_Autonomy_Syrian_militias_NG.pdf">autonomies</a> and a widened circle of loyalty, as well as security and defense incoherence.</p>\n\n<p>This hybrid <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2018-10-10-syrias-transactional-state-khatib-sinjab.pdf">structure</a> of the Syrian security sector forced de-centralization on military decision-making in a system that had long been ultra-centralized.

Moreover, the state-militia relationship is precarious, where militias have a patronage relationship with competing organs of the military-intelligence community. In light of engrained corruption and transactional interests, this can lead to conflicts within the military institution.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Russia and Iran have invested high stakes in the Syrian army and the wider security sector and currently <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Russia_and_Iran_in_Syria_a_Random_Partnership_or_an_Enduring_Alliance.pdf">exercise</a> considerable influence over the military. While Moscow and Tehran improved the Syrian army’s battlefield effectiveness and reversed its territorial losses, such victory came at a high price as the Assad regime’s sole monopoly over the military decreased. Both foreign powers are increasingly <a href="https://edam.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAN_Tiger-Forces-Russia-Syria-report.pdf">involved</a> in even the appointment of senior officers, unit commanders, and the leadership of intelligence commands. They also worked—sometimes competitively—towards institutionalizing and <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/analysis-the-fifth-corps-and-the-state-of-the-syrian-army/">integrating</a> the many militias into the Syrian army’s command structure. Decision-making with regards to operational strategies is almost completely controlled by Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran; Syrian army units <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/lion-and-eagle-syrian-arab-armys-destruction-and-rebirth">associated</a> with either foreign power increasingly take part in battles planned and conducted by their foreign ally’s troops or advisors. As a result, it can be assumed that Moscow also has influence over the allocation of resources within the military and can <a href="https://carnegie-mec.org/2020/03/26/ar-pub-81213">award</a> loyal units and officers.</p>\n\n<p>The other key aspect of the Syrian military is the presence and loyalty of the Alawites. While the Alawites’ hegemonic occupancy of the army heightened after 2011 due to Sunni defections, the community’s relationship with the military institution—and the regime by extension—changed. Their military support of the Assad regime came at an immense cost; they disproportionally <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/07/22/between-regime-and-rebels-a-survey-of-syrias-alawi-sect/">lost</a> much of their youth on the battlefield while their community continues to be <a href="https://www.arab-reform.net/publication/no-homeland-no-future-alawite-youth-as-the-backbone-of-the-assad-regime/">hurt</a> by the growing <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/is-bashar-al-assad-at-risk-of-losing-his-alawite-base-39344">deterioration</a> of living conditions. As the Alawites sacrifice for a regime that is unable to provide them with basic necessitates, their circle of loyalty is widening to include emerging notables who are substituting risky military service with safer militia membership and state services with local charities.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the recent <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/rami-makhlouf-saga-poses-dangerous-challenge-assad">crackdown</a> on businessman and regime financier Rami Makhlouf—<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/syrian-government-seizes-assets-businessman-rami-makhlouf-191224155408157.html">seizing</a> his assets, <a href="https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/1878961/assad-disbands-makhlouf-militias-renames-tiger-forces">disbanding</a> militias he financed, and <a href="https://www.rozana.fm/ar/economy/2020/05/24/%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%88%D9%81-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF">shutting down</a> his charity—can attest to his growing influence among the Alawites and the increasing <a href="https://twitter.com/AbdulrhmanMasri/status/1273645652954710018">vulnerability</a> Assad is feeling with regards to his community’s support. However, the Alawites remain entrapped in the cycle of fear that the Assad regime created, which has isolated the minority community from the rest of Syrian society. This has made Assad—for the time being at least—a necessity for the community’s survival.</p>\n\n<p>While the Syrian military played a key role in securing the Assad regime’s survival, the structures that were once designed to keep its forces loyal have gradually shattered in the past nine years. Although the forced de-centralization, multiplication of security actors, and foreign involvement saved the Syrian regime from military defeat, Assad measures the quality of his forces by their consistent loyalty and willingness to use force for his regime’s defense, not by their performance on the battlefield. While a coup against Bashar al-Assad or a collapse of his rule are unlikely, he no longer has the reliability that existed in the past fifty years.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-09-22T14:52:41+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-09-22T14:52:39+00:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	About Syrian Army	Wanting		Reliable no more?

Shakshi	Mustafa Al-Kadhimi	Individual	https://www.dw.com/en/can-iraqi-prime-minister-mustafa-al-kadhimi-stay-the-course/a-54649541	Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi headed to Washington for the first time this week since taking office in May — the most high-profile stage of a "Strategic Dialogue" expected to re-calibrate US-Iraq relations. But as he left, the situation at home had become increasingly tense.  Prominent anti-government activists were gunned down by unknown assailants on three occasions in Basra this week, a jump that has alarmed human rights organizations. Attacks on US targets in the country, thought to be carried out by pro-Iran factions, intensified to an almost daily occurrence after the trip was announced. It comes as a lack of public services, corruption and economic and coronavirus crises feed into an overall feeling of anger and frustration.  "Kadhimi's visit to Washington clearly angered the Iranian side and its factions in Iraq, as strengthening Iraq-US ties does not benefit them," Iraqi journalist Azhar al-Rubaie told DW from Basra.  Among all the pressures he faces, balancing the influence of Iran and the US is crucial to whether al-Kadhimi, well-known to be close to the US, has the power to stay the course and stabilize the country.  A costly visit  The visit did yield a $200 million (€169 million) US aid package and the announcement of energy and finance contracts. But it could also prove politically costly for the PM, alienating him from powerful pro-Iran elements at home.  "[Iran has] massive equities in the country. It's got the militias, it's got networks of influence, it's got politicians that it's bought and paid for," Toby Dodge, Research Director for Iraq at the London School of Economics, said. "What al-Kadhimi needs to do is keep some distance from Iran, but he can't alienate them either."  Many expected the withdrawal of some 5,000 US troops from Iraq to be top of the summit's agenda but with nothing new announced, their continued presence may be a reprieve for al-Kadhimi.

Pro-Iran armed groups under the umbrella of the loosely government-controlled Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), established to oust IS, want them out. Many of its members are linked to politicians in Iraq's parliament, which voted in favor of a US withdrawal earlier this year.  Although US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to discuss how a withdrawal might happen, President Donald Trump has often stated his desire to pull out. "We look forward to the day when we don't have to be there," he said Thursday.  "The tension is between Trump's transactional, instrumental view that [he] doesn't want to get entangled, and then Pompeo, who sees the fight against Iran as the most important issue in American foreign policy in the Middle East," Dodge said.  Read more: Why the US and Iran are not at war  But the future of US military presence in Iraq was never really up for discussion, according to Ramzy Mardini, an associate at the University of Chicago's Pearson Institute. Instead, after US strikes in January killed Iranian and pro-Iran Iraqi commanders, the strategic dialogue was seen as way to deal with growing anti-American pressure in Iraq, Mardini said on Twitter.  Support in question ahead of elections  Having angered pro-Iran politicians and armed groups, al-Kadhimi now faces an uphill battle going into elections next year.  After a new electoral law designed to break the power of larger political blocs was passed late last year, he's pushing for early polls.  "What he'll try and do is build an electoral coalition which guarantees that he'll come back into power after that," Dodge said. "But I still think because of this Iranian hostility, because of suspicions that al-Kadhimi's too pro-American, he's going to find it difficult to get another term in office after those elections."  Others still have faith he will be able to rein in the militias and bring stability to the country after the recent spate of attacks on activists.  "Al-Khadimi will definitely stop them because he is not loyal to any side and is taking bold actions no one has ever taken," an activist from Basra, who did not want to be named due to the security situation, told DW.  The prime minister's proposal to establish a "supreme committee" charged with investigating major corruption, crime and assassinations has given the activist hope.  "Killing you just for being different from [the armed groups'] dogma is something that security forces should deal with. All party leaders who are criminals should be tried to deliver us a safer environment to live in," the activist said.

Carel	Cyril Ramaphosa	Individual	https://www.biznews.com/undictated/2020/11/03/corruption-crackdown-scoreboard	There has been a discernible shift in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s communications strategy. He replaced his spokesperson Khusela Diko in July after it emerged that her husband had his snout in the bountiful PPE feeding trough.  Ever since her ‘acting’ replacement Tyrone Seale started signing off on statements, there has been a strong drive to get the message across that concrete steps are being taken against corruption. Seale is a former journalist whose byline was prominent in Cape newspapers before he crossed over to the public relations sector.  In addition to regular updates on arrests, and repeated messages that corruption will no longer be tolerated, a score-board has appeared on the government news website, underscoring that a serious campaign is underway. The current figures, alongside an anti-corruption hotline, show that there were 80 arrests, four convictions and about R230m in assets seized in the first two weeks of October.  Law enforcers have some powerful figures in their sights.

Carel	Bill Bickham	Individual	https://eu.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/07/29/program-aims-protect-seniors-financial-exploitation/13347367/	Ohio resident Bill Bickham got in touch with Cocoa Beach police after he learned that big money was being siphoned from his older brother’s bank account and credit card by an employee of the older man.  But when Bickham’s sibling, a Cocoa Beach resident, died at age 87 in 2012, the case against the alleged perpetrator died along with him.  Financial exploitation directed at older Americans is so pervasive and increasing so quickly, it’s estimated that 20 percent of older adults have been a victim.  They’re ripped off by relatives. Caregivers. Investment advisers and trusted friends. Often, they’re victimized by those with power of attorney. Credit and debit cards are misused; pension or benefit checks are stolen; and checks are written without authorization. And, in most cases, experts say, the money is not recovered.  Preventing exploitation  Tuesday, the American Bar Association, the nonprofit Investor Protection Trust and the nonprofit Investor Protection Institute announced a push to help curb such abuse, starting with a program to train attorneys to see exploitation and address it among clients.  The Elder Investment Fraud and Financial Exploitation Prevention Program Legal will be designed to teach lawyers to recognize clients’ possible vulnerability because of mild cognitive impairment; identify such fraud in their clients; and report suspected instances to appropriate authorities.  “Because lawyers play such a significant role in advising and serving an aging society, especially around financial matters, their role in spotting, preventing and responding to financial exploitation needs to be as professional and effective as possible,” said Charles Sabatino, director of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Law and Aging.  “Yet, it is not an area in which many are effectively trained,” he said.  Anything that helps target abuse against older adults is welcomed by the Brevard State Attorney’s Office, said Laura Moody, assistant state attorney.  “Knowing the red flags is so critical, because what we find are numerous exploitation cases where the perpetrator is someone acting with legal authority,” Moody said.  “We don’t see a lot of guardian cases, but we see a tremendous number of power of attorney abuse cases. They’ll get that legal authority through a lawyer’s office and deplete all the principal’s funds. We see trustee cases as well.”  The ABA and IPT recently conducted a survey of more than 650 practicing attorneys nationwide in which they explored awareness of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.  Among key findings:  • More than 9 out of 10 attorneys say elder investment fraud and financial exploitation is a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem.  • More than 1 in 3 attorneys says they are aware they “are or may be dealing with the victims of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.”  • Roughly 9 out of 10 attorneys would be willing to participate in a continuing legal education program “about detecting, preventing, and redressing elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.”  “It’s such a critical issue, that attorneys know their clients well; know their patterns and habits,” Moody said.  “In the past, we’ve asked a few of our civil lawyers to start putting warnings on documents like power of attorney documents. That gives a warning to the person that they know what their fiduciary obligations are, and they don’t have an excuse later, like ‘I thought I could do anything I wanted to do with this money.’ ”  In the case of the Cocoa Beach man, a widower, the alleged perpetrator used her employer’s checks and credit card to make purchases mounting into thousands of dollars monthly.  Not until Bill Bickham learned of the abuse of his brother’s finances did the pieces start to come together — but at least $100,000 was gone.  And though Moody’s office and local law enforcement tried their best, she said, the victim refused to cooperate with prosecution of the alleged perpetrator. His death made it almost impossible to proceed, she said.  “It’s very important that people know what’s going on with their family and that attorneys know about their clients, too,” said Bickham, 76.  “But my brother didn’t have any children. And I’m just his brother, and live out of state. He wasn’t the type to go out and play golf or go to McDonald’s and drink coffee with friends, so there was really no one out there noticing these things.”  The case could possibly have been prosecuted succesfully, Moody said, under enhanced exploitation laws that go into effect in Florida this October.  Changes include a revised definition of exploitation of an elderly person or disabled adult (vulnerable adult). Penalties are enhanced for stealing personal ID information of anyone 60 or older, and there’s a decrease in the property threshold values for exploitation of vulnerable adults offenses.  Along with family and medical professionals noting changes in behavior, it’s crucial for attorneys to see warning signs in their clients’ behavior, both physical and financial — no matter who has power over their finances, said Moody.  “They represent the elder in these cases,” she said. “They don’t represent the person who assumes that power.”  Contact Kennerly at 321-242-3692 or bkennerly@floridatoday.com. Follow her on Twitter @bybrittkennerly or at Facebook.com/bybrittkennerly.  Warning signs  Several agencies can assist older adults who may be victims of fraudulent activity.  • State attorney’s office: 321-617-7510  • Elder Helpline: 800-963-5337  Experts say someone might be a victim of exploitation if they are:  • Taking a large amount out of the bank or other cash accounts.  • Making numerous withdrawals of smaller amounts, say, $100 at a time.  • Changing power of attorney or beneficiaries on insurance or investment accounts.  • Becoming too close with a much younger person or an inappropriate person, or have a caregiver too interested in a charge’s finances.

Carel	James Bufton	Individual	https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2062898/Trainee-stockbroker-17-claims-charmed-pop-superstar-Rihanna.html	Having the chance to charm Rihanna must be pretty high on the list of most teenage boys.  And one lucky young man claims to have done just that, brsgging that he has scored a date with the global superstar after chatting her up in London.  Trainee stockbroker James Bufton, 17, met the stunning singer backstage after her show at O2 arena earlier this week and says they got along so well she invited him to visit her in New York.  Charming: Trainee stockbroker James Bufton with Rhianna claimed he has scored a date with the global superstar after chatting her up after a gig in London earlier this week  The youngster, from Newport, South Wales, even put out a press release saying that he has the Barbadian babe's phone number.  James said: 'She's a really lovely girl, really down to earth, normal and fun.  'Getting to meet her after the gig was a dream come true and we talked about everything under the sun.'  He also claimed: 'We chatted about how the tour is going, her interests, her songs and what she's planning on doing next.  'We even talked about meeting up again in New York - we're going to keep in touch."  The pair met during an exclusive VIP party at the O2 Arena following her huge show earlier this week.  He managed to grab some time with her, resulting in the twosome having a photo together with Rihanna resting her head on the trainee stockbroker's shoulder and her hand on his chest.  But rather than carry on living out his dream, James left early because he had work the next day.  His employer Dan O'Connell said: 'There can't be many guys who would give up the chance to chat all through the night with Rihanna to catch a train so he'd be in for work bright and early the next morning.  'But James is a fantastic young man who is making a real name for himself in stockbroking.  'He has clearly got his head screwed on. He'll go far-who knows, he may even go to New York.'  Rihanna was recently linked with boxer Dudley O'Shaughnessy after the two apparently got together when he appeared in one of her music videos.  She was previously dating baseball player Matt Kemp and, prior to that, RnB singer Chris Brown.

Carel	BAE Systems	Organization	https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2467001/financial-crime-survey-2016-compliance-and-online-fraud-top-the-financial-crime-investment-charts	Since 2007, Operational Risk, in collaboration with BAE Systems, has conducted a series of surveys covering key industry trends in financial crime, risk and compliance. This year’s survey shows continued investment in anti-fraud and compliance solutions. However, the focus and priorities of financial institutions appear to reflect the uncertainty of global markets and the growing impact of money laundering and counter-regulatory measures.  A key indicator of the overall health of the market is the change in investment in the two primary areas of financial crime: compliance and counter fraud. These two areas have seen sustained investment growth since the first survey was conducted in 2007. This comes despite retrenchment elsewhere in financial services (figure 1). This year’s survey indicates significant growth of investment in anti-money laundering (AML) and particularly non-AML compliance: 51.5% of respondents said that AML budgets would increase and 55% said that non-AML compliance budgets would increase, compared with 45% and 49.6%, respectively, for 2013. However, more financial institutions in 2016 than in 2013 say that their AML and non-AML budgets will decrease. This trend does not appear to be reflected in combatting fraud, where an almost identical percentage (41.8% in 2016 and 41.6% in 2013) indicates that investment will remain at the same level.  A shift in priority  We asked respondents what the financial crime priorities for senior management would be in the coming year (figure 2). In 2013 – and for several years prior to that – insider fraud was regarded as the priority for respondents. However, this state of affairs has changed dramatically. As of this year, online fraud is the priority. The growth of remote banking channels, with the proportion of business conducted through online and mobile banking, is a possible explanation. According to the Global Mobile Banking Report, published by KPMG in conjunction with UBS Evidence Lab, this past growth is just the beginning. The number of mobile banking users globally is forecast to double to 1.8 billion over the next four years, representing more than one-quarter of the world’s population. In the US, 74% of banking customers used online banking in 2014, and 35% used mobile banking to access banking services. Payment fraud remains a strong priority, but is down when compared with 2013 numbers.  Insider fraud  Where does this leave insider fraud? In terms of priority initiatives for senior management, the survey revealed that it had fallen to a 5.61 average score in 2016 from 7.44 in 2013, when it was considered the second priority; only cheque and deposit fraud in 2016 are considered to be lower priority in banking. It could be that, as it is notoriously difficult to detect, senior management now believe the levels of insider fraud to be low and therefore of lower priority.  The survey measured fraud detection performance for the first time in 2016, and insider fraud detection is comparable with online fraud, for example, at 39.4% detected (however with a high false-positive rate at 29.5%). This would support an argument that this area has been a focus for financial institutions. However, further analysis of the survey participants suggests that the mix of relevant financial institutions is different in 2016 to that of 2013. In 2016, 32.6% of businesses did not use insider fraud detection, compared with 21.3% of businesses in 2013.  Most current research suggests that, far from being addressed, insider fraud is a growing problem. The Kroll Global Fraud Report 2015–2016, carried out with and conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, found that 60% of companies were defrauded by an insider – a 72% increase on the previous year. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ (ACFE) 2014 Report to the Nations, more than one insider colluding in a fraud is especially harmful, and appears in between 36% and 42% of cases covered by the report. Yet losses from this type of fraud have fallen from a median of $500,000 in ACFE’s 2008 report to half this figure in 2014.  Changes in AML and compliance  Investment in AML remains significant, with 51.5% of respondents expecting budgets to increase over the next three years. The data also suggests financial institutions are shifting slightly towards solving this problem internally, with an increase from 20.6% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2016. In comparison, those going to third parties have fallen from 42.1% in 2013 to 35% in 2016. That said, third-party vendors remain the most popular option overall.  The survey asked respondents which solutions they would build in-house, as opposed to outsourcing (figure 3). This year saw a significant migration to third-party politically exposed persons (PEP) screening and sanctions solutions. Almost one-third (31.3%) went outside their organisations in 2013; that figure rose to 43.8% in 2016. This is possibly explained by the increasing development and focus of sanctions regimes introduced by governments around the world to target organised crime and stem the funding of terrorism, which has forced financial institutions to prioritise investment in this area. The expansion has resulted in a more complex set of actions and obligations and, for this reason, financial institutions are turning to third-party vendors.  Recently, it has been the considered view of many financial crime experts that financial institutions can benefit from combining fraud and AML resources to create efficiencies and identify crossovers. This year’s results suggest the idea has currency, with a more than 10-point jump in financial institutions using consolidated fraud and compliance solutions: 76.6% in 2016, compared with 65.7% in 2013. The trend is also towards third-party vendors providing these solutions, with 21.9% in 2016 compared with 13.7% in 2013.  The rise of application fraud  There has been a trend towards developing tools in-house for specific areas of financial crime. Notable in this group is application fraud (figure 3). Just over one-quarter (25.5%) of surveyed financial institutions now have an in-house solution, an increase of 2.2% since 2013. There has been a decline in the number of those that have a third-party application fraud solution (from 23.7% to 20.8%), and a decline in the number of financial institutions that said that they would possibly outsource their application fraud solution service over the next three years – from 18.3% to 15.1%.  The skewing towards internal spend could be explained in part by the common practice of tackling application fraud with existing fraud solutions. It would be interesting to analyse the impact on effectiveness of application fraud detection over time (beyond the scope of this research), as BAE Systems’ experience suggests that specific application fraud modelling and entity matching is required.  That said, fraud departments are also frequently challenged to justify additional IT spends, so may need to maximise what they have already. We will be watching this space carefully, given the increasing prevalence of the application fraud problem with the global migration towards EMV standard, and would expect the trend to in-house solutions to target this problem to be reversed.  Cyber attack  On the list of priority initiatives for senior management in 2013, cyber crime was included as a general category. At the time, it was cited as the highest priority, with 7.7% of the total.  With the increasing number of high-profile cyber attacks, and the increasingly documented connection with financial crime (the UK’s National Fraud Investigation Bureau estimates that 43% of fraud is cyber-enabled), this year’s survey asked more specific questions about the perceived and likely impacts of a successful cyber attack on financial institutions (figures 4 and 5).  When asked what would be the likely financial cost of a successful cyber attack on their organisation, 36.7% of respondents said they did not know the estimated potential financial impact; 46.7% estimated this to be less than £10 million; and 23.3% estimated less than £1 million. This may reflect some widely reported figures that show that the average payout for a claim for a cyber breach is around £1 million (figure 4).  NetDiligence’s 2015 Cyber Claims Study notes the average claim for a breach at $673,000 and, for a large company, $4.8 million. The UK government’s 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey suggests costs had risen from £600,000 in 2014 to £1.46 million in 2015 for large firms.  Yet this only refers to the direct costs of a cyber incident. The indirect costs can be far greater, and this is recognised in response to the second cyber-related question. Exactly half of respondents believed that the greatest risk to their business was reputational damage, and 30.6% considered loss of customer data to be the greatest risk. Direct monetary loss was the greatest risk for only 8.1% of respondents, which is unsurprising given how easy it is to insure against. In contrast, the damage to reputation can be far-reaching, long-term, and difficult to insure against. Detection and prevention technologies, in combination with relevant insurance protection, can be effective options for the financial institution to manage this risk (figure 5).  In summary, this year’s research has once again provided highly valuable insight into the key trends and the state of the financial crime market. Investment in financial crime defences is increasing, most significantly in AML and non-AML compliance. Leading the trend is the likely move to third-party solution providers for sanctions and PEP screening solutions, but also the move to consolidation between fraud and compliance solutions.

Yet losses from this type of fraud have fallen from a median of $500,000 in ACFE’s 2008 report to half this figure in 2014.\n\nChanges in AML and compliance\n\nInvestment in AML remains significant, with 51.5% of respondents expecting budgets to increase over the next three years. The data also suggests financial institutions are shifting slightly towards solving this problem internally, with an increase from 20.6% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2016. In comparison, those going to third parties have fallen from 42.1% in 2013 to 35% in 2016. That said, third-party vendors remain the most popular option overall.\n\nThe survey asked respondents which solutions they would build in-house, as opposed to outsourcing (figure 3). This year saw a significant migration to third-party politically exposed persons (PEP) screening and sanctions solutions. Almost one-third (31.3%) went outside their organisations in 2013; that figure rose to 43.8% in 2016. This is possibly explained by the increasing development and focus of sanctions regimes introduced by governments around the world to target organised crime and stem the funding of terrorism, which has forced financial institutions to prioritise investment in this area. The expansion has resulted in a more complex set of actions and obligations and, for this reason, financial institutions are turning to third-party vendors.\n\nRecently, it has been the considered view of many financial crime experts that financial institutions can benefit from combining fraud and AML resources to create efficiencies and identify crossovers. This year’s results suggest the idea has currency, with a more than 10-point jump in financial institutions using consolidated fraud and compliance solutions: 76.6% in 2016, compared with 65.7% in 2013. The trend is also towards third-party vendors providing these solutions, with 21.9% in 2016 compared with 13.7% in 2013.\n\nThe rise of application fraud\n\nThere has been a trend towards developing tools in-house for specific areas of financial crime. Notable in this group is application fraud (figure 3). Just over one-quarter (25.5%) of surveyed financial institutions now have an in-house solution, an increase of 2.2% since 2013. There has been a decline in the number of those that have a third-party application fraud solution (from 23.7% to 20.8%), and a decline in the number of financial institutions that said that they would possibly outsource their application fraud solution service over the next three years – from 18.3% to 15.1%.\n\nThe skewing towards internal spend could be explained in part by the common practice of tackling application fraud with existing fraud solutions. It would be interesting to analyse the impact on effectiveness of application fraud detection over time (beyond the scope of this research), as BAE Systems’ experience suggests that specific application fraud modelling and entity matching is required.\n\nThat said, fraud departments are also frequently challenged to justify additional IT spends, so may need to maximise what they have already. We will be watching this space carefully, given the increasing prevalence of the application fraud problem with the global migration towards EMV standard, and would expect the trend to in-house solutions to target this problem to be reversed.\n\nCyber attack\n\nOn the list of priority initiatives for senior management in 2013, cyber crime was included as a general category. At the time, it was cited as the highest priority, with 7.7% of the total.\n\nWith the increasing number of high-profile cyber attacks, and the increasingly documented connection with financial crime (the UK’s National Fraud Investigation Bureau estimates that 43% of fraud is cyber-enabled), this year’s survey asked more specific questions about the perceived and likely impacts of a successful cyber attack on financial institutions (figures 4 and 5).\n\nWhen asked what would be the likely financial cost of a successful cyber attack on their organisation, 36.7% of respondents said they did not know the estimated potential financial impact; 46.7% estimated this to be less than £10 million; and 23.3% estimated less than £1 million. This may reflect some widely reported figures that show that the average payout for a claim for a cyber breach is around £1 million (figure 4).\n\nNetDiligence’s 2015 Cyber Claims Study notes the average claim for a breach at $673,000 and, for a large company, $4.8 million. The UK government’s 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey suggests costs had risen from £600,000 in 2014 to £1.46 million in 2015 for large firms.\n\nYet this only refers to the direct costs of a cyber incident. The indirect costs can be far greater, and this is recognised in response to the second cyber-related question. Exactly half of respondents believed that the greatest risk to their business was reputational damage, and 30.6% considered loss of customer data to be the greatest risk. Direct monetary loss was the greatest risk for only 8.1% of respondents, which is unsurprising given how easy it is to insure against. In contrast, the damage to reputation can be far-reaching, long-term, and difficult to insure against. Detection and prevention technologies, in combination with relevant insurance protection, can be effective options for the financial institution to manage this risk (figure 5).\n\nIn summary, this year’s research has once again provided highly valuable insight into the key trends and the state of the financial crime market. Investment in financial crime defences is increasing, most significantly in AML and non-AML compliance. Leading the trend is the likely move to third-party solution providers for sanctions and PEP screening solutions, but also the move to consolidation between fraud and compliance solutions.', 'description': 'Sponsored survey analysis: BAE Systems', 'probability': 0.96006685, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2467001/financial-crime-survey-2016-compliance-and-online-fraud-top-the-financial-crime-investment-charts', 'dateModified': '2019-10-21T11:39:44+01:00', 'datePublished': '2016-08-08T00:00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class="article-page-body-content">\n            \n                          \n  <p><strong><span class="s1">Since 2007, <em>Operational Risk</em>, in collaboration with </span><span class="s2">BAE Systems</span><span class="s1">, has conducted a series of surveys covering key industry trends in financial crime, risk and compliance.

However, more financial institutions in 2016 than in 2013 say that their AML and non-AML budgets will decrease. This trend does not appear to be reflected in combatting fraud, where an almost identical percentage (41.8% in 2016 and 41.6% in 2013) indicates that investment will remain at the same level.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img src="/sites/risk/files/import/IMG/253/352253/or0916bae-1-resized-540x334.jpeg" class="center" style="display: block;" title="or0916bae-1-resized" alt="or0916bae-1-resized" width="540" height="334"></span></p>\n<h3 class="p2">A shift in priority<span class="s1"></span></h3>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We asked respondents what the financial crime priorities for senior management would be in the coming year (figure 2). In 2013 – and for several years prior to that – insider fraud was regarded as the priority for respondents. However, this state of affairs has changed dramatically. As of this year, online fraud is the priority. The growth of remote banking channels, with the proportion of business conducted through online and mobile banking, is a possible explanation. <a href="http://thefinancialbrand.com/53431/global-mobile-banking-usage-study" target="_blank">According to the <em>Global Mobile Banking Report</em></a>, published by KPMG in conjunction with UBS Evidence Lab,\xa0this past growth is just the beginning.

However, further analysis of the survey participants suggests that the mix of relevant financial institutions is different in 2016 to that of 2013.

The <em>Kroll Global Fraud Report 2015–2016</em>, carried out with and conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, found that 60% of companies were defrauded by an insider – a 72% increase on the previous year. According to the <a href="https://www.acfe.com/rttn/docs/2014-report-to-nations.pdf">Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ (ACFE) <em>2014 Report to the Nations</em></a>, more than one insider colluding in a fraud is especially harmful, and appears in between 36% and 42% of cases covered by the report. Yet losses from this type of fraud have fallen from a median of $500,000 in ACFE’s 2008 report to half this figure in 2014.</p>\n\n<h2>Changes in AML and compliance</h2>\n\n<p>Investment in AML remains significant, with 51.5% of respondents expecting budgets to increase over the next three years. The data also suggests financial institutions are shifting slightly towards solving this problem internally, with an increase from 20.6% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2016. In comparison, those going to third parties have fallen from 42.1% in 2013 to 35% in 2016. That said, third-party vendors remain the most popular option overall.</p>\n\n<p>The survey asked respondents which solutions they would build in-house, as opposed to outsourcing (figure 3). This year saw a significant migration to third-party politically exposed persons (PEP) screening and sanctions solutions. Almost one-third (31.3%) went outside their organisations in 2013; that figure rose to 43.8% in 2016. This is possibly explained by the increasing development and focus of sanctions regimes introduced by governments around the world to target organised crime and stem the funding of terrorism, which has forced financial institutions to prioritise investment in this area. The expansion has resulted in a more complex set of actions and obligations and, for this reason, financial institutions are turning to third-party vendors.</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/import/IMG/242/352242/or0916bae-3-96-540x540.jpg" title="or0916bae-3-96" alt="or0916bae-3-96"><br></p>\n\n<p>Recently, it has been the considered view of many financial crime experts that financial institutions can benefit from combining fraud and AML resources to create efficiencies and identify crossovers. This year’s results suggest the idea has currency, with a more than 10-point jump in financial institutions using consolidated fraud and compliance solutions: 76.6% in 2016, compared with 65.7% in 2013. The trend is also towards third-party vendors providing these solutions, with 21.9% in 2016 compared with 13.7% in 2013.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The rise of application fraud</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There has been a trend towards developing tools in-house for specific areas of financial crime. Notable in this group is application fraud (figure 3). Just over one-quarter (25.5%) of surveyed financial institutions now have an in-house solution, an increase of 2.2% since 2013. There has been a decline in the number of those that have a third-party application fraud solution (from 23.7% to 20.8%), and a decline in the number of financial institutions that said that they would possibly outsource their application fraud solution service over the next three years – from 18.3% to 15.1%.</p>\n\n<p>The skewing towards internal spend could be explained in part by the common practice of tackling application fraud with existing fraud solutions. It would be interesting to analyse the impact on effectiveness of application fraud detection over time (beyond the scope of this research), as BAE Systems’ experience suggests that specific application fraud modelling and entity matching is required.</p>\n\n<p>That said, fraud departments are also frequently challenged to justify additional IT spends, so may need to maximise what they have already. We will be watching this space carefully, given the increasing prevalence of the application fraud problem with the global migration towards EMV standard, and would expect the trend to in-house solutions to target this problem to be reversed.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Cyber attack</strong></h2>\n\n<p>On the list of priority initiatives for senior management in 2013, cyber crime was included as a general category. At the time, it was cited as the highest priority, with 7.7% of the total.</p>\n\n<p>With the increasing number of high-profile cyber attacks, and the increasingly documented connection with financial crime (<a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/Research-2015/Economic-cybercrime-Summary-Report.pdf">the UK’s National Fraud Investigation Bureau estimates that 43% of fraud is cyber-enabled</a>), this year’s survey asked more specific questions about the perceived and likely impacts of a successful cyber attack on financial institutions (figures 4 and 5).</p>\n\n<figure><img src="https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/import/IMG/243/352243/or0916bae-4-540x334.jpeg" title="or0916bae-4" alt="or0916bae-4"></figure>\n\n<figure><img src="https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/import/IMG/245/352245/or0916bae-5-540x334.jpeg" title="or0916bae-5" alt="or0916bae-5"></figure>\n\n<p>When asked what would be the likely financial cost of a successful cyber attack on their organisation, 36.7% of respondents said they did not know the estimated potential financial impact; 46.7% estimated this to be less than £10\xa0million; and 23.3% estimated less than £1 million. This may reflect some widely reported figures that show that the average payout for a claim for a cyber breach is around £1 million (figure 4).</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.netdiligence.com/downloads/NetDiligence_2015_Cyber_Claims_Study_093015.pdf">NetDiligence’s <em>2015 Cyber Claims Study</em></a> notes the average claim for a breach at $673,000 and, for a large company, $4.8 million. The UK government’s <em>2015 Information Security Breaches Survey</em> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/11646347/Average-cost-of-cyber-attacks-doubles-to-1.46m.html">suggests costs had risen from £600,000 in 2014 to £1.46 million in 2015 for large firms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet this only refers to the direct costs of a cyber incident. The indirect costs can be far greater, and this is recognised in response to the second cyber-related question. Exactly half of respondents believed that the greatest risk to their business was reputational damage, and 30.6% considered loss of customer data to be the greatest risk. Direct monetary loss was the greatest risk for only 8.1% of respondents, which is unsurprising given how easy it is to insure against. In contrast, the damage to reputation can be far-reaching, long-term, and difficult to insure against. Detection and prevention technologies, in combination with relevant insurance protection, can be effective options for the financial institution to manage this risk (figure 5).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, this year’s research has once again provided highly valuable insight into the key trends and the state of the financial crime market. Investment in financial crime defences is increasing, most significantly in AML and non-AML compliance. Leading the trend is the likely move to third-party solution providers for sanctions and PEP screening solutions, but also the move to consolidation between fraud and compliance solutions.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2019-10-21T11:39:44+01:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '08 Aug 2016'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	A survey of Financial Crime	Wanting		Financial Crime Survey 2016: Compliance and online fraud top the financial crime investment charts
Carel	Financial Action Task Force	Organization	https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/remittances-and-integrity-how-exist-harmony	Page also available: French, Spanish How do countries ensure that remittance service providers – who are often serving the world’s poorest people – mitigate their risk for abuse by money launderers and terrorist organizations? This important question is addressed by new Guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The United Nations estimates that developing countries received over US$400 billion in remittances from migrants living abroad in 2014. These funds are often the first financial service that migrants and their families use, so it is important that people can send and receive funds with relative ease and at reasonable cost. However, remittance service providers and the governments that supervise them, must ensure that they are not abused by parties undertaking illegitimate activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.  The FATF calls remittance providers “Money or Value Transfer Services” (MVTS), and in its new guidance it dedicates considerable space to explaining the many business models that exist for this type of financial facility, and the ones that provide the best service for people who send and receive remittances. FATF’s Guidance is intended to assist countries, operators in the MVTS sector, as well as banks working with them, to better understand a ‘risk-based’ approach to implementing measures to combat money-laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF). In a nutshell, this means that the measures to combat these ills should be commensurate with the risks they pose. A very clear statement made in this new document is that while there may be instances when operators in this sector are abused by entities carrying out money laundering or terrorist financing, “this should not necessarily result into categorisation of all MVTS providers as inherently high ML/TF risk.” This is a positive sign to the MVTS sector, the banking sector, and governments who are working to avoid a broad-brush risk categorization of the sector that does not reflect the diversity of the providers. The guidance clarifies that the overall risk of any MVTS provider is influenced by a number of factors. These include the extent and quality of the regulatory and supervisory framework, the implementation of risk-based controls, and other mitigating measures put in place by individual providers. The FATF document also includes a section entitled “ Access of MVTS to Banking Services,” which confirms growing concern that banks are terminating relationships with MVTS, and is an explicit acknowledgement that this issue warrants attention at the international level. This is a timely and helpful addition to the ongoing global conversation about remittance service providers' access to bank accounts. It complements work already published by the World Bank in November 2015 concerning this topic. The World Bank is an observer to the FATF. The majority of FATF members are developed countries, and the Bank plays an important role in providing a voice for developing countries who are not FATF members. Our team here actively provided inputs on the drafting of this Guidance, which is particularly relevant in the context of broader development agenda to achieve financial inclusion. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which provides the detailed framework for the post-2015 development agenda, calls on the global community to address the most significant obstacles to the continued flow of remittances, including the withdrawal of banks from this business line. This guidance will help increase understanding among banks, governments, and MVTS providers as they grapple with managing risks imposed by “bad actors” in the system – without negatively affecting legitimate business.

Shakshi	Leonid Pasechnik	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Pasechnik	On 21 November 2017, armed men in unmarked uniforms took up positions in the center of Luhansk in what appeared to be a power struggle between the head of the republic Igor Plotnitsky and the (sacked by Plotnitsky) LPR appointed interior minister Igor Kornet. [5] [6] Three days later the website of the separatists stated that Plotnitsky had resigned "for health reasons. Multiple war wounds, the effects of blast injuries, took their toll." [7] The website stated that Pasechnik had been named acting leader "until the next elections." [7] Russian media reported that Plotnitsky had fled the unrecognised republic on 23 November 2017 to Russia. [8] On 25 November the 38-member People's Council of the LPR unanimously approved Plotnitsky's resignation. [9] Pasechnik declared his adherence to the Minsk accords, claiming "The republic will be consistently executing the obligations taken under these agreements." [10] On 30 March 2018 Pasechnik stated "Our [LPR] experience can help all regions of Ukraine eventually gain freedom and independence, and then we can together declare a new Ukraine in which representatives of different nationalities and cultures will freely live."

Carel	International Monetary Fund	Organization	https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/how-us-uk-are-together-and-apart-on-fighting-laundering	Law and regulation Bank De-Risking Hurts Charities and Increases Risk of Laundering A lack of access to financial services, particularly the inability to transfer funds overseas, can prevent lifesaving work from being carried out and has touched the refugee crisis in Europe, where many aid groups are delivering assistance. November 4  The United States and United Kingdom recently published detailed money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments identifying both law enforcement and national security challenges. Read together, both the U.S. and U.K. risk assessments provide a stronger understanding of how two leading economies approach myriad money laundering and terrorist financing risks to help stakeholders better identify, analyze, and mitigate the challenges that they face.  These reports support the broader legal and policy architecture around anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism of each country using the risk-based approach under the Financial Action Task Force, and comport with applicable FATF guidance. Although the reports cover the same general subjects, they suggest both similarities and differences in how the two nations view various threats.  What follows is a comparative analysis of the assessments' structure and scope, as well as how they treated the specific issues of beneficial ownership and digital currencies.  Structure and Scope  The U.K. and U.S. assessments both identified threats, vulnerabilities and consequences within industries impacted by money laundering and terrorist financing.  The U.K. took an empirical approach, attempting to quantify the levels of risk within each industry and giving each a "score" based on a range of factors. The attempt to measure and quantify risk by industry and payment method was creative, but the result does not appear sufficient to clarify stakeholders' obligations to combat laundering using a risk-based approach. The U.K. report also included an assessment of its government's capabilities. It recognized that some supervisory regimes were "inconsistent" and described the law enforcement response to money laundering until 2012 as "weak."  The U.S. assessments, by contrast, focused primarily on government and law enforcement efforts to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. The assessments were drafted by Treasury's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, in consultation with other government offices. The U.S. reports were exhaustively researched, examining over 5,000 money-laundering indictments and other charging documents, along with 229 terrorism-related cases.  Like the U.K. report, the U.S. assessments identified risks and vulnerabilities within impacted industries. However, the terrorist-financing assessment contained no explicit private sector input, while private sector participation in the money laundering assessment was indirect – through submission of suspicious activity and currency transaction reports reviewed and analyzed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. One analysis suggested that the U.S. reports should be understood in the context of the current FATF peer review of the U.S. AML and CFT framework, scheduled for public release in January 2016, which may suggest another audience that the U.S. was attempting to engage through its assessment.  The most striking dissimilarity in the structure of the reviews is that the U.K. assessment combined its money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments into one report, the National Risk Assessment, while the U.S. analysis split the two topics into separate assessments: the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and the National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment.  The U.K. report primarily focused on money laundering, with only the final chapter devoted to terrorist financing. However, it emphasized that terrorists often use the same methods to raise, store and move funds as those involved in laundering money, which partially explains why its terrorist financing assessment was so brief. In contrast, the U.S. terrorism financing report thoroughly explored many ways that terrorists obtain financing – including kidnapping for ransom, drug trafficking, and individual fundraising not affiliated with a charitable organization – none of which were in the U.K. report.  Beneficial Ownership  Both the U.S. and U.K. reports discussed the complex and politically charged issue of beneficial ownership. In the banking context, a beneficial owner is the individual who owns or controls a bank account. The use of nominees and shell companies, along with providing inaccurate beneficial owner information, were identified as vulnerabilities to banks.  The U.K. report dedicated an entire chapter to the money laundering threats and vulnerabilities posed by legal entities and arrangements such as companies, trusts, and partnerships with hidden owners. Importantly, the U.K. report described how corporate structures could be used to hide the natural individuals directing those structures. The report also identified information gaps in so-called "high-end" money laundering activities facilitated by professional enablers, particularly those in the legal and accounting fields, using financial institutions and real estate.  The U.S. money laundering report addressed beneficial ownership as one of five money laundering vulnerabilities to the financial system. Nominees and the misuse of legal entities were listed as risks as well.  As the U.S. money laundering report notes, the United States still does not have a federal beneficial ownership requirement for legal entities, although Fincen's proposal requiring stronger bank customer due diligence procedures is awaiting publication as a final rule. In July 2015, the International Money Fund published a particularly critical technical note that both described the AML and CFT risks posed by the lack of U.S. beneficial ownership legislation and suggested possible deficiencies in the pending Fincen rule.  These details are important because the White House recently published a statement mentioning the risk assessments as evidence of the United States fulfilling its pledges under the G-20 Beneficial Ownership Action Plan. In its statement, the White House renewed its commitment to advocate for comprehensive legislation to impose a beneficial owner requirement. But beneficial ownership reforms remain a contested political issue here. Some in the U.S. legal community contend that stronger requirements would undermine client confidentiality while state-level officials claim collecting the information would be burdensome.  Digital Currencies  Both the U.S. and U.K. reports evaluated the AML and CFT risks and vulnerabilities related to virtual currencies.  Virtual currencies are not currently regulated in the U.K. However, in August 2014, the U.K. government announced a "major programme of work" and published a call for information related to the risks and benefits of virtual currencies, and to whether government regulation was necessary. In March 2015, the U.K. government published its findings, concluding there is a "strong case" for introducing AML regulations. The U.K. report, using its scoring system, nevertheless deemed the current money-laundering risk associated with virtual currencies "low." The report said misuse of virtual currencies was primarily related to cybercrime and there was "little evidence" that virtual currencies have been "incorporated into established money laundering techniques." The report also concluded that criminals involved in terrorist financing were not currently using virtual currencies to raise funds, pay for infrastructure or move money into and out of the country.  The U.S. is a step ahead of the U.K. in terms of regulating digital currencies. In March 2013, Fincen issued interpretive guidance clarifying that administrators and exchangers of digital currency are "money transmitters" under a July 2011 rule, thereby obligating them to comply with the AML and CFT regulations that apply to money transmitters. Fincen announced its first digital currency enforcement action in 2015. Also, in June 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services released its regulatory framework for digital currency firms.  According to the U.S. money laundering report, although dealers in virtual currency are subject to the same U.S. regulations as other money transmitters and face the same risks of prosecution for misfeasance, money laundering vulnerabilities continue to mount. Risks tied to virtual currency include the rapid evolution of the market, spurred by more involvement from the technology sector, and the potential of some virtual currency dealers to operate without a domestic presence.

Carel	Joe Biden	Individual	https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13123612/election-2020-biden-win-vitriol-us-politics-count/	JOE Biden told supporters "we're going to win" and warned Americans against "partisan warfare" as he edges towards a White House win.  The Democrat boasted last night he was surging past Donald Trump with a “clear majority” in the race for the White House.  Biden told the rally in Delaware that he was on course for more than 300 Electoral College votes as the battle for Arizona and Pennsylvania drags on.  "We're going to win this race," he said as the tense count continued, citing how the Dems "rebuilt the blue wall that crumbled just four years ago."  He also appealed for people to be more "civil with one another" as ugly scenes broke out across the country with protesters clashing and gun-wielding mobs storming vote counts.  The Democrat said: "We may be opponents, but we're not enemies. We're Americans.  Their nail-biting battle continues as:  Biden, who took to the podium alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, again urged Americans to be patient and acknowledged that "tensions can run high" during a tough election.  "Let the process work out as we count all the votes," he said from the stage in Wilmington, shortly after 10.45pm local time. "Your vote will be counted."  Biden said he didn't care how much people tried to hinder or stop the vote count as after Trump repeatedly made claims of voter fraud.  He resolved not to "fan the flames of conflict but to solve conflict" but to "leave the anger and demonization behind us."  The former vice president said: "We’re certainly not going to agree on a lot of issues but at least we can agree to be civil with one another.  "My responsibility as president will be to represent the whole nation. And I want you to know that I’ll work as hard for those who voted against me as those that voted for me.  "That’s the job. That’s the job. It’s called the duty of care, for all Americans.”  But Trump accused his rival of “wrongfully” claiming the presidency on Friday evening.  The president also warned that his legal action against battleground states was "just beginning".  Trump, who has been holed up in the White House all day, tweeted: "Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President.  "I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!"  He went on to cast more doubt on mail-in ballots, tweeting: "I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by.  "Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!"  BIDEN HIS TIME  Biden seems increasingly certain of victory, but a final vote count is still not expected until days from now.  The Democrat faces a nail-biting wait as votes are counted in Pennsylvania – which could seal the White House for him – and Georgia announced a recount.  A win in the Keystone State would see Biden sail past the 270-threshold needed to win the electoral college and take the presidency.  Currently he is just 17 votes away from becoming the President-elect.  But a Supreme Court ruling last night ordered late mail-in ballots that arrived in Pennsylvania after election day be counted seperately - as Republicans hope to get them scrapped entirely.  And Philadelphia City Commissioner's office said yesterday there are still an estimated 40,000 ballots yet to be counted.  One official added: "it may take several days to complete the reporting of that."  Trump on Wednesday alleged there was “tremendous corruption” surrounding mail-in ballots in a number of battleground states.  But yesterday Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney shot down the president's claims of voter fraud.  He said: "While some, including the President, continue to spew baseless claims of fraud... what we have seen here in Philadelphia is democracy plain and simple."  Flailing Trump has refused to admit he is beaten and is reportedly "planning a victory rally" this weekend.  'RACE IS NOT OVER'  While his camp insist he still has a chance of winning the race to the White House.  Matt Morgan, the President's general counsel, said: " This election is not over.  "The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final.  "Georgia is headed for a recount, where we are confident we will find ballots improperly harvested, and where President Trump will ultimately prevail."  Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Secretary of State, announced Friday: "Georgia still too close to call, but results will be very close, and there will be a recount. Promises transparency."  Sources said Trump would refuse to concede – even if Biden was declared the winner – and his son Don Trump Jr urged him to “go to war” over the result.  But Andrew Bates, a senior member of Biden's team, hit back: "As we said on July 19th, the American people will decide this election.  "And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House."  The former VP looks set to capture the 20 electoral votes from Pennsylvania, which would propel him into the White House, making him the 46th President of the United States.  Biden has fought back a deficit of nearly 1million votes in the Keystone State after a huge surge in mail-in ballots which Trump branded "fraudulent" and demanded counting be stopped.  A victory in PA would put the Democrat firmly over the 270 electoral college vote mark ending Trump's explosive four-year tenure in the White House.  Just before 11pm ET on Friday, Biden led Trump by 28,833 votes in Pennsylvania, where 96 percent of the votes have been voted.  23  A recount in Pennsylvania will be automatically triggered if the margin of the final vote is 0.5 percent or less.  Biden was leading Trump by 7,248 votes in Georgia – where 99 percent of the votes bad been counted by 9pm – at 49.42 percent .  The President blamed a burst water piper for his trailing behind in the Peach state.  During a press conference last night, Trump said: "In Georgia a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened."  Winning Georgia would give Biden 269 electoral votes - meaning he would effectively have a clear path to the Oval Office.  No Democrat has carried Georgia since 1992 when Bill Clinton flipped the state against George W Bush.  Biden could also win the election if he secures Georgia's electoral votes while maintaining his current lead in Arizona.  The Associated Press and Fox News called The Grand Canyon State for Biden, where he is ahead of Trump by 29,861 votes at 49.72 percent to 48.8 percent.  A record number of Americans voted in this historic election as the country battles the Covid-19 pandemic.  Those voting in person joined 102 million citizens who voted early, a figure that represents 73 percent of the total turnout of the 2016 election.  A lot of the mail-in ballots that are still being counted have come from Democrat-leaning counties, which explains Biden's gains since Tuesday.  NO FLY ZONE  Meanwhile, a no-fly zone was put into place on Election Day over the area of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.  According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the temporary flight restrictions were put in place for special security reasons.  The rule is set until Saturday, November 7.  Another physical signs of Biden’s march to what appeared an inevitable victory is his bodyguard Secret Service detail was increased considerably.  An increase in security is a typical operation when someone is likely to become US President-elect.  As Biden waited for the keys to the White House at his home in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday, he declared he was doing everything possible to “protect” the election.  He tweeted: “The people will not be silenced, be bullied, or surrender. No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.  “America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.”  It comes after Trump accused Democrats of trying"steal" the election in an incredible speech from the White House last night.  Bitter Trump singled out mail-in ballots which he suggested were suspicious in being "overwhelmingly" for Biden.  The President told reporters: "If you count the legal votes I easily win. If you count the illegal votes – they can try to steal the election from us."  HOLDING A RECOUNT  Joe Biden has a slender lead over Donald Trump in the race to 270 electoral votes.  The Democrat has so far flipped three states that Trump won in 2016 – Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona.  But the President wants a recount of votes in Wisconsin and has filed lawsuits to stop vote counting in both Michigan and Pennsylvania.  The recount of votes can be complicated because the guidelines are set at state and sometimes local levels.  THE RULES  Wisconsin – a recount cannot be requested until election results are verified on December 1. State rules also dictate that a recount can only be requested by a candidate if the race is separated by a margin of one per cent or less.  Michigan – the state conducts an automatic recount if candidates are separated by a margin of 2,000 total votes or less. To get a recount by request, a campaign must submit a petition over alleged fraud or counting errors within 48 hours.  Pennsylvania – the state only provides an automatic recount if the race is separated by a margin of 0.5 percent or less, or if election officials find irregularities in the results  Georgia - a candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5% and that request must be made within two day of the results being certified.  Trump vowed he would not allow unfounded "corruption to steal such an important election" or "silence" GOP voters after debunked voter fraud claims flooded social media.  "They did the mail in ballots where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on," he raged. "I told everybody that these things would happen."  "I've already decisively won," Trump insisted, hours after Biden said he had "no doubt" he had won the nail-biting battle for the Oval Office.  Citing his victories in Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa, Trump declared that there was "no blue wave that they predicted" as he touted Republican gains in the House.  " Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, and big tech," he told reporters, as the counting continued in key states like Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona yesterday.  "The Republicans have become the party of the American worker," Trump added, before slamming the "phony" media polling, which he claimed was "election interference in the truest sense of that word."  Why is Trump taking his election battle to court  Trump has filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan.  He was demanding better access for Republican observers to locations where ballots are being counted.  A statement from the campaign said in Michigan that they haven't been given "meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law."  The Georgia lawsuit filed in Chatham County essentially asks a judge to ensure the state laws are being followed on absentee ballots  The Trump campaign also filed a lawsuit to intervene in a Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court that deals with whether ballots received up to three days after the election can be counted.  A spokesman for Trump’s team said: “This is the most important election of our lifetime, and President Trump made clear our path forward last night: ensure the integrity of this election for the good of the nation.  “Bad things are happening in Pennsylvania. Democrats are scheming to disenfranchise and dilute Republican votes. President Trump and his team are fighting to put a stop to it.”  Separately in Nevada, GOP lawyers had already launched legal challenges involving absentee votes in Nevada, specifically contesting local decisions.		random	USA 2020 election	Wanting		US Election – Joe Biden vows ‘we’re going to WIN’ and warns against ‘partisan warfare’ as count drags on
Carel	Cristina Velez	Individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/large-corporate-landlords-have-filed-10-000-eviction-actions-five-n1244711	In early September, Cristina Velez lost her job running the staffing team on a Covid-19 treatment trial. Faced with a $2,440 rent bill on the Boca Raton, Fla., home she shares with her daughter, Velez began calling her landlord, Progress Residential, to ask whether it would give her time to come up with the money.  "I told them I was affected by Covid, but it didn't matter to them," Velez said. "They are not very patient."  On Sept. 8, Progress gave her an ultimatum — pay the rent or deliver the premises, a Palm Beach County court filing shows. Just over two weeks later, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Velez, demanding $4,210.14 in rent and legal fees, delivering the papers to her door.  Not once, Velez said, did Progress representatives tell her about a nationwide eviction moratorium ordered by the federal government to let tenants hurt by Covid-19 stay in their homes if they couldn't pay their rent. The moratorium, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sept. 4, bars landlords from evicting tenants who affirm that they've been harmed by the coronavirus for nonpayment of rent.  "I said, 'There's got to be something for people affected by Covid and being furloughed,'" Velez, 46, reported telling Progress. "There's nothing we can do," the company representative replied, she said.  Velez said she sold her car to pay Progress.  From early September to Oct. 17, despite the CDC eviction ban, almost 10,000 eviction actions have been filed in 23 counties in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas by large corporate landlords like the one that owns Velez's house, court documents show. After at least one landlord group lobbied the Trump administration, the CDC clarified its ban on Oct. 9, opening the door for still more such actions. New eviction filings have jumped since then, court records show. During the week of Oct. 12, for example, almost 2,000 proceedings were recorded in the five states, almost twice the number from the previous week.  The evictions are part of a database compiled by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that examines the impact of private equity on communities. It began compiling eviction statistics after the pandemic hit, although it isn't known how many evictions are related to the coronavirus.  Large landlords filing numerous evictions include prosperous U.S. public companies like Invitation Homes, which owns and leases 80,000 single-family homes nationwide. The company is thriving — its earnings rose by 54 percent for the first six months of the year, and its stock price has jumped by 80 percent since the market bottomed out in March. Court records show 122 eviction filings by Invitation Homes in the five states during the period.  Velez's eviction action is one of 97 cases filed against tenants by Progress Residential since the CDC announced its ban. Progress, a large and well-funded landlord, owns and leases 40,000 single-family homes nationwide. It is owned by Pretium Partners, a $3 billion hedge fund that invests in distressed properties.  A spokesman for Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Velez in the eviction filing.  In a statement, the spokesman said: "Progress Residential continually engages with tenants on matters related to their leases. While each matter is unique, we are committed to working with tenants, as appropriate, to try and provide assistance during these extraordinary times.  "Progress Residential complies with applicable law, including the CDC Moratorium, in enforcing rental evictions. Importantly, as part of the CDC Moratorium, tenants are required to provide a declaration that makes clear they are unable to pay rent due to the impact of Covid-19."  Pretium, the company that owns Progress Residential, is overseen by Donald Mullen, a former Goldman Sachs partner who headed the bank's mortgage and credit operation until he left in 2012. Mullen's work at Goldman emerged in a 2010 Senate investigation into the causes of the mortgage crisis when investigators published a 2007 email he wrote about the "serious money" Goldman was poised to make as the mortgage market began to collapse.  Through a spokesman, Mullen declined an interview request about eviction proceedings by Progress Residential and his work at Pretium and Goldman.  'This is a Swiss cheese policy': Julián Castro reacts to Trump's eviction ban  Sept. 5, 202007:17  Other big landlords filing evictions are owned by private equity firms, such as the Carlyle Group, with 42 actions, the documents show. The top eviction filer, according to the documents, is Ventron Management LLC, a Canadian real estate firm that has brought 281 proceedings.  "The decisions of large companies to advance evictions despite the moratorium quite literally threatens the health of residents and the broader public," said Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. He said the five-state figures are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg.  Kristi DesJarlais, senior vice president at Invitation Homes, cast doubt on the eviction figures collected by the nonprofit. "We question the veracity of the list," she said.  In addition, she said eviction wasn't a course the company wants to pursue. "We have been doing what the CDC order directs since early in the pandemic," she said in a statement, "working with our residents facing Covid-related financial hardships and offering a variety of payment options so they can stay in their homes."  Ventron didn't respond to an email seeking comment. A Carlyle spokeswoman declined to provide an on-the-record statement.  'An overreach of authority'  When it announced the ban on Sept. 1, the CDC said it was crucial to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Many tenants, out of work because of Covid-19 shutdowns, are struggling to pay their rent; the CDC estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their homes without eviction protections in place.  The CDC action followed the expiration in late August of a narrower eviction moratorium in the CARES Act. Under the CDC ban, tenants are responsible for paying the full amount of rent owed.  The recent rise in evictions may be related to a new CDC notice on Oct. 9 clarifying the terms of the ban, tenant advocates say.  August: Pennsylvania renters fear eviction during pandemic  Sept. 1, 202003:04  The new CDC notice specifies that landlords can begin eviction proceedings now, even though they aren't supposed to remove tenants before the end of the year. The new notice also said landlords aren't required to notify tenants about the ban or its terms.  Landlords are also free to challenge tenants' sworn attestations of harm from Covid-19, according to the CDC's clarification, and the agency made it clear that there is no administrative appeal process for tenants faced with such challenges.  The notice from the CDC this month narrowed what had been a broad ban on evictions, tenant groups say, and it gave landlords the upper hand. They warn that a tsunami of homelessness will result, along with lasting financial damage to renters.  It "puts more power back in the hands of landlords at the expense of low-income renters," said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit. "It creates new burdens for renters and creates new holes in protections for renters."  A spokesman for the CDC didn't respond to a request for comment about the initial ban and the subsequent changes to it.  Landlord advocacy groups criticized the initial ban and lobbied to change it. One, the National Apartment Association, took credit for the CDC's clarification, describing on its website " first-hand conversations with the Trump administration and the U.S. Department of Justice" to battle the ban. The association and other landlord groups are also contesting the legality of the moratorium in court.  "From our perspective, the CDC order was an overreach of their authority, and landlords needed clarification on how to proceed," said Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive of the National Apartment Association. "It's been seven months, and we have members experiencing some financial burdens as a result and carrying a lot of debt."  'Ethically challenged evictions'  While the CDC ban centers on Covid-19-related harm among renters, it doesn't bar evictions for other reasons, such as those related to health and safety threats by tenants, property damage or criminal activities.  Eviction filings tallied by the nonprofit may well include such cases. But some who work in evictions say landlords at times make faulty claims when pursuing them.  Joe Ferguson is a constable in Pima County, Arizona, and among his tasks is delivering eviction notices to tenants. He works to help combat their removal and explain what their options are.  Many evictions in Pima County are wrongful and violate the CDC moratorium, Ferguson said.  "As we get closer to Dec. 31, there is intense pressure by some landlords to push through ethically challenged evictions," Ferguson said. "Some evictions need to go forward, but in other cases it's people relying on the legal system to go through loopholes."  As new eviction filings pile up, so do difficulties for tenants. Because evictions can appear on tenants' credit reports, renters may have more difficulty finding new homes, with other landlords likelier to reject their applications. Evictions often push renters into poverty, research shows, with mental and physical health declining along with the likelihood of finding a job.  The recent rise in eviction filings will push many renters to move out even if they qualify to remain in their homes under the CDC ban, tenant advocates say.  "In many states around the country, you can't cure an eviction once it is filed," said Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project. "People are going to get notices and are going to feel they've been evicted and will move out. The CDC order created an incentive for unethical behavior by landlords."  Pinnegar said the National Apartment Association is encouraging its members "to operate in a legal and lawful manner." He said he doesn't expect massive homelessness.  To be sure, the coronavirus has imperiled small, local landlords who have limited cash to sustain their operations. Tenant groups worry that those landlords will be forced to sell their properties to bigger operations, increasing the number of rental units in the hands of institutional landlords.  One consolidation deal was announced Oct. 19, when Pretium Partners, Progress Residential's owners, announced a joint purchase of Front Yard Residential Corp., a public real estate investment trust that owns 14,500 rental homes, with Ares Capital, a private equity firm. Front Yard has filed 97 eviction proceedings in the five states since Sept. 1, the documents show. Pretium and Ares said they will pay $2.4 billion for Front Yard.  After the deal goes through, Pretium will be the nation's second-largest owner and operator of single-family rental homes, it said.  In the meantime, other large and prosperous companies that have ramped up eviction filings include Greystar Real Estate Partners, a private investment firm, which has filed 61 eviction notices, and Eaton Vance, an asset management company, with 48 eviction proceedings. Eaton Vance is being purchased by Morgan Stanley in a $7 billion deal; Morgan Stanley itself, through its AMLI Residential unit, initiated 22 eviction proceedings since Sept. 1.  Eaton Vance, Front Yard and Morgan Stanley all said that they work with tenants in difficulty and that their eviction filings were proper and in accordance with the CDC moratorium. Greystar didn't respond to an email request for comment.  Don Smith has also had problems with Progress Residential, although they aren't Covid-19 related. Smith and his family, who are tenants in Apopka, Florida, had to move out in July. He said his wife has stage four breast cancer and uses a wheelchair; facing huge medical bills, they could no longer afford the rent.  Smith contacted Progress and told it that they were leaving the premises; he said Progress thanked him for letting the company know.  But on Sept. 24, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Smith in court, demanding payment of rent owed and legal fees amounting to $4,218.37.  Smith said he knew nothing about the filing until NBC News contacted him. Now he is concerned that he will have to make the additional payment to clear the eviction from his record.  "They weren't a good landlord. I wouldn't call them good at all," Smith said in an interview. "The sinks were rusting out, and they just painted over it. They'd only fix what they had to."  Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Smith.  If the CDC moratorium expires without a replacement, a wave of evictions is likely, housing advocates say.  "When you hit Jan. 1, people will owe tens of thousands in back rent," said Chris Groninger, chief strategy officer for the Arizona Bar Foundation, a nonprofit that helps low-income people. "We are creating poverty as we speak."  By jumping through hoops, Cristina Velez of Boca Raton has managed to pay enough to hang on to her rental home. She has a new job, but she has still had to battle demands from Progress to pay $450 in legal fees associated with her eviction filing.  When Velez challenged the propriety of the eviction after talking with NBC News, the Progress representative told her that the court wouldn't have allowed Progress to make the filing if the eviction wasn't valid. That is false, said Roller of the National Housing Law Project — courts don't verify the accuracy of initial eviction filings.  Velez said the representative declined to detail the process at Progress when she asked about it. According to Velez, he said: "I don't have to tell you what my process is. We have a company to run."		random	eviction actions	Wanting	eviction actions	Large corporate landlords have filed 10,000 eviction actions in five states since September

Carel			https://blog.transparency.org/2015/02/11/secrecy-breeds-corruption/index.html	This week the New York Times is running a series of hard-hitting investigative reports into who is buying luxury apartments in a single skyscraper overlooking Central Park in New York City, called Time Warner Center, and how they are doing it. It has highlighted a dubious bunch of big spenders allegedly enjoying the proceeds of corruption, including criminals and tax evaders.  What the reporting illustrates is that it is very easy for people to hide the origins of their wealth: more than half the luxury apartments in Time Warner Center are not officially owned by individuals but by people concealing their identity through shell companies.  In Europe, this week, Le Monde working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and some 60 news outlets, have collaborated on a series of articles that allege that HSBC, the UK’s biggest bank, gave advice to high-net-worth customers on how they can evade taxes. In addition, the documents show that the global banking giant allegedly profited from doing business with arms dealers who channeled mortar bombs to child soldiers in Africa, bag men for developing world dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws.  The common link here is secrecy. People get away with money laundering and tax evasion because of two big loopholes: the ease of setting up a secret shell company and a lack of oversight by professionals who should be asking questions about the origins of their clients’ wealth and the legality of the accounts.  In the case of New York real estate, much of the money to fund a luxury lifestyle appears to have come from the proceeds of corruption. In the case of HSBC, it is both the corrupt and also high-net-worth individuals who want to hide their cash and evade taxes.  Last year Transparency International launched a campaign called Unmask the Corrupt, to push governments to eliminate the secrecy of shell companies as a way to stop corruption and to ensure that there is greater oversight and due diligence when suspicious customers attempt to buy expensive real estate properties and luxury goods.  The change in laws to prohibit shell companies would be relatively simple. It would require that the names of the real owners of companies (the so-called “beneficial owners”) be made public through central public registries of companies. These public registries would show who owns, controls and benefits from companies.  This approach was recently given a boost by the Group of 20 leading economies and especially by the European Union, which have acted to support greater transparency of beneficial owners by endorsing the use of central registries. The issue now is whether these will be available to everyone. For this, we need to exert greater public pressure.  Nevertheless, central registries would make it easier for banks to comply with their duties to check who their customers really are and whether the sources of their funds are legitimate. They would have fewer excuses for entering into business relationships with clients who are already known, for example, to have connections with arms trafficking, blood diamonds or bribery.  Shells in New York  New York City is dotted with luxury properties owned by shell companies. In the Bloomberg tower on Lexington Avenue, for example, over half the condominiums are owned by shell companies. In The Plaza on Fifth Ave, it’s two-thirds; at One57, it’s more than three-quarters. And the list goes on: at the Time Warner Center it is 64 percent and at Trump International and 15 Central Park West, more than half the properties in each building are owned by anonymous companies.  In fact, the roughly 900 condos in these buildings are worth more than the combined cost of 20,000 average American homes, according to the New York Times reports which quote the statistic that in 2014, 54 percent of sales over US$5 million in Manhattan were to shell companies.  It is simply not clear whether anyone selling the properties followed legal obligations to find out how the potential buyers came by their wealth.  We believe it is crucial to adopt legal measures and fully enforce regulations (where already existing) that require enabling businesses such as banks and real estate agents to comply with anti-money laundering obligations, including providing due diligence checks and reporting suspicious activities.  Transparency International’s analysis of data from the European Union also paints a disappointing picture: among all the suspicious transactions reported in 2010, for example, only 1 in 2,500 was submitted by real estate agents. In Germany, the UK and Italy, national reports reveal the same worrying trend: real estate agents and high-value dealers are not routinely reporting suspicious transactions.  Less of these scandals would break if there was real transparency and accountability in the global financial sector. That’s why we launched the Unmask the Corrupt campaign to try and push governments to mandate the kind of openness that the corrupt are frightened of.

It has highlighted a dubious bunch of big spenders allegedly enjoying the proceeds of corruption, including criminals and tax evaders.</p>\n\n<p>What <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/nyregion/stream-of-foreign-wealth-flows-to-time-warner-condos.html">the reporting illustrates</a> is that it is very easy for people to hide the origins of their wealth: more than half the luxury apartments in Time Warner Center are not officially owned by individuals but by people concealing their identity through shell companies.</p>\n\n<p>In Europe, this week, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/">Le Monde</a> working with the <a href="https://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks/banking-giant-hsbc-sheltered-murky-cash-linked-dictators-and-arms-dealers">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> and some 60 news outlets, have collaborated on a series of articles that allege that HSBC, the UK’s biggest bank, gave advice to high-net-worth customers on how they can evade taxes. In addition, the documents show that the global banking giant allegedly profited from doing business with arms dealers who channeled mortar bombs to child soldiers in Africa, bag men for developing world dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws.</p>\n\n<p>The common link here is secrecy. People get away with money laundering and tax evasion because of two big loopholes: the ease of setting up a secret shell company and a lack of oversight by professionals who should be asking questions about the origins of their clients’ wealth and the legality of the accounts.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of New York real estate, much of the money to fund a luxury lifestyle appears to have come from the proceeds of corruption. In the case of HSBC, it is both the corrupt and also high-net-worth individuals who want to hide their cash and evade taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Last year Transparency International launched a campaign called Unmask the Corrupt, to push governments to eliminate the secrecy of shell companies as a way to stop corruption and to ensure that there is greater oversight and due diligence when suspicious customers attempt to buy expensive real estate properties and luxury goods.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.transparency.org/unmask_the_corrupt"><img title="Click here to help unmask the corrupt" src="https://www.transparency.org/images/uploads/icons-logos/2014_Unmask_Banner184pxHigh_620.jpg" alt="Unmask the Corrupt campaign banner"><br>\n</a>The change in laws to prohibit shell companies would be relatively simple. It would require that the names of the real owners of companies (the so-called “beneficial owners”) be made public through central public registries of companies. These public registries would show who owns, controls and benefits from companies.</p>\n\n<p>This approach was recently given a boost by the <a href="hthttps://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25ae632e-6d60-11e4-8f96-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3RQpQCyABtp://">Group of 20 leading economies </a>and especially by the European Union, which have acted to support greater transparency of beneficial owners by endorsing the use of central registries. The issue now is whether these will be available to everyone. For this, we need to exert greater public pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, central registries would make it easier for banks to comply with their duties to check who their customers really are and whether the sources of their funds are legitimate. They would have fewer excuses for entering into business relationships with clients who are already known, for example, to have connections with arms trafficking, blood diamonds or bribery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shells in New York</strong></p>\n\n<p>New York City is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/nyregion/the-hidden-money-buying-up-new-york-real-estate.html">dotted with luxury properties owned by shell companies</a>. In the Bloomberg tower on Lexington Avenue, for example, over half the condominiums are owned by shell companies. In The Plaza on Fifth Ave, it’s two-thirds; at One57, it’s more than three-quarters. And the list goes on: at the Time Warner Center it is 64 percent and at Trump International and 15 Central Park West, more than half the properties in each building are owned by anonymous companies.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the roughly 900 condos in these buildings are worth more than the combined cost of 20,000 average American homes, according to the New York Times reports which quote the statistic that in 2014, 54 percent of sales over US$5 million in Manhattan were to shell companies.</p>\n\n<p>It is simply not clear whether anyone selling the properties followed legal obligations to find out how the potential buyers came by their wealth.</p>\n\n<p>We believe it is crucial to adopt legal measures and fully enforce regulations (where already existing) that require enabling businesses such as banks and real estate agents to comply with anti-money laundering obligations, including providing due diligence checks and reporting suspicious activities.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency International’s <a href="https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/policy_brief_04_2014_regulating_luxury_investments">analysis of data from the European Union</a> also paints a disappointing picture: among all the suspicious transactions reported in 2010, for example, only 1 in 2,500 was submitted by real estate agents.

Carel	Joshua Sharfstein	Individual	https://marylandreporter.com/2014/08/10/health-secretary-sharfstein-had-too-much-on-his-plate/	Above: Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein in spotlight surrounded by reporters at news conference on Maryland Health Exchange.  This is slightly edited version of a column that appears in the August edition of The Business Monthly serving Howard and Anne Arundel counties.  By Len Lazarick  Len@MarylandReporter.com  It was easy to feel sorry for state Secretary of Health & Mental Hygiene Joshua Sharfstein during the last couple of years. When it was announced he was leaving the department late last month, the only surprise was that his departure wasn’t immediate and that it hadn’t happened sooner.  Instead, Sharfstein will hang on to the very end of the O’Malley administration, before he moves on to The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said he wanted to oversee the implementation of the revamped Maryland Health Care Exchange that was such a flop last year.  Sharfstein seemed a likely person to blame in that debacle — after the head of the exchange was fired. Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was ostensibly in charge of the exchange, but internal documents revealed that he didn’t know much about what was going on.  Sharfstein was the cabinet secretary actually in charge, and if he wasn’t paying close enough attention as the contractors missed deadlines and squabbled, he was certainly paying attention after thousands of Marylanders couldn’t sign up for health insurance.  Too much Dysfunction  Sharfstein already had too much dysfunction begging for attention at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department with that rather antiquated name has the largest single budget in the state; this fiscal year, the department is due to spend $11.4 billion, nearly a third of the total state budget, with half of it in federal money tied mostly to Medicaid for the poor and disabled.  Sharfstein, a Harvard-trained physician, is bright and incredibly diligent, but that was not always good enough to steer an agency that has too much on its plate. It has a dozen major agencies under its umbrella, and several of those agencies have chronic serious problems that the legislature’s auditors and budget analysts have pointed out time and again.  The well-documented problems with the Maryland Health Exchange were perhaps the most immediately visible and controversial. Not only didn’t the website work, but the state may have failed to properly oversee the vendors. And the board overseeing it violated the Open Meetings Law when it was deciding what to do about it.  Assisted living audits lacking  In June, an audit found that the department’s Office of Health Care Quality has failed to fix many of the problems highlighted in at least three previous audits dating back at least to 2004. There are more than 1,300 licensed assisted living facilities in Maryland caring for thousands of residents who are not quite able to care for themselves; but year after year during the past decade, the state health department has failed to do required annual inspections for a majority of them.  The department said it was trying to fix the problems that also extend to thousands of other health care facilities, nursing homes and the like. One solution is to stop trying to do annual visits of every facility, but only focus on the ones with clear problems.  In July, the Baltimore Sun’s investigative unit uncovered a case where a severely disabled child died in a group apartment in the Russett section of Laurel in Anne Arundel County.  It turned out that the nonprofit operator of the group home had been in bankruptcy. The state had not been told and the operator did not have enough money to cover the required staffing for these children and adults with multiple and severe disabilities. The operation was stopped, and the children were moved.  Unspent money for disabilities  The Developmental Disabilities Administration is one of the larger units in the health department, assisting 27,000 patients. Its caregivers manage a wide range of disabilities, from mild to severe. The DDA has thousands of people waiting for services, but three years ago, it was discovered that the agency had left more than $35 million of an $830 million budget unspent, and had to return $25 million to the state treasury.  Part of the problem was the department was still keeping its financial records on paper and had a hard time keeping tracking of its funds. Sharfstein got heavily involved, hired a new director, had large town hall meetings with clients and caregivers to explain the situation and ultimately replaced the new director with his own chief of staff.  At one large town hall meeting late last year in Columbia, Sharfstein showed up late to hear from the hundreds who came to listen and complain. His excuse: He was working on the Maryland Health Care Exchange.  One million on Medicaid  The problems with Medicaid, the Medical Care Programs Administration, are as large as its $8.1 billion dollar budget, complicated by a rapidly growing program that now covers more than a million Marylanders. One-sixth of all state residents now get their health insurance through Medicaid, due to expanded coverage under Obamacare.  But the legacy computer system that processes the millions of claims from health care providers is old and cranky, and the process to replace it, using a special federal grant, has been “long and troubled,” budget analysts said. It got so bad last year, that the department needed to come up with a new development strategy.  This clunky old claims processing makes it harder and slower to uncover fraud and overbilling that goes on in such a huge program, largely perpetrated by doctors, nursing homes, therapists and drug companies.  At a hearing last year, the department’s inspector general estimated that 3% to 9% of claims are overpaid, sometimes because of honest mistakes, sometimes on purpose. That totals from $240 million to $720 million a year — but the fraud unit in the attorney general’s office is catching only a fraction of that amount.  Solutions not simple  Discussing these issues, Del. Guy Guzzone, D-Howard, co-chair of the Joint Audit Committee, said it’s tempting to think that a structural solution, like splitting up some of the health department, might cure some of its administrative ills. But while appealing, that he said wouldn’t necessarily cure the deeper management problems in some of these agencies.  Those tasks will ultimately fall on Sharfstein’s successor. In a few years, we might be feeling sorry for that successor if these chronic issues continue to persist, as they have through at least two governors.

Carel	Jack Reed	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-sec-penalties-idUSKBN17F2AC	NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has introduced a bill to raise penalties for securities-law violations, seeking to pass legislation that stalled in two previous efforts.  The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act of 2017 would increase the limits on civil fines and expand the ability of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to link the penalty size to how much money is gained by those responsible for a violation, or lost by victims.  “This bipartisan bill will enhance the ability of securities regulators to protect investors, deter Wall Street fraud, and punish repeat offenders,” said co-sponsor Jack Reed. “Investors deserve real protection, and the law needs to change to ensure the punishment fits the crime. This bill gives the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street.”  The bill sets maximum fines for the most serious securities violations at whichever is greater: $1 million per violation for individuals, and $10 million per violation for institutions, or three times the money gained in the violation or lost by the victims.  The current fine limits are $181,071 for individuals and $905,353 for firms.  The SEC can now levy a penalty directly linked to the ill-gotten gains only if an enforcement case goes to federal court. The newly proposed legislation would permit the SEC to pursue these larger fines through its administrative process, held before an SEC administrative law judge.  The bill also triples the penalty cap applicable to repeat offenders who have been held liable either criminally or in civil securities fraud cases in the prior five years.  The legislation, dubbed the SEC Penalties Act for short, was sponsored by Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, and Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota.  “The goal of this legislation is to create meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent to crack down on fraud,” Reed said in a press release announcing the bill.  The proposed legislation has far to go before becoming law but the sponsors expressed optimism. It must first be considered by the Senate Banking Committee.  The Republican chairman of the committee, Mike Crapo, and top Democrat Sherrod Brown welcomed the bipartisan effort. “This committee should be discussing ways to strengthen penalties and maximize their deterrent effect, not weaken them,” Brown said. “In fact, Senator Reed has introduced a bi-partisan bill to enhance civil penalties under the securities laws. …. It is bills like that one and others that I hope we can consider this Congress.”  Support in the House of Representatives is unclear, as is whether President Donald Trump would eventually sign such a bill into law.  SENDING A MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE AND BI-PARTISANSHIP  Even in today’s sharply partisan environment, in which the Republican administration is seeking to deregulate Wall Street and Democrats are fighting to preserve the Dodd-Frank regulatory structure, the bipartisanship shown over the penalties bill may not come as a total surprise.  Politicians and their constituents have had Wall Street in their crosshairs ever since the financial crisis and the industry has been an easy target.  This bill could be “low hanging fruit” that displays both bipartisan cooperation and determination to crack down on financial crime. However, this will be the third legislative attempt. The measure is essentially identical to efforts introduced in 2012 and 2015 which ultimately failed to become law.  When asked what was different this time, a Reed press aide, “This bipartisan bill has not changed and neither has our resolve to protect investors and strengthen oversight and accountability of Wall Street.”  “It often takes several years to pass meaningful legislation … and we’ll keep at it,” the aide said.  In his statement for the Congressional Record (here) Reed said, "we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist."  Grassley said the SEC needs strong penalties to protect the securities markets from bad actors.  “If a fine is just decimal dust for a Wall Street firm, that’s not a deterrent,” Grassley said. “It’s just the cost of doing business. A penalty should mean something, and it should get the recidivists’ attention. I welcome the increased penalties for repeat offenders in this bill. That step should help change the dynamic of business as usual.”  Heitkamp said the law would help shield small investors from fraud.  With the SEC coming off a record year of fines (here) totaling more than $4 billion in 548 enforcements in fiscal year 2016, the bar is set high for the agency to surpass the penalty totals. This bill could help keep the fines rolling in.  (Todd Ehret is a Senior Regulatory Intelligence Expert for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

Shakshi	Syrian Army	Individual	https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20201028-fierce-fighting-between-syria-army-daesh-fighters-in-hama/	About 30 fighters were killed in violent clashes between the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and Daesh, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported yesterday.  The two sides have been fighting continuously since the beginning of the month in separate axes in the Syrian desert.  The SOHR stated that the battles are concentrated in the Ithria area in the north-eastern suburbs of Hama and other areas linking the governorates of Aleppo, Raqqa and Hama, where the Syrian army, with the support of Russian air forces, are trying to repel continuous Daesh attacks.  The clashes resulted in the death of 13 Daesh members and 16 SAA soldiers, in addition to a number of regime loyalists.  Though Daesh has largely been defeated in Syria, sleeper cells and small groups of fighters remain in the country and often target oil fields and gas installations.  Since March 2019, the SOHR has recorded the death of more than 900 members of the Syrian army and 140 fighters of its loyalist Iran-backed groups, in addition to 500 Daesh militants during battles in the Badia.

Carel	Financial Action Task Force	Organization	https://theconversation.com/with-increased-anti-money-laundering-measures-banks-are-shutting-out-women-46869	Around the world, women in developing economies enjoy less access to the banking system than men.  Bank account opening procedures, especially requirements to produce identity documents, are a major barrier for undocumented women in developing countries. These requirements are mainly aimed at meeting anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing (AML/CTF) obligations. But the barriers may be set unnecessarily high for women given their crime risk profile.  Economic well-being and development is supported by access to formal financial services to save money securely, facilitate the receipt of money sent by family members, insure possessions and responsibly access credit for small business. Yet 38% of adults worldwide – nearly two billion people - still do not have a formal bank account. This exclusion weighs more heavily on women.  Globally 1.1 billion women (55% of unbanked adults) are financially excluded. The gender gap is particularly big in South Asia where only 37% of women have an account compared to 55% of men.  Women face financial, literacy, geographic and social barriers when they wish to open a bank account. It is an onerous process that requires applicants to produce identity verification documents. Women in developing countries often enjoy less access than men to identity documents. Identity document gender gaps have, for instance, been documented in South America, Africa as well as in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries.  Countries like India and Nigeria have introduced innovative large-scale national identity programmes. These programmes are important, but national identification systems don’t necessarily ensure equal coverage for women. In Pakistan, for example, women are significantly less likely (79%) to have a national identity card than men (90%).  Without the required documents, women can’t open a bank account. There is, however, no clear reason why these identification barriers should be set so high for women.  The real risk  Banks’ customer identification practices are heavily determined by national AML/CTF regulations. These in turn reflect international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  AML/CTF laws require banks to apply robust customer identification and verification measures to prevent anonymous accounts and identity fraud. Where clients pose a higher crime risk, banks must enhance their due diligence measures, require more information and apply more stringent verification.  New, proportional, risk-based standards adopted by the FATF in 2012 enable countries to allow banks to simplify identification measures where crime risks are lower. For such lower risk clients, banks may dispense with verification of residential addresses where that is a standard requirement. They may also accept a letter from a community leader verifying a person’s particulars, rather than insisting on viewing a state-issued document.  Could women be classified as a group of customers that pose a lower crime risk? Compelling statistics suggest so.  Criminality: the gender gap  Criminal justice statistics reflect a distinct criminality gender gap. The International Centre for Prison Studies collects statistics on women in prison. They report that women comprise only 1.5% of prisoners in Pakistan, 2% in Nigeria, 5.1% in Indonesia and 5.3% in Kenya. In fact, the percentage of women in prison is in single digits in nearly 95% of countries globally. Arrest and prosecution rates of women are also significantly lower. Women feature more prominently in only a few types of offences - prostitution, shoplifting, embezzlement and welfare and credit card fraud.  Criminologists are very aware of this gap. A significant body of research focuses on possible explanations for the gap (for example that bias in the criminal justice system may explain a part of the gap), whether or not the gap is narrowing and the few types of offences where the gender gap is small, absent or where women may be in the majority. While the academic analysis and debate continue, the available statistics support the contention that women pose a lesser crime risk than men and that this risk is often significantly lower.  Why do bank practices not reflect this fact? Probably because AML/CTF risk assessments, both at a country and a financial institution level, are on average still relatively crude and because banks may be concerned that a gendered view of clients may be discriminatory.  Improving the system  AML/CTF assessments are generally quite basic. They are often informed by a simplistic understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risk, reflecting mainly anecdotal evidence blended with a measure of common sense. Granular criminal justice statistics, where available, may be considered at a national level but are often not considered by banks in their risk assessments. Banks often lump clients together to avoid accusations of unfair discrimination.  Clients are generally clustered in broad groups such as nationals and foreigners or individuals and corporates, and risk assessments focus mainly on risks arising from the types of products and services such groups may use.  Non-discrimination, however, not only requires the like treatment of those who are alike but also the unlike treatment of those who differ. While gender will generally be an irrelevant consideration for banks, client risk assessments require a consideration of similarities and differences among clients.  Crime patterns differ from country to country and region to region. In some cases women may pose the same or even a higher money laundering or terrorist financing risk to banks. What is required is a reasonable and honest assessment of the available facts and statistics. There is however little evidence that regulators and banks are considering gender-related crime statistics. Ignoring such statistics may unfairly undermine women’s financial inclusion.

Yet 38% of adults worldwide – nearly two billion people - still do not have a formal bank account. This exclusion weighs more heavily on women.\n\nGlobally 1.1 billion women (55% of unbanked adults) are financially excluded. The gender gap is particularly big in South Asia where only 37% of women have an account compared to 55% of men.\n\nWomen face financial, literacy, geographic and social barriers when they wish to open a bank account. It is an onerous process that requires applicants to produce identity verification documents. Women in developing countries often enjoy less access than men to identity documents. Identity document gender gaps have, for instance, been documented in South America, Africa as well as in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries.\n\nCountries like India and Nigeria have introduced innovative large-scale national identity programmes. These programmes are important, but national identification systems don’t necessarily ensure equal coverage for women. In Pakistan, for example, women are significantly less likely (79%) to have a national identity card than men (90%).\n\nWithout the required documents, women can’t open a bank account. There is, however, no clear reason why these identification barriers should be set so high for women.\n\nThe real risk\n\nBanks’ customer identification practices are heavily determined by national AML/CTF regulations. These in turn reflect international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nAML/CTF laws require banks to apply robust customer identification and verification measures to prevent anonymous accounts and identity fraud. Where clients pose a higher crime risk, banks must enhance their due diligence measures, require more information and apply more stringent verification.\n\nNew, proportional, risk-based standards adopted by the FATF in 2012 enable countries to allow banks to simplify identification measures where crime risks are lower. For such lower risk clients, banks may dispense with verification of residential addresses where that is a standard requirement. They may also accept a letter from a community leader verifying a person’s particulars, rather than insisting on viewing a state-issued document.\n\nCould women be classified as a group of customers that pose a lower crime risk? Compelling statistics suggest so.\n\nCriminality: the gender gap\n\nCriminal justice statistics reflect a distinct criminality gender gap. The International Centre for Prison Studies collects statistics on women in prison. They report that women comprise only 1.5% of prisoners in Pakistan, 2% in Nigeria, 5.1% in Indonesia and 5.3% in Kenya. In fact, the percentage of women in prison is in single digits in nearly 95% of countries globally. Arrest and prosecution rates of women are also significantly lower. Women feature more prominently in only a few types of offences - prostitution, shoplifting, embezzlement and welfare and credit card fraud.\n\nCriminologists are very aware of this gap. A significant body of research focuses on possible explanations for the gap (for example that bias in the criminal justice system may explain a part of the gap), whether or not the gap is narrowing and the few types of offences where the gender gap is small, absent or where women may be in the majority. While the academic analysis and debate continue, the available statistics support the contention that women pose a lesser crime risk than men and that this risk is often significantly lower.\n\nWhy do bank practices not reflect this fact? Probably because AML/CTF risk assessments, both at a country and a financial institution level, are on average still relatively crude and because banks may be concerned that a gendered view of clients may be discriminatory.\n\nImproving the system\n\nAML/CTF assessments are generally quite basic. They are often informed by a simplistic understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risk, reflecting mainly anecdotal evidence blended with a measure of common sense. Granular criminal justice statistics, where available, may be considered at a national level but are often not considered by banks in their risk assessments. Banks often lump clients together to avoid accusations of unfair discrimination.\n\nClients are generally clustered in broad groups such as nationals and foreigners or individuals and corporates, and risk assessments focus mainly on risks arising from the types of products and services such groups may use.\n\nNon-discrimination, however, not only requires the like treatment of those who are alike but also the unlike treatment of those who differ. While gender will generally be an irrelevant consideration for banks, client risk assessments require a consideration of similarities and differences among clients.\n\nCrime patterns differ from country to country and region to region. In some cases women may pose the same or even a higher money laundering or terrorist financing risk to banks. What is required is a reasonable and honest assessment of the available facts and statistics. There is however little evidence that regulators and banks are considering gender-related crime statistics.

Carel	Jose Morales	Individual	https://bleacherreport.com/articles/163918-jose-morales-has-earned-the-right-to-stick-with-the-twins	Jose Morales was the early favorite to draw the short straw after Joe Mauer is activated from the 15-day disabled list.  But that was then and this is now.  In the Twins ' past five games, Morales has garnered nine hits in 18 at-bats. He is hitting .361 for the season.  Morales, who was selected by the Twins in the third round of 2001 amateur draft, has accomplished what other more noteworthy Twins, such as Carlos Gomez, Joe Crede, Michael Cuddyer, Delmon Young, Scott Baker, and Francisco Liriano, have failed to do thus far this season. He has not only met expectations, he's exceeded them.  This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who has followed Morales career.  Morales, in parts of eight minor league seasons, sports a .283 batting average. For Triple A-Rochester in 2007 and 2008, Morales batted .312 in 162 games.  The question about Morales has always centered on his defense. He was used at second base, shortstop, and third base in the minor leagues until the Twins decided to groom him as a catcher.  The move has yielded beneficial results, but not enough to dismiss the the reality that Morales is a defensive liability no matter which position he mans.  As a minor league infielder, Morales committed 23 errors in 98 games. As a catcher, Morales committed 41 errors in 334 minor league games. (By comparison, Mauer has only committed 14 errors in 498 Major League games behind the plate).  In 2009, both Redmond and Morales have struggled to keep opposing players from running wild on the base paths. Morales snapped the duo's unenviable streak of allowing 19 consecutive runners to steal a base by throwing out Mark DeRosa Sunday, according to the Associated Press.  Can the Twins really afford to lose his bat from a lineup which has struggled mightily to score runs?  Manager Ron Gardenhire is entertaining the risky proposition of keeping three catchers in the lineup. However, the Twins may not have to go this route if they jettison Redmond, who will turn 38 on May 5, to make room for Mauer.  When Morales isn't spelling Mauer behind the plate, he could be used as a designated hitter or as a part-time infielder. The latter isn't an ideal solution, but it would keep his bat in the lineup, something the Twins desperately need at this point of the season.

Carel	Carl Ferrer	Individual	https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2014/12/30/backpage-com-sold-to-dutch-company-for-undisclosed.html	Dallas-based Backpage.com was sold this week to a Dutch company. The purchasing company's name was not disclosed, pending regulatory filings in the European Union.  Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer will continue to lead the company, which employs 160 workers in the United States. Ferrer said that number will not change with the transaction and Backpage will continue to operate out of North Texas.  But the company's reach expands past the U.S. into 88 countries. With that span, the Dutch deal provides "tremendous growth opportunities outside North America as we continue to improve the online consumer experience for our international users," Ferrer said.  "We launched in some markets internationally some years ago and we're starting to get traction," he added. "In fact, some of those markets are growing double and triple digits. Having a Dutch company own us gives us access to vendors, companies and experts, especially in Europe, where we're having the most success."  The second-largest U.S. classified advertising website, Backpage was launched in 2004 to create an online solution for weekly newspapers to compete with Craigslist for advertising. Today, the site holds more than 7 million postings and hosts 37 million users each month.

Carel	Andrew Colvin	Individual	https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/australia-returns-funds-to-china-from-money-laundering-swoops	MELBOURNE (REUTERS) - Australia has returned around A$215,000 (S$229,813) to China in funds it has seized from money laundering cases as the two countries agreed on Tuesday (Sept 26) to beef up efforts to crack down on financial crime.  Australia has been working with China's "Operation Fox Hunt" to snare suspected corrupt officials who have fled overseas or hidden assets offshore. A handful of the 100 top suspects wanted by Beijing are living in Australia.  Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the payment demonstrated that Australia was a "hostile environment for criminals seeking to hide their illegally-obtained assets".  However, the returned money is tiny compared to the A$4.8 billion in Chinese direct investment into Australia in 2016.  Mr Colvin was in Beijing for talks with the Ministry of Public Security.  The two countries have set up a joint working group to combat financial crime and money-laundering and track down assets linked to the proceeds of crime in both countries. Australian police said the group was the first of its kind with China and would extend the reach of Fox Hunt.  They also plan to formalise future cooperation on a range of crime types, including terrorism, that could impact security in both countries.  China outbound investment has dropped this year as Beijing has clamped down on capital outflows, looking to curb "irrational" investment in property and other sectors.  Australia is among the favoured destinations for Chinese buying housing and commercial property offshore.

Carel	JP Morgan	Organization	https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-bonds-abs-idUSL8N14Q3HQ20160108	NEW YORK, Jan 8 (IFR) - The US commercial mortgage-backed securitisation market is facing a shake-up after new rules clamping down on riskier loan origination spur executives at investment banks to curtail upstart lenders’ access to their bond issuance platforms.  Regulation AB II, which took hold on November 23, is being seized upon by top Wall Street banks as a reason to prune ties with the less prudent lenders.  “It’s been simmering below the surface,” said one mortgage banker. “But now the top 10 guys are going to use their market strength to say: let’s eliminate the guys mucking up the market.”  The sector has seen a proliferation of new, non-bank lenders in the past four years as private equity and hedge funds chased fatter returns by making loans that big banks avoided in dicey areas of the property market.  Their success to date is reflected by their rapid growth. Some 28 non-bank lenders packaged loans in CMBS transactions in 2015 versus just nine in 2011, according to JP Morgan analysts.  But now the big investment banks are focused on the new rule, which requires that each bond issuer designate a senior officer to certify that all information provided about a transaction is true.  That might sound like a standard sign-off. But bank executives are taking this requirement to heart since it could - for the first time - make them personally liable for securities fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission if sham loans are rolled into their deals.  “It’s a know-your-counterparty issue,” said William O’Connor, co-chair of real estate capital markets at law firm Thompson & Knight, explaining that it would take just one bad loan out of a typical CMBS pool of 70 made by different lenders to spell trouble.  “For some of the smaller players, that means they are going to have to go elsewhere.”  RISE AND FALL  Four years ago, a dozen or so major banks that included Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, dominated more than 90% of the CMBS loan origination business.  But those institutions lost ground to firms operating in the regulatory shadows, and by the end of 2015 their share had dropped to roughly 65%.  Their place was taken by larger non-bank lenders like Cantor Commercial Real Estate, Ladder Capital and Rialto Mortgage Finance, which consistently ranked among the top five contributors of loans in 2015 CMBS deals, according to Wells Fargo data.  It is the smaller players, however, that are expected to be most vulnerable to fallout from Reg AB II.  ON THE SHELF  In light of the regulation, big banks have already begun a more rigorous vetting process to decide which CMBS lending partners they will allow to access their SEC-registered bond issuance shelves.  “In 2016, smaller establishments will have less access to the shelves than in the past,” said one senior executive at a major non-bank lender, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.  He suggested Wall Street bankers are using the situation event to support their commercial ends.  “It’s a dog and pony show,” he said.  “But if you cut off the bottom 15 platforms, it’s less like cutting off an appendage than it is more of a nuisance.”  SAFETY CHECK  Leverage in CMBS deals has increased as around 40 lenders competed for commercial loans in 2015.  “Strong lending competition has eroded underwriting quality in conduit CMBS, particularly as more small originators that compete for higher risk borrowers have entered the market,” wrote Meghan Kelleher, a CMBS analyst at JP Morgan in the bank’s 2016 outlook report.  Indeed mortgage debt as a percentage of a property’s estimated value surpassed its pre-crisis peak during 2015.  Moody’s calculated the average conduit deal’s loan-to-value at 118.2% in the fourth quarter, an increase from the prior record of 117.5% in 2007.

Shakshi	Vladimir Putin	Individual	https://nypost.com/2020/11/05/vladimir-putin-planning-to-step-down-next-year-report/	Vladimir Putin is planning to step down next year as speculation swirls in Russia that the longtime president may have Parkinson’s disease, a report said Thursday.  Moscow political scientist Valery Solovei told the Sun that the Russian strongman’s 37-year-old girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva, and his two daughters are pushing him to leave office.  “There is a family, it has a great influence on him. He intends to make public his handover plans in January,” Solovei told the news outlet.  Solovei also suggested Putin may be suffering from Parkinson’s as the president has been seen recently exhibiting symptoms of the disease.  Putin recently appeared to be in agony while appearing to constantly shift his legs, according to footage reviewed by an observer, the Sun reported.  Reviewed footage also appeared to show his fingers twitching as he held a cup that possibly contained medicine, the report said.  Speculation on Putin’s possible departure comes as Russian lawmakers are considering legislation proposed by the president that would grant ex-presidents lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.

Carel	European Parlament	Organization	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_15_5001	Today, members of the European Parliament adopted new rules to help fight money laundering and terrorist financing in the EU, one of the key actions in the European Security Agenda presented last month (see IP/15/4865).  Věra Jourová, the EU's Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, welcomed the vote in Parliament which marked the final adoption of the anti-money laundering package: “Serious and organised crime is driven by profit - tracing the illicit proceeds of crime back to the criminal networks is essential both to detect, prosecute and dismantle those networks and to seize and confiscate their criminal wealth. The new anti-money laundering rules adopted today will help us follow the money and crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing."  The new strengthened European anti-money laundering framework will contribute to the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering by:  facilitating the work of Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money and facilitate the exchange of information; establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes; ensuring full traceability of funds transfers within, to and from the European Union.  The Commission will supplement this legislation by working on a supranational assessment of risks. Both texts fully take into account the 2012 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) (see MEMO/12/246), the international standard-setter in the field, and go further on a number of issues to promote the highest standards for anti-money laundering and to counter terrorism financing.  Work must now begin to ensure this framework, which focuses on greater effectiveness and improved transparency, is quickly and effectively put in place. The Commission will work with Member States to speed up the process of implementation of the new Anti-Money Laundering requirements.  On 5 February 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (IP/13/87) which consists of two legal instruments:  A Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing; A Regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds to secure "due traceability" of these transfers.  The package received the agreement of Ministers in the Council in June 2014 (STATEMENT/14/197). In December 2014, the Parliament and Council reached political agreement on the rules (see news), which was formally endorsed by the Council in February 2015 (see STATEMENT). The Parliament and the Council have adopted the final text.  Following the recent terrorist attacks in Copenhagen, Paris and Brussels, the Council and the Commission agreed to take decisive action against terrorist financing. To enhance the efficiency of the new anti-money laundering rules, the two institutions call for further efforts towards speeding up national implementation of those rules, strengthening cooperation on terrorist financing between the Member States' Financial Intelligence Units, and addressing terrorist financing risks via the EU supranational risk assessment. It is also of utmost importance that coordinated action at international, European and national level to tackle terrorist financing is as effective as possible. The Commission will be examining further actions on countering terrorist financing in the context of implementing the recently adopted European Security Agenda.  The publication of the package in the Official Journal of the EU is due for around June-July 2015. A process to guide Member States in implementing the Directive into national law will be put in place over the coming months (the implementation period is two years).

Shakshi	Fayez al-Sarraj	Individual	https://atalayar.com/en/content/fayez-sarraj-announces-resignation-height-peace-talks-libya	The peace negotiations in Libya are accompanied by a deluge of resignations. The Prime Minister of the Tobruk Parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, announced his withdrawal last week. And it was only yesterday that the leader of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Sarraj, joined him and resigned his post in the middle of the peace talks.  Sarraj announced in an interview on state television this Wednesday night that he will "to hand over the tasks of power to the coming executive authority in a time no later than October". He also urged the High Council's advisory committee to meet and elect a new Presidential Council.  Sarraj's resignation comes amidst a struggle for internal power within the Government of National Accord (GNA) between the circle of the President of the Council and that of the Interior Minister, Fathi Bashaga. Sarraj himself dismissed Bashaga at the beginning of September and opened an investigation into him because of the violent repression of social protests by one of the militias linked to the ministry of the interior. These sanctions were short-lived, as the minister was released only three days later and returned to his post, from which he controls the security of Tripoli, the headquarters of the GNA.  The search for a substitute prime minister is urgent, as talks resume in Morocco next week to negotiate peace in the Libyan conflict. Sarraj has headed the Government of National Accord since the establishment of the executive in March 2016, together with President Khaled al-Mecrhi, following the failed peace process promoted by the UN in the Moroccan city of Skhirat.  The Libyan country has been divided since the 2011 Arab Spring riots. After the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi, nine years of conflict and divisions have left the Libyan population in a state of anxiety. The energy, economic and health crises are weighing on citizens who have been marching in the streets since August against the two opposing governments.  Libya currently has two governments: the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, and the eastern parliament of Tobruk, created in 2014 and associated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Marshal Khalifa Haftar.  In early September the two sides reached an agreement on the need to agree on "major commitments" to end the conflict in Libya, as they announced after the first contact in Bouznika, Morocco. The list of commitments to be followed is not yet known, though the main aim is to secure a definitive ceasefire. The dialogue committees are made up of seven people and will soon announce the first agreements for a peaceful solution in Libya.  The civil war has been raging in the North African country since 2014 and has become an international war scenario involving different foreign powers with different interests on the ground. Haftar's LNA is supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France; meanwhile, the LNA receives military support from Turkey and financial support from Qatar, and has been recognised by the United Nations (UN) since 2016.  Unexpected changes during the peace negotiations  Throughout the week there has been speculation in Libya about the possible resignation of Prime Minister Sarraj. The Bloomerg agency announced two days ago that the leader was considering resigning. No one seemed willing to believe it until yesterday, when Sarraj himself confirmed his resignation during prime-time television.  As a result, the interests and representatives who are leading the peace talks have been turned upside down. The dialogues are in the focus of the international community and currently Russia and Turkey are highly influential in these agreements. For their part, the European Union and the United Nations wish to regain the leadership of the negotiations and, following this resignation, it seems to be more complicated.  As part of this effort, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of the international mission to Libya (UNSMIL) on Tuesday and announced it will fill the vacancy left by its latest special envoy, Ghassam Saleme, in the coming days. Moscow and Cairo support the aspirations of Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognised leader of the executive in eastern Libya and a strong military figure in the country. Following the resignation of the prime minister of the Tobruk parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, both Brussels and the UN are attempting to extol the political figure of Aguilah Saleh Issa, president of the parliament elected in 2014.  The Tobruk Parliament was established in 2014 to replace the Libyan National General Congress after the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi and has control over western Libya.  Libyans no longer want instability  The precarious situation in the country has sparked off the anger of the population. In recent months thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest against both governments. The main demands of the mobilisations are the holding of elections, a social reform package and gas, fuel and running water shortages. Besides, a solution to the energy problem causing constant power cuts in the biggest cities is needed.  In this scenario, Human Right Watch organization has denounced the arbitrary detention of 24 demonstrators in the capital by several armed groups, including a journalist reporting on these protests, beating some of them and using several weapons to disperse the demonstrators. Several armed militias have also been known to take to the streets to clear the marches. The violence escalated until demonstrators in Benghazi stormed and set fire to the East Libyan government headquarters and attacked the city hall. In addition, at least five people have been injured by shots fired by LNA members in the town of Al Marj.  The protests began in Tripoli, Misrata and Zawiyah on August 23, t hanks to a newly formed student movement called Harak Al-Shabab 23/08 that took to the streets to criticise both the eastern and western authorities"for the unbearable living conditions" in the country.  Both Sarraj and Aguilah Saleh announced a ceasefire commitment a fortnight ago, but it has not been accepted by the military forces on the ground.

The Prime Minister of the Tobruk Parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, announced his withdrawal last week. And it was only yesterday that the leader of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Sarraj, joined him and resigned his post in the middle of the peace talks.\n\nSarraj announced in an interview on state television this Wednesday night that he will "to hand over the tasks of power to the coming executive authority in a time no later than October". He also urged the High Council\'s advisory committee to meet and elect a new Presidential Council.\n\nSarraj\'s resignation comes amidst a struggle for internal power within the Government of National Accord (GNA) between the circle of the President of the Council and that of the Interior Minister, Fathi Bashaga. Sarraj himself dismissed Bashaga at the beginning of September and opened an investigation into him because of the violent repression of social protests by one of the militias linked to the ministry of the interior. These sanctions were short-lived, as the minister was released only three days later and returned to his post, from which he controls the security of Tripoli, the headquarters of the GNA.\n\nThe search for a substitute prime minister is urgent, as talks resume in Morocco next week to negotiate peace in the Libyan conflict. Sarraj has headed the Government of National Accord since the establishment of the executive in March 2016, together with President Khaled al-Mecrhi, following the failed peace process promoted by the UN in the Moroccan city of Skhirat.\n\nThe Libyan country has been divided since the 2011 Arab Spring riots. After the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi, nine years of conflict and divisions have left the Libyan population in a state of anxiety. The energy, economic and health crises are weighing on citizens who have been marching in the streets since August against the two opposing governments.\n\nLibya currently has two governments: the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, and the eastern parliament of Tobruk, created in 2014 and associated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Marshal Khalifa Haftar.\n\nIn early September the two sides reached an agreement on the need to agree on "major commitments" to end the conflict in Libya, as they announced after the first contact in Bouznika, Morocco. The list of commitments to be followed is not yet known, though the main aim is to secure a definitive ceasefire. The dialogue committees are made up of seven people and will soon announce the first agreements for a peaceful solution in Libya.\n\nThe civil war has been raging in the North African country since 2014 and has become an international war scenario involving different foreign powers with different interests on the ground. Haftar\'s LNA is supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France; meanwhile, the LNA receives military support from Turkey and financial support from Qatar, and has been recognised by the United Nations (UN) since 2016.\n\nUnexpected changes during the peace negotiations\n\nThroughout the week there has been speculation in Libya about the possible resignation of Prime Minister Sarraj. The Bloomerg agency announced two days ago that the leader was considering resigning. No one seemed willing to believe it until yesterday, when Sarraj himself confirmed his resignation during prime-time television.\n\nAs a result, the interests and representatives who are leading the peace talks have been turned upside down. The dialogues are in the focus of the international community and currently Russia and Turkey are highly influential in these agreements. For their part, the European Union and the United Nations wish to regain the leadership of the negotiations and, following this resignation, it seems to be more complicated.\n\nAs part of this effort, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of the international mission to Libya (UNSMIL) on Tuesday and announced it will fill the vacancy left by its latest special envoy, Ghassam Saleme, in the coming days. Moscow and Cairo support the aspirations of Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognised leader of the executive in eastern Libya and a strong military figure in the country. Following the resignation of the prime minister of the Tobruk parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, both Brussels and the UN are attempting to extol the political figure of Aguilah Saleh Issa, president of the parliament elected in 2014.\n\nThe Tobruk Parliament was established in 2014 to replace the Libyan National General Congress after the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi and has control over western Libya.\n\nLibyans no longer want instability\n\nThe precarious situation in the country has sparked off the anger of the population. In recent months thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest against both governments.

Carel	John Rogers Jr	Individual	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/diverse-perspectives-lead-to-better-decision-making-ariel-investments-john-rogers-jr-pushes-corporate-boards-to-have-their-own-jackie-robinson-moment-2020-11-02	It’s a sorely needed effort. Black households are almost twice as likely not to have any stock-market investments, according to a recent study. Ten percent of Black investors said their investments would fare worse than stock-market averages in the coming 12 months, nearly twice the level of pessimism displayed by white investors.  There’s a long, troubling history behind these investing imbalances, and Rogers knows it personally.  His great-grandfather, J.B. Stradford, owned a Tulsa hotel that was destroyed during the city’s 1921 race massacre. When Stradford fled to Chicago, his son’s legal skills blocked the businessman’s extradition to Tulsa and, he said, likely prevented a lynching. But things weren’t the same after that for Stradford, whose wealth and status were reduced to ashes.  Stradford’s story has deep meaning for Rogers, but he knows there are too many tales of a step forward for Black wealth followed by a step back. And that’s what brings Rogers, the chairman, co-CEO and chief investment officer of the $12 billion asset-management firm, back to financial literacy and economic justice.  Rogers, who also sits on the board of directors at McDonald’s MCD, +0.04%, Nike NKE, -0.96% and The New York Times Company NYT, -1.54%, spoke to MarketWatch earlier this month to discuss his family history and what financial literacy can and can’t accomplish. He also discussed how boardroom “Jackie Robinson moments,” and rethinking retirement-savings policies and business nuts and bolts like supplier contracts, can narrow the wealth gap.  MarketWatch: From a wealth standpoint, what did it mean for your family when your great-grandfather’s business, the Stradford hotel, was destroyed nearly a century ago?  Rogers: It was heartbreaking, and my understanding is when he came to Chicago and tried to recreate his entrepreneurial success that he had in Tulsa, he just couldn’t quite get it done. So he was crushed, I think; psychologically crushed. Never able to have the status and the wealth that he had enjoyed in Tulsa. And I think it had a debilitating impact on our family.  Of course, there’s no opportunity to have multi-generational wealth, no opportunity to pass down wealth from one generation to another when you go through the kind of crisis that he had. And then with my father, my grandfather, my mom being lawyers back then, you couldn’t work for a big law firm downtown. You had to work for other African Americans.  My grandfather was very involved in the Lorraine Hansberry family case that fought the redlining that was going on here in the Chicago area. It went to the Supreme Court and he was able to use his legal skills there again to fight for economic justice and fairness when it came to the historic segregation that was here.  But we never were able to kind of create the wealth that traditional lawyers would have working for big law firms with big clients that could pay big legal fees.  MarketWatch: You started getting stocks at age 12. When your father bought that stock for you, how much of that was linked to what happened in Tulsa, and the idea of building up wealth and starting over?  Rogers: I think it could have been indirectly. My dad was a Tuskegee Airman. He met my mom in law school. He was Class of ’48 and I wasn’t born until 1958, 10 years later, so he had a lot of time to plan for me. At age 16, you’re going to have a summer job, and I became a vendor at Wrigley Field and Sox Park. You’re going to have a checking account at a certain age, savings account, etcetera.  But he always told the story that he was having a conversation with a white lawyer here in Chicago. They got into a conversation about the fact that African Americans were not invested in the stock market, and that was a problem. And this white gentleman told my father, “Well, in your community, you in the African-American community, you should know as much about the stock market as my 12-year-old son does, because I buy stocks for him every birthday and every Christmas.”  So my father vowed that when I got to be 12, I was going to have that same exposure to the stock market that the white gentleman’s son had. And so that was kind of the inspiration for him to put me through that process.  MarketWatch: As you’ve built Ariel Investments, financial literacy is just so much a part of the stated mission and culture. And, of course, there’s your own resume and career. Why is financial literacy so important to you?  Rogers: I’m really channeling my dad, because I found that as I started my career as a stockbroker at William Blair I quickly realized that my white friends that I had gone to high school with and college, they were always familiar with the markets. They became my early customers. Some of them had money from their bar mitzvah, money from their holidays. They learned about the markets from their parents, their grandparents. They were totally comfortable buying and selling.  My Black friends — even those that came from professional families, doctors, lawyers, what have you, academics — they had no knowledge of the market, and when they came to see me, I was sort of showing them something, and teaching them something they had no exposure to.  So I realized that when I got started in my career, I just felt a responsibility to take my dad’s values and try to do what I could to expose African Americans, particularly, to the stock market: Go and speak at churches in the Black community. Go and speak to students in lower school and middle school and high school; try to get interviewed in Black publications to talk to people about the importance of saving and investing, the magic of compound interest.  I felt I should pay it forward by exposing as many people to the markets as possible because I just believe it’s a wonderful thing to be able to compound money as you lived your life and built your career.  MarketWatch: Too little financial literacy is a problem in many places. But why is it that especially so in the Black community?  Rogers: Whenever we got a step ahead, we got pulled back down: Jim Crow laws, historic discrimination that we faced, the lack of education in our communities — all those extraordinary challenges. We know that we were supposed to get 40 acres and a mule after the Civil War. And after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, the new president wasn’t interested in that. We really went backwards every step of the way. Whenever we made progress, something would come back and pull us down again. So, because of the historical racism we faced in this country, we never had the chance to generate wealth. We never had a chance to build multigenerational wealth.  So you get comfortable in the markets if you have some money to invest in the markets, and you have parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who had wealth and invested in the markets, and they can help pass along not only their inheritances, but their knowledge of the markets and understanding of the markets.  But when you have families who are living month to month and taking care of extended families because of the historical discrimination we face in this country, we’re just not going be comfortable in the markets. It’s a foreign concept. If you didn’t get comfortable with it at an early age and then all of a sudden start, if you begin to make a little bit of money, it’s a whole new thing that you’re not going to be naturally comfortable with. The volatility is going to be something that’s hard to live with, without people you can trust who can make you be comfortable and help you be comfortable.  And so inevitably what happens is, we found in research with Charles Schwab SCHW, +3.24% and others over the years, is that African Americans are much more comfortable investing in tangible real estate. Which, of course, is problematic if you live in a segregated city like Chicago — because you end up buying property and parts of the city that don’t grow and thrive, and you don’t have the same kind of wealth-creation vehicle for your real-estate investments.  But there’s a lot more comfort investing in real estate. Also, we’re comfortable investing in insurance products. This risk aversion that’s developed in our community shows up again in investing in real estate and insurance products.  MarketWatch: You mentioned segregation and redlining earlier. When we’re talking about narrowing the wealth gap, how much can a financially literate mind set accomplish when there are so many other external headwinds?  Rogers: You’re exactly right. Financial literacy can only do so much. We feel strongly that public schools should be teaching young people about the stock market and teaching them about investing. And we started the Ariel Community Academy over 25 years ago to help teach kids at this one public school in Chicago about the markets by giving them real money to invest in real stocks, the way that my dad did.  So financial literacy helps not only in kids learning at an early age about investing and savings, but they also learn about financial-services careers that can be so lucrative. And we think it prepares them to be better entrepreneurs if they get exposed to financial literacy at an early age, learning how to budget and all the things necessary to start a business.  But I do think, when I talk to parents about how can you create wealth for your families. I tell them the most important thing is to get your child into the appropriate studies that will allow them to be qualified to work in the parts of the economy where the wealth and the jobs are being created today.  And most people in our community, because of the discrimination we face, we don’t know about hedge funds, we don’t know about private equity. We don’t know much about venture capital. We don’t know about the enormous wealth that is created by these parts of the economy that have just sort of sprung up. If we want to bring wealth to our communities, we have to get our young people exposed to the markets at an early age so they can get career paths that will lead them to the right places.  At the same time, these private-equity firms and hedge funds and venture-capital firms have to start getting out of their comfort zone and stop only hiring people that look like them and hiring from their own communities in our segregated society. We have to hold these institutions accountable.  Pension funds hire private-equity firms; family offices do, universities and hospitals and foundations do. If all those anchor institutions in our community told their private-equity managers and their hedge-fund managers and their venture-capital managers that they had to have staff that looked like America and they had to have leaders in those organizations that look like America, I guarantee you, they would find that talent once the customers asked and insisted on it.  MarketWatch: I want to hear more about the private sector, but first I want to hear more about the public sector: Are there any regulations or tax-code changes or laws that could be changed in order to help close the wealth gap?  Rogers: I was very fortunate during the Obama administration to chair his Council for Financial Capability for Young Americans, and one of the suggestions we gave the president at the end was that we would hope that the government would encourage financial institutions to partner with urban schools in the way that we have. The federal government can’t mandate it, but I think that would go a long way.  If all the major financial institutions in this country, small, mid-sized and large, did what we’ve done with the Ariel Community Academy, you would have a whole different story out there. It would be an amazing success story.  I think the second thing the government can do is follow what’s happening in Australia. Australia has the best kind of Social Security on steroids where they allow all citizens to create wealth and, over a long period of time, have money put aside for their retirement benefits.  [The government can] put tax incentives in place to bring back defined-benefit plans. Right now, all the regulatory and tax law incentivizes corporations — strongly incentivizes corporations — to get out of the pension-fund business, and replace it with the 401(k) business.  And that’s especially debilitating for Black and brown folks coming along, who are not as familiar with the markets. So they’re going to, of course, get into the 401(k) late and they’re going to get in and out, sell their securities at the wrong time. When the markets are panicking, they’re going to panic. They’re going to also be more likely to take hardship withdrawals or loans from their 401(k) plans. All those things conspire for people of color to be able to not have the kind of retirement they deserve.  It would be wonderful if the government could intervene backwards, and go back to the way it used to be, where the incentives for corporations were in line to have strong pension plans. It was meaningful and material and made all the difference.  I was on a call with [BlackRock BLK, -0.81% chairman and CEO] Larry Fink. He’s talked a lot about this, and he was saying he didn’t understand why the press, why the presidential candidates, why congressional leadership wasn’t focused on this issue of the future of retirement income for Americans. And I made the point to Larry that it’s much worse for people of color. This is a crisis for everyone, but it’s a super crisis for folks of color.  MarketWatch: Now getting to the private sector, and boardrooms in specific. You’ve been on both sides: You sit on some boards and in Ariel Investments, you encourage boardrooms to become more diverse. Why do you do that and what have the results been?  Rogers: We can point to now over 45 instances where we have caused a corporation to have what we call a Jackie Robinson moment, and have their first diverse board member. So we’re really quite proud of that, from Sotheby’s BID, +0.78% to Jones Lang LaSalle JLL, -2.53%.  When we talk to these companies, we tell them, “We’re one of your bigger shareholders, we believe in you, we think you’re going to be a great business. But if your management team and your board looks like a 1940s company, it’s hard for us to have confidence in you as an investment. We want a company that looks like a 21st-century company that cares about these issues but understands that if you search for diverse talent, you’re going to have a stronger team.”  There’s a lot of research that shows diverse perspectives lead to better decision making. And, of course, when you have diverse leadership you’re going to have better understanding of your diverse customer base. And that’s really, really important.  As the country gets more and more diverse, if you don’t do this well, you’re just going to get further and further and further behind. And your competitors that get it will race ahead of you because they are going to have better talent, deeper talent and better connections with their customer base.  I know sometimes people think we’re a pain in the ass, because we keep plugging them and plugging them, and pushing them and pushing them. But if a company doesn’t get it, then at some point we may have to decide we’re going to sell.  Under the leadership of our ESG team, we are going to be keeping track of this and then voting against directors a year out if they have not had that Jackie Robinson moment.  MarketWatch: To what extent can ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance] investing close the racial wealth gap?  Rogers: I always use the example of the University of Chicago, where I’ve been a long time trustee, close to 20 years. We were talking about the fact that at the time when Bob Zimmer became president and, at some point, realized I was the only Black trustee there out of 60 trustees.  We were having lunch or breakfast, and I said, “Bob, if every progressive institution like University of Chicago never works with minority-owned companies or asks the majority companies to have minority leaders in their relationship with the university, how do you expect us to create the wealth and stature to qualify to be on the board?” He said, “Every once in a while, someone helps you think about a new way to solve a difficult problem. And so John’s done that for me.”  There’s now over 95 companies that are doing business with the University of Chicago — professional services, financial services, technology, et cetera — that weren’t 11 years ago.  There’s some other institutions in town doing great work like that. Northern Trust NTRS, +1.15%, McDonald’s, Exelon EXC, -0.76% have been absolutely fantastic.  But those are sort of the exceptions, really, that have really made a true commitment. I’m sure there are some others out there, and some others out there nationally. But too often, the economic opportunities are not open for people of color, even today. And, you know, as Dr. [Martin Luther] King said, many well-meaning white Americans deplore prejudice, but accept or ignore economic injustice.  And we continue to see that in our country today.  MarketWatch: What did the Paycheck Protection Program in the CARES Act and the money it distributed to Black-owned businesses show about the wealth gap, and race and business?  Rogers: It was much harder for Black and brown businesses to get access to that vitally needed capital in the heart of the pandemic.  We didn’t have the relationships with the banks. We just did not get the opportunities to save our businesses the way that the majority community did. So I think that’s part of this whole financial-literacy issue; it’s part of this whole relationship. Again, segregation, discrimination. Implicit, unconscious bias is still out there where people think that we’re not worthy of the loans and the opportunities that PPP brought forth.  The second thing that’s really important, and I think it’s not been talked enough about, is the disproportionate amount of Black and brown businesses that are in the parts of the economy where the pandemic hurt them the worst.  If you’re in construction and catering, janitorial services, low-margin businesses to start with, you’re out of business when the pandemic hits. If you’re in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital or lawyers, accountants — they’re able to work from home. Many are doing as well or better, financially, than before the pandemic hit.  And so, again, this historical discrimination of not allowing us in parts of the economy where wealth is being created, that exacerbated and magnified dramatically during this pandemic.  MarketWatch: In the wake of George Floyd’s killing, corporate America pledged a lot of money toward racial justice. How much of that is lip service and PR versus a genuine effort?  Rogers: I think there’s a lot of well-meaning corporations in this case that mean well and start with philanthropy. That’s important, and [Ariel Investments co-CEO and president] Mellody Hobson would say that’s important, but we can’t let that be the end-all and be-all. Because we dream of a day when African-American entrepreneurs can create their own philanthropy, not have to go to white America for all the support.  There’s a lot of pride that comes when we can support our own communities through our own wealth-building activities and our own leadership activities in things that we built, like what happened at Tulsa, where you had a strong Black business community and had strong Black churches, had strong Black philanthropy.  We need to get back to that. It’s a good thing they are doing this, but we can’t allow them to feel like they’ve checked that box; they’re really the good guys now because they’ve given more money this year to historically Black colleges or civil-rights organizations and community organizations.  That’s all good. I mean, that’s great. Most importantly, though, they’ve got to make sure they are hiring people within their own organization at the highest ranks, and they are bringing people of color into the C-suite, into leadership roles, and that they are spending money with minority businesses and minority entrepreneurs and minority business leaders so that we can, again, build our own wealth.  We need access to capital, but we need access to customers. So I always give the example of McDonald’s: Not only do they have over 200 Black-owned franchisees in this country — they’re all multi-millionaires, for the most part, real wealth — they also, over the years, have worked to establish many, many large suppliers to McDonald’s.  If you look at the Black Enterprise list of top 100 companies, when you drill down to the top 20 companies, five of the top Black-owned companies in the country are McDonald’s suppliers. If you have McDonald’s buying anything from croutons to ice-cream toppings to sausages from your business, you’re not going to have any problem getting capital from the banks to build and grow your business. That is the model we would hope that corporate America could follow.  MarketWatch: There’s just so much going in the world right now. How hopeful are you that the wealth gap will close, between improved financial literacy, government intervention, improved hiring practices in the private sector, all these things?  Rogers: I’m more optimistic than I was a year ago. I think it is the silver lining coming out of all this tragedy and the horrific murder of George Floyd and all the challenge we face: I’m finding that more company CEOs seem very sincere about working with Black-owned businesses and getting more Black leadership into their C-suites and into their boards. I’m seeing more non-profits, the anchor institutions in our community, more interested in doing the same thing.  I’m seeing more progressive politicians who understand business getting elected to Congress, getting elected to local offices. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Joyce Beatty (D., Ohio), chairman of the subcommittee on diversity and inclusion, they’re driving change to the institutions that they regulate and oversee.  So for those reasons, I’m optimistic. Corporations seem to be in a better place; business leadership seems to be in a better place. And they are getting pushed along by more progressive political leaders. I think we have hope that this can be something that can be a long-lasting change for our society.		random	John Rogers Jr family's business history	Wanting		‘Diverse perspectives lead to better decision making’: Ariel Investments’ John Rogers Jr. pushes corporate boards to have their own ‘Jackie Robinson moment’
Carel			https://theconversation.com/how-can-french-authorities-prevent-a-terrorist-attack-during-euro-2016-60834	As the UEFA European Championship kicks off in France, the memory of last November’s terrorist attacks on the Stade de France and other venues across Paris looms large. French authorities will be examining the previous attacks – including the January 2015 shootings at Charlie Hebdo – to secure the tournament against any terrorist threat. Even if that means disappointing fans by shutting down Marseilles’ famous beaches.  To start with, authorities will be thinking carefully about what kinds of attacks are possible. Both the Paris and Hebdo attacks were made using small arms. Such attacks are popular with terrorist groups, because they are relatively easy to plan and carry out, can cause a high number of casualties and effectively spread terror throughout the population. It’s very likely that security forces will be preparing for the potential of a similar style of attack.  Authorities will also be wary of potential attacks by suicide bombers, like the one witnessed in Brussels earlier this year. Suicide bomb attacks are frequently used by Islamist-inspired groups, and can be carried out in different ways. Individuals may wear home-made bomb vests, or drive vehicles with explosives into places where many people have gathered.  Of course, bombs can also be planted in specific locations. But static bombs are easier to deal with than suicide bombers, as areas and stadiums can be swept for these devices. What’s more, entrances to stadiums will be tightly controlled, with strict security requirements, similar to the London 2012 Olympics.  Authorities will also be considering how to police more accessible areas like the fan zones and host cities, as these places will attract thousands of supporters on any given day throughout the tournament. France is already on high security alert, having maintained its state of emergency since November, so many of the locations linked to the tournament will be hard for terrorists to penetrate.  Attacks like the ones we’ve witnessed in Europe recently are not easy to carry out – they require planning, and a support network. Of course, this does not stop individuals from launching rogue attacks, like the one at [Leytonstone Tube station](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789) in December 2015.  But while such attacks can cause casualties – as seen in Munich last month – they cannot have the same impact as well-planned, well-resourced attacks. And fans attending the tournament can take comfort from the recent arrest of a French man who was caught transporting weapons, reportedly in order to launch an attack on the tournament.  France is deploying 90,000 police and security personnel to protect citizens. They are likely to be deployed at strategic locations, and no doubt briefed on what to look for. This can include potential terrorist suspects, which intelligence reports have highlighted as possible threats, or keeping an eye out for behaviour that looks out of the ordinary. Security cordons will also be strategically placed to maximise safety and security.  Intelligence will also play a major part in the security operation. On June 7, 2016, Europol – the EU’s law enforcement agency – announced that it was directing 200 of its staff to assist French policing agencies and ensure the rapid exchange of any relevant information.  Contingency plans  The French will also be developing contingency plans, based on which responses worked – and which didn’t – during the Paris and Brussels attacks. Police and emergency services will have carefully planned a series of responses, tailored to the type of attacks that are likely to occur. This will include ensuring the tactics deployed by police firearms units are suitable to address specific threats, and identifying suitable evacuation zones where people can stay safely and the injured can be treated in the event of an attack.  When attending the games themselves, supporters will be encouraged to get to the stadium well ahead of time, as the security procedure will be strict and time consuming. Further security checks on public transport systems such as the Metro are also likely. People should not be overly concerned about the large police presence; officers are there to keep them safe, as well as deal with any violence from rival supporters. The French government has also released a mobile app to alert the public in the event of a terrorist attack.  The threat of a terrorist attack is real. As the Provisional IRA said during the Irish Troubles: the state has to be lucky 100% of the time, the terrorist only once. But when you consider the proportion of attacks which have been prevented, the likelihood of one occurring is still remote.

French authorities will be examining the previous attacks – including the January 2015 shootings at <a href="https://theconversation.com/charlie-hebdo-attack-this-is-not-a-clash-of-civilisations-36030">Charlie Hebdo</a> – to secure the tournament against any terrorist threat. Even if that means disappointing fans by <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/dont-go-into-the-water-chilling-terror-warning-to-england-fans-at-euro-2016-a3267446.html">shutting down Marseilles’ famous beaches</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To start with, authorities will be thinking carefully about what kinds of attacks are possible. Both the Paris and Hebdo attacks were made using small arms. Such attacks are popular with terrorist groups, because they are relatively easy to plan and carry out, can cause a high number of casualties and effectively spread terror throughout the population. It’s very likely that security forces will be preparing for the potential of a similar style of attack.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities will also be wary of potential attacks by suicide bombers, like the one witnessed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-live-updates">in Brussels</a> earlier this year. Suicide bomb attacks are frequently used by Islamist-inspired groups, and can be carried out in different ways. Individuals may wear home-made bomb vests, or drive vehicles with explosives into places where many people have gathered.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, bombs can also be planted in specific locations. But static bombs are easier to deal with than suicide bombers, as areas and stadiums can be swept for these devices. What’s more, entrances to stadiums will be tightly controlled, with strict security requirements, similar to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97983/olympic-safety-security-strategy.pdf">London 2012 Olympics</a>.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/126146/original/image-20160610-29203-n6pv2z.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=535&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px">\n            <figcaption>\n              Security check.\n              <a href="http://www.epa.eu/sports-photos/soccer-photos/feature-paris-photos-52812527">Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</a>\n            </figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Authorities will also be considering how to police more accessible areas like the fan zones and host cities, as these places will attract thousands of supporters on any given day throughout the tournament.

Carel	Financial Action Task Force	Organization	https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2016/dec/us-anti-money-laundering-regulations-201615620.html	U.S. anti-money laundering regulations are well-developed, and domestic coordination to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing is sophisticated and has improved over the past 10 years, according to a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) evaluation issued Thursday.  The FATF is an independent intergovernmental body that promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing.  In the first evaluation of the U.S. regulatory system undertaken by the FATF since 2006, the report states that the U.S. regulatory framework has made “significant progress” since the previous assessment and states that the United States effectively investigates and prosecutes money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FATF’s report also states that under the Bank Secrecy Act, U.S. financial institutions have an evolved understanding of money laundering risks. Financial sectors bear most of the burden in combating money laundering in the United States, and the evaluation found that financial institutions have systems and processes for implementing preventive measures, including onboarding of customers, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious transactions.  The evaluation did note some gaps in U.S. anti-money laundering regulations. FATF guidelines call for member governments to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities and oversight over practicing accountants in firms as well as lawyers, casino operators, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones, and other independent legal professionals.  The United States has not adopted the FATF recommendation to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities over these professions. In the case of the accounting profession, the money-laundering provisions in the Bank Secrecy Act do not separately regulate accountants. But accountants working for financial institutions covered by the Bank Secrecy Act are subject to the anti-money laundering requirements imposed on those entities.  Nonetheless, the FATF cited gaps in U.S. regulations, including:  Minimal coverage of certain institutions and businesses. Minimal measures imposed on certain nonfinancial businesses and professions. The FATF found that casinos are the only one of a number of key sectors in the United States outside of financial services/banking that are required to report suspicious transactions. Professionals who are not subject to sufficient anti-money laundering regulations include accountants, investment advisers, lawyers, real estate agents, and certain trust company and service providers, according to the FATF. Lack of access to adequate, accurate, and current beneficial ownership information. This inability to determine the true owner of a company, such as a shell company, creates opportunities for money launderers to hide illicit proceeds, according to the FATF. Lack of a uniform approach to state-level anti-money laundering efforts. The FATF reported that it is not clear that all states devote enough priority to preventing and detecting money laundering.

[3] [4] In 1975 the Pasechnik family moved to Magadan in the Russian Far East [4] where Pasechnik's father was associated with gold mine operations. [3]  Pasechnik graduated the Donetsk Military-Political College and worked for the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Luhansk Oblast as a chief of a detachment combating contraband operations [4] and the chief of the Stakhanov district detachment. [3] On 15 August 2006 he became famous for intercepting large quantities of contraband at Izvaryne border checkpoint ($1.94 mln and 7.24 mln Russian rubles), at the same time refusing a bribe out of principle. [3] [4]  In March 2007 SBU Lieutenant Colonel Pasechnik received from the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko a medal For Military Service to Ukraine, "for showing integrity and professionalism in the line of duty". [3]  In 2014 he sided with pro-Russian militants, becoming on 9 October 2014 a minister of State Security for the self-proclaimed state Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). [3] [4]  On 21 November 2017, armed men in unmarked uniforms took up positions in the center of Luhansk in what appeared to be a power struggle between the head of the republic Igor Plotnitsky and the (sacked by Plotnitsky) LPR appointed interior minister Igor Kornet. [5] [6] Three days later the website of the separatists stated that Plotnitsky had resigned "for health reasons. Multiple war wounds, the effects of blast injuries, took their toll." [7] The website stated that Pasechnik had been named acting leader "until the next elections." [7] Russian media reported that Plotnitsky had fled the unrecognised republic on 23 November 2017 to Russia. [8] On 25 November the 38-member People's Council of the LPR unanimously approved Plotnitsky's resignation. [9] Pasechnik declared his adherence to the Minsk accords, claiming "The republic will be consistently executing the obligations taken under these agreements." [10] On 30 March 2018 Pasechnik stated "Our [LPR] experience can help all regions of Ukraine eventually gain freedom and independence, and then we can together declare a new Ukraine in which representatives of different nationalities and cultures will freely live." [11] (While meeting people living in territory controlled by LPR in the summer of 2019) Pasechnik stated: "It does not mean, that we will return back into Ukraine. This is the only way to stop this madness, this war. You should understand that we, as a sovereign state will be a state within the state – that will be our special status".

Carel	Larry Scott	Individual	https://www.si.com/college/2020/08/04/pac-12-responds-to-players-threatening-boycott-season	Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott is open to holding dialogue with a group of league football players who are threatening to boycott the 2020 football season, according to a letter that Scott sent the group Monday. Sports Illustrated obtained a copy of the two-page letter, which Scott wrote in response to the #WeAreUnited campaign’s letter Sunday.  Pac-12 officials are reviewing #WeAreUnited’s list of demands and documents, Scott says in the 1,400-word response, sent at 7 p.m. ET Monday. “We are eager to hear more about your concerns and very happy to discuss,” Scott writes. “I will come back to you in the coming days following discussion with our members and student-athlete leaders to schedule a call for this week to discuss the matters that you have raised.”  A Pac-12 spokesman declined comment Monday evening when contacted about the letter.  Sports Illustrated also obtained a copy of the email that #WeAreUnited sent to Scott on Sunday, detailing its demands and requesting “daily” Zoom meetings with Scott, Pac-12 athletic directors and the #WeAreUnited player representative team. The group requested the Zoom meetings begin Monday evening. “We believe a football season under these conditions would be reckless and put us at needless risk,” their email to Scott reads. “The lack of regard for our health and safety is central to the systemic racial injustices imposed by NCAA sports that disproportionately exploits Black athletes physically, academically, and financially.”  The letter was signed by 11 players, each from a different league school. The only program not represented was the University of Colorado. Scott addressed his response to the 11 players: Dallas Hobbs, Washington State; Cody Shear, Arizona State; Jaydon Grant, Oregon State; Valentino Daltoso, Cal; Chase Williams, USC; Elijah Higgins, Stanford; Jevon Holland, Oregon; Joe Tryon, Washington; Malik Hausman, Arizona; Nick Ford, Utah; and Otito Ogbonnia, UCLA.  The health of athletes is the league’s “No. 1 priority,” Scott writes in his letter. “For this reason we have made clear on July 10 that that any student-athlete who chooses not to return to competition for health or safety reasons will have their scholarship protected and will remain in good standing with their team. We support any student-athlete who chooses to opt out for health and safety reasons.”  In regard to many of the players’ demands, Scott cites multiple initiatives that the Pac-12 has championed over the years, including the Pac-12’s policy for (1) providing medical care for athletes four years beyond their eligibility, which is “twice as many years of coverage as any other major conference,” the letter says; (2) allowing any former player to use the remainder of their scholarship to return to campus to complete a degree; (3) against schools canceling scholarships because of poor performance; and (4) to require schools to have mental health services available to all athletes.  The letter also cites the unlimited meals that Pac-12 schools provide their athletes. The league supports two initiatives important to the #WeAreUnited group, Scott's letter states, including a modification of the transfer rule to allow players to play immediately and the passage of a uniform legislation to allow players to profit from their name, image and likeness. No Pac-12 school is requiring athletes to sign a liability waiver to begin workouts, Scott writes in the letter.  He also touches on the Black Lives Matter movement across the country, one that has filtered into college sports. “The Pac-12 has a long history of supporting student-athlete voices and initiatives on social justice,” he writes. “On July 1, the Pac-12 announced a series of next steps to combat racism and support social justice, including (i) a newly-created head of diversity & inclusion position at the Conference, (ii) the formation of a social justice & anti-racism advisory group that includes student-athlete representatives, and (iii) the launch of series of student-athlete & coach anti-racism forums.”	[{'query': {'id': '1605092707580-2bb7ba228894c61a', 'domain': 'si.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.si.com/college/2020/08/04/pac-12-responds-to-players-threatening-boycott-season', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.si.com/college/2020/08/04/pac-12-responds-to-players-threatening-boycott-season', 'author': 'Ross Dellenger', 'headline': 'Pac-12 Commissioner Responds to Football Players Threatening to Boycott 2020 Season', 'mainImage': 'https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NDMzNTk5MjQ2ODM3MDk2/larry-scott-pac12.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': "Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott is open to holding dialogue with a group of league football players who are threatening to boycott the 2020 football season, according to a letter that Scott sent the group Monday.

Carel	Luis Moreno	Individual	http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/US-Embassy-working-with-Jamaica-to-curb-financial-crimes	KINGSTON, Jamaica (JIS) – United States (US) Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno, says the US Mission in Jamaica is working closely with local stakeholders to curb financial crimes and boost regulatory compliance of financial institutions. This is in response to the threat of international correspondent banks cutting ties with local and regional financial institutions in a move to eliminate risk of crimes such as money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing. Moreno, addressing the final day of the fifth Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Conference at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel on Tuesday, said his Mission recognises the critical nature of correspondent banking relationships to the local economy. As such, he said the embassy is seeking to help local partners build capacity, increase transparency and comply with the regulatory framework of the US. “We have mutual interest in fighting the scourge. We are partners in this effort; and together, through more dialogue and action, we can combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism without sacrificing the important correspondent banking relationships,” Moreno said. He noted that the US Embassy has offered training in best practices to law-enforcement, prosecutors and other stakeholders on how to combat financial crimes. They also provide training to investigators at the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) and the Financial Investigations Division (FID) and help in criminal investigations that lead to money-laundering charges. Moreno said the Embassy has also trained regulators in non-financial sectors, such as realtors, accountants and attorneys, as well as professionals from the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission and the Casino Gaming Commission in developing sound practices to ensure risk of money laundering and terrorism financing are understood, identified and reported. “We work with our counterparts, law enforcement and regulatory, to develop and share money-laundering and terrorism-financing methods and trends,” he said. The US Embassy also has an ongoing Jamaica Operations Linked to Telemarketing (JOLT) Task Force designed to facilitate identification, investigation and prosecution of telemarketers who victimise US and Jamaican citizens. “Deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism are a few drivers of de-risking that jurisdictions can address. It is essential that countries and their financial institutions work to improve their controls, and it’s also important that they publicise the efforts in an increasingly risk-averse economic climate,” he said. He said the US Government is working to develop appropriate policy responses to advance the objective of combating financial crimes, while also providing and promoting financial inclusion. Correspondent banking involves a bank in one country facilitating certain services for a financial institution in another country, including wire transfers, business transactions, deposits and gathering of documents. Over the last five years, a number of international banks have restricted or ended their relationship with the region due to concerns about money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing.

Shakshi	Bashar al-Assad	Individual	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/world/europe/trump-sanctions-international-criminal-court.html	Human rights scholars acknowledge that the Trump administration has done well in targeting a number of human rights abusers through economic sanctions.  In 2017, Mr. Trump issued an executive order expanding the authority of the Global Magnitsky Act, passed in 2016, which allows asset freezes and travel bans on human rights abusers. To date during the Trump administration, the government has penalized 214 individuals or entities from 27 countries for human rights atrocities using the act, targeting places like China, Myanmar, Nicaragua and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Human Rights First, an advocacy group, found.  Still, there are glaring omissions. Although the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 17 individuals involved in the premeditated killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia was spared, although U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded that he was likely involved.  Despite the sanctions, Ms. Bensouda’s investigations have not stopped. In March, Ms. Bensouda received approval from the court’s appeals judges to proceed with her inquiry in Afghanistan. Since then, she has accepted a request from government officials there to show, for now, that they can render justice and prosecute potential war criminals on their own. If she is not satisfied with their action, she said she could move forward with her inquiry.  As for the Israeli investigation, she said the conditions to investigate war crimes in Palestinian areas had been met. She is awaiting a ruling from the court’s judges on whether war crimes in the Palestinian areas she wants to investigate are under her territorial jurisdiction.  Even American military leaders have said the Trump administration’s decision to wage war on international institutions like the International Criminal Court will do harm, not just to future sanctions campaigns, but also to the United States’ standing.

Carel	David Asher	Individual	https://www.cuinsight.com/58-red-flags-for-terrorist-financing.html	I recently read an eye-opening report titled Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States by Richard Gordon, an American law professor who served on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Task Force on Terrorism Finance following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The report revealed that suspicious financial transactions could be noted in more than a dozen terrorism-related prosecutions which were analyzed as part of a comprehensive study of terrorism financing for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF). This jarring reality compelled me to share a few highlights from these cases (discussed later in this article) as they explicitly underline how immensely important it is for financial institutions to be diligent and vigilant in their monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity.  This sentiment was very strongly voiced by the Director of FinCEN last month in a speech which focused on terrorist financing and the important fact that BSA reports filed by financial institutions can identify suspicious activity which may ultimately prove to be related to the funding of terrorism. This stance was also endorsed by renowned counter-terrorism expert Richard Barrett at a congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing last week. Mr. Barrett testified that “Suspicious Activity Reports filed by financial institutions may provide possible indicators of terrorist planning worthy of investigation”. I have included some brief snippets from these commentaries and others below.  Finally, I’ve concluded this article with 58 red flag indicators for terrorist financing from four different sources. I opted to provide readers with the original lists as compiled by these sources rather than remove redundant indicators and consolidate into a single list since the nuances of the different wording provides more detail or specifics in some cases for the noted indicators.  Director of FinCEN shares that 18% of the FBI’s international terrorism cases in 2014 had related BSA filings and urges financial institutions’ “continued vigilance and support.”  A few weeks ago, the Director of FinCEN, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, made terrorist financing the theme of her speech at an anti-money laundering seminar for bankers. Director Calvery informed the attendees that “The reporting your institutions provide has already proven to be an essential component in identifying foreign terrorist fighters, their financial facilitators, and the flow of funds” and she urged financial institutions’ continued vigilance and support. She provided statistics that FinCEN processes about 50,000 new filings each day and that automated business rules related to ISIL, alone, generate over 800 matches each month for further review and exploitation. She added that “Foreign terrorist fighters may use an ATM, a money services business (MSB), or a depository institution to send or receive funds to facilitate travel to Iraq and Syria”. Director Calvery stressed that “there is no doubt at FinCEN, or amongst our partners across government, that the reporting your financial institutions provide is essential to our efforts to disrupt, degrade, and ultimately defeat al-Qa’ida, ISIL and other terrorist groups”. As Juan Zarate, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism so aptly put it – “Money is their [terrorist groups] enabler, but it’s also their Achilles’ heel.”  Sample Case Highlights – Credit Card Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud and Money Laundering Structuring  One noteworthy case in the above mentioned report Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States involved two small businesses – a deli and an ice cream shop. The case highlighted 12 feeder accounts held at multiple U.S. banks. Money was deposited into the feeder accounts by various means, including check deposits, cash deposits, and wire transfers. Bank records for the 12 feeder accounts revealed 3,252 cash deposits. The deposits were structured to avoid reporting requirements. Only one of them was a cash deposit for more than $10,000 triggering a reporting requirement. However, on each of several hundred days, an aggregate of more than $10,000 was deposited into the feeder accounts. The ice cream shop also operated as an unlicensed and unregistered money transmitter and over an eight year period, $22.1 million was deposited into the feeder accounts even though the small shop only had annual revenue of about $185,000. The funds were subsequently consolidated into a central account in the U.S. using checks and wire transfers from the 12 accounts; and $21.9 million was wired from the central account on behalf of customers in the U.S. to accounts in 25 countries, ultimately making its way back to Yemen. The recipient operators who controlled the accounts in those countries exchanged the funds into local currency and distributed payments to the intended beneficiaries. Evidence showed that the money transfers were tied to funding for al-Qaeda and Hamas. This case clearly illustrates that terrorist financers often uses classic money laundering typologies regardless of whether they are trying to launder the proceeds of crime. The study concluded that “by using standard anti-money laundering typologies financial institutions should have been able to identify fourteen instances of terrorism financing as being suspicious”, even though the FI might not see on the face of it that the suspicious activity was in fact linked to terrorism financing.  Other terrorist financing cases have involved bank fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, identity fraud and a host of criminal activities which we typically consider much less grave than the funding of terrorism. The FBI has indicated that numerous terrorist investigations have resulted from financial information provided by the financial sector and that is has assisted with connecting the dots.  “Terrorism Financing Version 2.0” – Counter-terrorism Experts Highlight A Dangerous Union: The Intersection of Terrorism and Organized Crime  A distinguished panel of witnesses all emphasized one dominant trend at last week’s congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing – terrorists increasingly are turning to crime and criminal networks for funding. Chairman Mike Fitzpatrick commented in his opening remarks that “Terrorist groups have become entwined with trans-national criminal syndicates – or in some cases evolving into the role themselves – engaging in criminal activities which yield greater profits than simply relying on state sponsorship or big pocket donors.” Expert after expert witness confirmed that shared view. The words in their testimonies were different but their message was the same. As terrorist groups have become larger and more organized and have sought to raise more money, they have been forced into closer cooperation with organized criminals and have copied some of their methods. Although terrorists continue to raise money through “legal” means such as collecting funds from witting or unwitting donors through established charities or by direct donation, David Asher, Board of Advisors Member for The Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance referred to the emergence of a trend which he termed “Terrorism Financing Version 2.0”. Mr. Asher elaborated that “Version 2.0 represents a vast evolution above and beyond the traditional religious charities, mosques, and jihadi financiers and involves a substantial embrace of transnational organized crime.” As illicit finance expert Douglas Farah succinctly summarized – “The TOC [Transnational Organized Crime] / terrorism divide is increasingly disappearing.”  In some cases, terrorist groups primarily pursue criminal activities for fundraising purposes. According to the DEA, 22 of 59 Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2014 were linked to drug trafficking. The DEA, the FBI, and the intelligence community have focused more and more attention on the nexus between drugs and terror and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has merged its international drug and foreign terrorism sections because of the intimate link between the two. Juan Zarate who testified before the Task Force last month, stated that “America’s enemies – drug trafficking cartels, organized crime groups, militant groups, and terrorists – are finding each other, as a matter of convenience and opportunity.” Mr. Zarate emphasized that “the overlaps between the criminal underworld, illicit financial activity, and terrorist operations and funding will continue to evolve as marriages of convenience emerge in common areas of operation”.  click here.

transactions.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>I recently read an eye-opening report titled\xa0<em>Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States</em>\xa0by Richard Gordon, an American law professor who served on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Task Force on Terrorism Finance following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The report revealed that suspicious financial transactions could be noted in more than a dozen terrorism-related prosecutions which were analyzed as part of a comprehensive study of terrorism financing for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF). This jarring reality compelled me to share a few highlights from these cases (discussed later in this article) as they explicitly underline how immensely important it is for financial institutions to be diligent and vigilant in their monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity.</p>\n\n<p>This sentiment was very strongly voiced by the Director of FinCEN last month in a speech which focused on terrorist financing and the important fact that BSA reports filed by financial institutions can identify suspicious activity which may ultimately prove to be related to the funding of terrorism. This stance was also endorsed by renowned counter-terrorism expert Richard Barrett at a congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing last week. Mr. Barrett testified that “Suspicious Activity Reports filed by financial institutions may provide possible indicators of terrorist planning worthy of investigation”. I have included some brief snippets from these commentaries and others below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, I’ve concluded this article with 58 red flag indicators for terrorist financing from four different sources.</strong>\xa0I opted to provide readers with the original lists as compiled by these sources rather than remove redundant indicators and consolidate into a single list since the nuances of the different wording provides more detail or specifics in some cases for the noted indicators.</p>\n\n<p>Director of FinCEN shares that 18% of the FBI’s international terrorism cases in 2014 had related BSA filings and urges financial institutions’ “continued vigilance and support.”</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, the Director of FinCEN, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, made terrorist financing the theme of her speech at an anti-money laundering seminar for bankers. Director Calvery informed the attendees that “The reporting your institutions provide has already proven to be an essential component in identifying foreign terrorist fighters, their financial facilitators, and the flow of funds” and she urged financial institutions’ continued vigilance and support. She provided statistics that FinCEN processes about 50,000 new filings each day and that automated business rules related to ISIL, alone, generate over 800 matches each month for further review and exploitation. She added that “Foreign terrorist fighters may use an ATM, a money services business (MSB), or a depository institution to send or receive funds to facilitate travel to Iraq and Syria”. Director Calvery stressed that “there is no doubt at FinCEN, or amongst our partners across government, that the reporting your financial institutions provide is essential to our efforts to disrupt, degrade, and ultimately defeat al-Qa’ida, ISIL and other terrorist groups”. As Juan Zarate, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism so aptly put it –\xa0<strong>“Money is their [terrorist groups] enabler, but it’s also their Achilles’ heel.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sample Case Highlights – Credit Card Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud and Money Laundering Structuring</p>\n\n<p>One noteworthy case in the above mentioned report\xa0<em>Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States</em>\xa0involved two small businesses – a deli and an ice cream shop. The case highlighted 12 feeder accounts held at multiple U.S. banks. Money was deposited into the feeder accounts by various means, including check deposits, cash deposits, and wire transfers. Bank records for the 12 feeder accounts revealed 3,252 cash deposits. The deposits were structured to avoid reporting requirements. Only one of them was a cash deposit for more than $10,000 triggering a reporting requirement. However, on each of several hundred days, an aggregate of more than $10,000 was deposited into the feeder accounts. The ice cream shop also operated as an unlicensed and unregistered money transmitter and over an eight year period, $22.1 million was deposited into the feeder accounts even though the small shop only had annual revenue of about $185,000. The funds were subsequently consolidated into a central account in the U.S. using checks and wire transfers from the 12 accounts; and $21.9 million was wired from the central account on behalf of customers in the U.S. to accounts in 25 countries, ultimately making its way back to Yemen. The recipient operators who controlled the accounts in those countries exchanged the funds into local currency and distributed payments to the intended beneficiaries. Evidence showed that the money transfers were tied to funding for al-Qaeda and Hamas. This case clearly illustrates that terrorist financers often uses classic money laundering typologies regardless of whether they are trying to launder the proceeds of crime. The study concluded that “by using standard anti-money laundering typologies financial institutions should have been able to identify fourteen instances of terrorism financing as being suspicious”, even though the FI might not see on the face of it that the suspicious activity was in fact linked to terrorism financing.</p>\n\n<p>Other terrorist financing cases have involved bank fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, identity fraud and a host of criminal activities which we typically consider much less grave than the funding of terrorism. The FBI has indicated that numerous terrorist investigations have resulted from financial information provided by the financial sector and that is has assisted with connecting the dots.</p>\n\n<p>“Terrorism Financing Version 2.0” – Counter-terrorism Experts Highlight A Dangerous Union: The Intersection of Terrorism and Organized Crime</p>\n\n<p>A distinguished panel of witnesses all emphasized one dominant trend at last week’s congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing – terrorists increasingly are turning to crime and criminal networks for funding. Chairman Mike Fitzpatrick commented in his opening remarks that “Terrorist groups have become entwined with trans-national criminal syndicates – or in some cases evolving into the role themselves – engaging in criminal activities which yield greater profits than simply relying on state sponsorship or big pocket donors.” Expert after expert witness confirmed that shared view. The words in their testimonies were different but their message was the same. As terrorist groups have become larger and more organized and have sought to raise more money, they have been forced into closer cooperation with organized criminals and have copied some of their methods. Although terrorists continue to raise money through “legal” means such as collecting funds from witting or unwitting donors through established charities or by direct donation, David Asher, Board of Advisors Member for The Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance referred to the emergence of a trend which he termed “Terrorism Financing Version 2.0”. Mr. Asher elaborated that “Version 2.0 represents a vast evolution above and beyond the traditional religious charities, mosques, and jihadi financiers and involves a substantial embrace of transnational organized crime.” As illicit finance expert Douglas Farah succinctly summarized –\xa0<strong>“The TOC [Transnational Organized Crime] / terrorism divide is increasingly disappearing.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>In some cases, terrorist groups primarily pursue criminal activities for fundraising purposes. According to the DEA, 22 of 59 Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2014 were linked to drug trafficking. The DEA, the FBI, and the intelligence community have focused more and more attention on the nexus between drugs and terror and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has merged its international drug and foreign terrorism sections because of the intimate link between the two. Juan Zarate who testified before the Task Force last month, stated that “America’s enemies – drug trafficking cartels, organized crime groups, militant groups, and terrorists – are finding each other, as a matter of convenience and opportunity.” Mr. Zarate emphasized that “the overlaps between the criminal underworld, illicit financial activity, and terrorist operations and funding will continue to evolve as marriages of convenience emerge in common areas of operation”.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://info.verafin.com/58-Red-Flags-for-Terrorist-Financing-CUNA.html">click here</a>.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2016-01-14T11:53:33+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': 'January 14, 2016'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	Some indicators and examples for terrorist financing	Wanting		58 red flags for terrorist financing
Carel	Merchant Risk Council	Organization	https://www.rtinsights.com/online-payments-fraud-detection-machine-leaning/	Fraud detection with machine learning requires large datasets to train a model, weighted variables, and human review only as a last defense.  With advances in computer technology and ecommerce also comes increased vulnerability to fraud. Hackers are continuously finding new ways to target undeserving victims, from stolen credit card details to false accounts. Any business or individual who uses online payment sources is open to fraud.  In 2015, financial fraud — including payment cards, remote banking and cheques — rose a staggering 26 percent from the previous year, totaling a cost of £755 million. It was the fourth consecutive year that has seen an increase in this area. It is the most common crime in the UK, with 2.47 million offenses reported in 2015-2016 alone. The multi-million pound cost of fraud is proving detrimental to online businesses who foot a high proportion of the bill in chargebacks.  In 2015 all fraud types had risen with much owed to the growth of impersonation and deception scams, as well as sophisticated online attacks such as malware and data breaches.  Why transaction rules aren’t enough  The traditional approach to tackling this problem is to use rules or logic statements to query transactions and to direct suspicious transactions through to human review. While there is some variation, it is notable that over 90 percent of online fraud detection platforms still use this method, including platforms used by banks and payment gateways. While this is effective to some degree, in cases where there is a sufficient gap between an order being received and goods being shipped, it is also incredibly costly and far slower than alternatives.  The “rules” in these platform use a combination of data, horizon-scanning and gut-feel. The system is backed with manual reviews to confirm experts’ decisions. If we take the recent reports of an abundance of Turkish credit cards available on the darknet due to the publicized data breach in Turkey: businesses recognize the increased risk of Turkish cards as fraudulent and can simply add a rule to review any transactions from Turkish credit cards  Following this, every attempted purchase made by such a card raises an alert and is declined or reviewed. However, this raises two significant issues. The first is that such a generalized rule may turn away millions of legitimate customers, ultimately losing the business money and jeopardizing customer relations. Secondly, while this can deter future threats after such fraud has been found, it fails to identify or predict potential threats that businesses are not aware of.  These rules tend to produce binary results, deeming transactions as either good or bad and failing to consider anything in between. And until the rules are manually reviewed, the system will continue to prevent such transactions as those from Turkish credit cards, even if the risk or threat is no longer prominent.  When human review fails  Criminal gangs also use malware and phishing emails as a means to compromise customers’ security and personal details. Once obtained, fraudsters will use these details to access customer accounts or to commit fraud. These methods all aim to compromise customers’ personal and financial details, including card data, in order to enable the criminals to commit fraud. Here, the card data used is legitimate but is not being used under the consent of the owner. In these cases, such rules would fail to block transactions.  According to the 2015 Merchant Risk Council (MRC) Global Fraud Survey, merchants typically manually review 10-15 percent of online orders. Other reports suggest that as many as 26 percent of ecommerce orders are manually reviewed. This is prime example of how human endeavor is failing to use and enhance computing efficiency.  Machine learning for fraud detection  Machine learning has been recognized as a successful measure for fraud detection. A great deal of data is transferred during online transaction processes, resulting in a binary result: genuine or fraudulent. Online businesses are able to identify fraudulent transactions accurately because they receive chargebacks on them. However, this happens after the transaction has been processed and therefore is reactive, not proactive.  Machine learning works on the basis of large, historical datasets that have been created using a collection of data across many clients and industries. Even companies that only process a relatively small number of transactions are able to take full advantage of the data sets for their vertical, allowing them to get accurate decisions on each transaction. This aggregation of data provides a highly accurate set of training data, and the access to this information allows businesses to choose the right model to optimize the levels of recall and precision that they provide: out of all the transactions the model predicts to be fraudulent (recall), what proportion of these actually are (precision)?  Once the accuracy of the models is deemed acceptable it is time to start predicting, but where do such predictions come from?  Within the datasets, features are constructed. These are data points such as the age and value of the customer account, as well as the origin of the credit card. There can be hundreds of features and each contributes, to varying extents, towards the fraud probability. Note, the degree in which each feature contributes to the fraud score is not determined by a fraud analyst, but is generated by the artificial intelligence of the machine which is driven by the training set. So, in regards to the Turkish card fraud, if the use of Turkish cards to commit fraud is proven to be high, the fraud weighting of a transaction that uses a Turkish credit card will be equally so. However, if this were to diminish, the contribution level would parallel. Simply put, these models self-learn without explicit programming such as with manual review.  Such features in machine learning-based systems make it possible for fraud analysts to identify the most significant contributors. Feedback from users to confirm the system’s decisions by marking customers as genuine or fraudster improves the machine’s learning ability, adding to accuracy.  Three steps to predict fraud using machine learning  Extract features from a dataset. Provide training set. Build models.  In questioning the practicality of building the models, note that models can be reused from similar data. Example: A model used for one retail ecommerce site will also work for another, albeit with minor adjustments of features, thus meaning the implementation of such a model is relatively quick.  Merchants who use such systems are continuously assessing customers for fraud, recalculating a score with every action that occurs on their website or app. If an action is deemed to breach the fraud probability threshold, the transaction will be blocked.  In order to lessen, and hopefully defeat, the onslaught of fraud, businesses must improve the accuracy and speed of their decisions on fraudulent threats. The only mature technology available to achieve this is machine learning. Manual review is most effective as the last defense against fraud: While it can be invaluable, particularly in cases where there is no substitute for human insight, manual review works best to help fine-tune machine learning models decisions and aid their detection of changing patterns of fraud, rather than being the sole fraud detection process. Information from detected fraud threats needs to be used to enhance the next generation of automated fraud prevention, rather than replace it.

Hackers are continuously finding new ways to target undeserving victims, from stolen credit card details to false accounts. Any business or individual who uses online payment sources is open to fraud.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, financial fraud — including payment cards, remote banking and cheques — rose a staggering 26 percent from the previous year, totaling a cost of £755 million. It was the fourth consecutive year that has seen an increase in this area.\xa0 It is the most common crime in the UK, with 2.47 million offenses reported in 2015-2016 alone. The multi-million pound cost of fraud \xa0is proving detrimental to online businesses who foot a high proportion of the bill in chargebacks.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015 all fraud types had risen with much owed to the growth of impersonation and deception scams, as well as sophisticated online attacks such as malware and data breaches.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why transaction rules aren’t enough</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The traditional approach to tackling this problem is to use rules or logic statements to query transactions and to direct suspicious transactions through to human review. While there is some variation, it is notable that over 90 percent of online fraud detection platforms still use this method, including platforms used by banks and payment gateways. While this is effective to some degree, in cases where there is a sufficient gap between an order being received and goods being shipped, it is also incredibly costly and far slower than alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The “rules” in these platform use a combination of data, horizon-scanning and gut-feel. The system is backed with manual reviews to confirm experts’ decisions. If we take the recent reports of an abundance of Turkish credit cards available on the <a title="darknet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">darknet </a>due to the publicized data breach in Turkey: businesses recognize the increased risk of Turkish cards as fraudulent and can simply add a rule to review any transactions from Turkish credit cards</p>\n\n<p>Following this, every attempted purchase made by such a card raises an alert and is declined or reviewed. However, this raises two significant issues. The first is that such a generalized rule may turn away millions of legitimate customers, ultimately losing the business money and jeopardizing customer relations. Secondly, while this can deter future threats after such fraud has been found, it fails to identify or predict potential threats that businesses are not aware of.</p>\n\n<p>These rules tend to produce binary results, deeming transactions as either good or bad and failing to consider anything in between. And until the rules are manually reviewed, the system will continue to prevent such transactions as those from Turkish credit cards, even if the risk or threat is no longer prominent.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>When human review fails</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs also use malware and <a title="phishing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing </a>emails as a means to compromise customers’ security and personal details. Once obtained, fraudsters will use these details to access customer accounts or to commit fraud. These methods all aim to compromise customers’ personal and financial details, including card data, in order to enable the criminals to commit fraud. Here, the card data used is legitimate but is not being used under the consent of the owner. In these cases, such rules would fail to block transactions.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href="https://www.merchantriskcouncil.org/resource-center/surveys/2015/2015-mrc-global-fraud-survey">2015 Merchant Risk Council (MRC) Global Fraud Survey</a>, merchants typically manually review 10-15 percent of online orders. Other reports suggest that as many as 26 percent of ecommerce orders are manually reviewed. This is prime example of how human endeavor is failing to use and enhance computing efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2><strong><a href="https://532386f9a72d1dd857a8-41058da2837557ec5bfc3b00e1f6cf43.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Depositphotos_122267850_s-2015-e1477115403220.jpg"><img src="https://532386f9a72d1dd857a8-41058da2837557ec5bfc3b00e1f6cf43.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Depositphotos_122267850_s-2015-300x225.jpg" alt="fraud detection machine learning"></a>Machine learning for fraud detection </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Machine learning has been recognized as a successful measure for fraud detection.

Carel	Jim Lee	Individual	https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/10/24/pennsylvania_pollster_jim_lee_there_is_definitely_a_submerged_trump_vote.html	Jim Lee, a pollster with Susquehanna Polling and Research, told the WFMZ "Business Matters" panel last week why he believes there is a "submerged" Trump vote that polls are not registering.  LANNELLI: Good evening, we are talking election 2020, it is a crazy year across the board. Jim Lee, polling right now, I don't want to say all over the place, but first and foremost, many people want to say it's not legitimate. It doesn't work, particularly on the trump side, six or seven points hidden numbers. Your thoughts on where we are in the polling? LEE: There is definitely a submerged Trump vote. Polling can be an art, it can be a science. When pollsters get the results back and they look suspicious because one candidate has a double digit lead carried by one candidate by a point or two, they should realize something is not right and that is where the art of the polling comes in. I would like to talk about the disparities, 2016 and where we are today. LANNELLI: Chris, you are everywhere, you are on my show. That's how far you have come. BORICK: I've made it, Tony. LANNELLI: Do you get the suspicion, he's a Biden guy or a Trump guy? BORICK: From both sides, if people don't like where their results are, they are going to complain. A lot of it is motivated reason, if you wanted to see a number that you hope for and it’s not there you are going to complain. That's why we are an evidence-based thing. Look at the final results, you can see the records of pollsters. LANNELLI: It is legitimate for those that say 10 or 11 points 2016, explain that, I guess. BORICK: Look at the final, the aggregate results 2016. Pennsylvania, the average before the election was two points in favor of Hillary Clinton, president won by less than one point. A little bit off. Those polls were closing. You saw the national polls. Here's the story that people don't look at, national polls average two points -- three points for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She won the popular vote by two points, they were closer than they were in 2012. LANNELLI: You think the double digits trump is behind are legitimate? BORICK: I don't know if it's ten, but it is significant. LANNELLI: Do you agree? LEE: Absolutely not. Trump has a dead heat in Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina released today, statistical dead heat. Speaking of polling in 2016, I’m embarrassed by some of the firms releasing polling three days before the 2016 election. Our friends in Lancaster showing Clinton with an 11-point lead. Talk about voter suppression, you talk about the average lead. Here’s the numbers in 2016, on October 10, 2016, the average RealClearPolitics lead, Wisconsin- Clinton, 6.8%. Actual, Trump by a point. average lead for Clinton 8.6%. Garbage polling. I’m telling you there is a standard for polling has become lax. I was one of the few polling firms take on the Patriot news in Harrisburg and call out egregious polling by academic liberal institutions missing the mark with polling and in fact, the RealClear average today is seven points for Biden and the race is a statistical tie according to our polls. I think they owe the state of Pennsylvania an apology. LANNELLI: are you entertained by that? BORICK: Jim's twisting it. the Franklin and Marshal poll was off that year. I would look over the history of the polls, including your polls. we have been off on elections. We are transparent as can be, part of polling is taking a small sample and making inference about big samples. You statistically sometimes miss. There are method logical reasons for it. Look at how they perform look at them at all there races. LANNELLI: As of now, the numbers are the numbers. Hard to tell with the margin of error kind of thing?

I get the sense that you are mad about something. \n\nLEE: I am. Polls that come out days before an election that are egregiously off -- \n\nLANNELLI: Do they affect the vote? \n\nLEE: We\'ll never know the answer to that. When a poll comes out with one candidate, in this case Hillary Clinton, winning by 11 points when the winner of the race is the other candidate, that is not an outlier, that is bad polling and makes our industry look bad. I called on the American Associated of Opinion Research to crackdown on egregious polling for firms that don\'t understand the landscape of Pennsylvania and that guys like Chris and I trying to do quality work, Chris\' last poll in 2016 was in the margin of error. Ours showed the race a statistical tie. When others had the race at 11 points. Do you think that\'s voter suppression? I\'m sticking up for the industry, we need to crackdown, someone needs to say this is out of control. \n\nLANNELLI: Chris, I never sense you have an agenda. is that hard to do, by the way? you have to be very neutral to make the numbers clear and accurate. \n\nBORICK: I always say to people attacked from the left to the right. I\'ll put a number out. you will see on election day how it performs. we have a slight Republican lean in our result. not because I\'m a Republican or Democrat, but how we polled. you have to be transparent and show how you do it, how you proceed, and then people will attack you for almost anything they want. \n\nLANNELLI: A lot of the pro-Trump crowd is saying, don\'t forget there are 6 to 7 -- 10 points in there, we\'ve got this thing. There is nervousness, obviously. That\'s not there? \n\nBORICK: If I was a supporter of the president and banking on -- they could move closer like 2016. you get averages or couple of points. \n\nLANNELLI: Are you surprised how much points can move in a day or two in an election? \n\nBORICK: Not if there is big movement. They have not moved as much as we might give them credit for this fall. They have moved. \n\nLANNELLI: the numbers are the numbers. if you think there are 7-10 points in there, I think you are dreaming. \n\nBORICK: I agree. \n\nLEE: I disagree. the polls are not moving. we have the race in Pennsylvania two points in the September poll and other firms showing a margin of error that the race is tied, tied all along in our estimation. \n\nLANNELLI: do you think truly tied or five or six points that you hear about, people say are out there are for real? I hear it all the time. the Trumpers are not going to tell people -- \n\nLEE: The president is out there with the narrative that you shouldn\'t do polling. there are a lot of pollers that don\'t want to admit they are voting for a guy that has been called a racist. that submerged trump factor is real. We have been able to capture it and others have not. 2016 in the summer and early fall showed Pennsylvania up for grabs. Other firms are putting out leads for Hillary Clinton in double digits.

Polling can be an art, it can be a science. When pollsters get the results back and they look suspicious because one candidate has a double digit lead carried by one candidate by a point or two, they should realize something is not right and that is where the art of the polling comes in.

A lot of it is motivated reason, if you wanted to see a number that you hope for and it’s not there you are going to complain. That\'s why we are an evidence-based thing. Look at the final results, you can see the records of pollsters. <br>\n<br>\nLANNELLI: It is legitimate for those that say 10 or 11 points 2016, explain that, I guess. <br>\n<br>\nBORICK: Look at the final, the aggregate results 2016. Pennsylvania, the average before the election was two points in favor of Hillary Clinton, president won by less than one point. A little bit off. Those polls were closing. You saw the national polls. Here\'s the story that people don\'t look at, national polls average two points -- three points for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She won the popular vote by two points, they were closer than they were in 2012. <br>\n<br>\nLANNELLI: You think the double digits trump is behind are legitimate? <br>\n<br>\nBORICK: I don\'t know if it\'s ten, but it is significant. <br>\n<br>\nLANNELLI: Do you agree? <br>\n<br>\nLEE: Absolutely not. Trump has a dead heat in Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina released today, statistical dead heat.

Carel	Vijaya Ramachandran	Individual	https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/18/9756004/terrorism-derisking-banks-remittances	One of the most significant, but least covered, parts of the war on terror has been the Treasury Department's effort to shut down al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups' access to financial institutions. It's an attractive way of tackling the problem: Freezing accounts here isn't as expensive as sending in troops or airstrikes, and no civilians get hurt.  Except the second part might not be true. A report released last week by the Center for Global Development, authored by a working group chaired by visiting fellow Clay Lowery and senior fellow Vijaya Ramachandran, argues that laws meant to counteract money laundering and terrorism financing are encouraging broader "derisking," in which Western banks cut off ties with financial institutions in the developing world so as to reduce the odds that they'll run afoul of regulations. The result is that developing-world banks, money transfer organizations (which handle remittances), and nonprofit organizations are losing access to the financial system as a whole.  That can have real human consequences. People in countries like Somalia or Nigeria who rely on remittances from relatives in rich countries like the US could see fewer transfers or higher fees. NGOs doing health programs or cash transfers could see programs scaled back due to lack of banking. Foreign investment in developing countries could decrease due to fewer big international banks dealing in those countries.  These concerns aren't just hypothetical. A 2013 survey by CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) found that 70 percent of remittance-handling companies in Australia either had accounts closed or had been threatened with closure. Barclay's is estimated to have closed accounts for more than 140 British remittance companies. Remittances alone totaled nearly $600 billion last year, more than double all official foreign aid, and bank moves like these seriously jeopardize those flows. And that's not even considering the effects on developing country banks and NGOs. "Even the large NGOs trying to do cash programs are having trouble getting a bank account," Ramachandran told me.  The rules are longstanding. But the enforcement has ramped up.  The US federal government has been fighting money laundering for decades, dating back at least to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. And since 1990, rich nations have coordinated their policy response to the problem through a group called the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). FATF has generally advocated a "risk-based approach" to money laundering enforcement. With customers and activities unlikely to be engaged in laundering, authorities can use less invasive, simpler enforcement methods. But for customers and activities judged at high risk, enforcement gets more resource-intensive and intricate.  This works pretty well for ordinary money laundering, since you can identify low-risk customers just by seeing who doesn't have very much money in the bank. A checking account with $17 in it doesn't really need to be closely analyzed for laundering behavior. But it's much trickier when you're trying to combat terrorism financing. Even though some suspected terrorism financiers will be on sanctions lists, there's doubtless some financing happening through individuals and organizations that aren't on law enforcement or intelligence agencies' radars. That means financial regulators have to look at the whole pool. And they can't necessarily rule out accounts or transactions involving small amounts: As the CGD report quotes FATF advising, "Transactions associated with the financing of terrorists may be conducted in very small amounts, which in applying a risk-based approach could be the very transactions that are frequently considered to be of minimal risk with regard to money laundering."  What's more, after 9/11, enforcement by US authorities ramped up, with the total number of fines issued spiking:  (CGD)  And the total value of fines has grown in recent years from trivial levels into the billions:  (CGD)  The financial sector responded to this uptick in enforcement by "withdrawing wholesale from types of activities or business sectors that are seen to be riskier," Lowery and Ramachandran write.  This process is known as "derisking," and it's had a serious impact on the developing world, especially in countries judged to be high risk for terrorism financing. Numerous companies are pulling out of the remittance business, which puts people receiving remittances in poor countries at risk of serious financial hardship. International banks are showing wariness of dealing with banks in "high-risk countries," which could hurt investment and endanger the livelihoods of people there. And, perhaps predictably, nonprofits judged to be overly "Islamic" are getting targeted, regardless of the humanitarian work they do.  Here are just a few of the indicators Lowery and Ramachandran compiled showing developed country banks curbing their relationships with remittance companies, developing country banks, and NGOs working in the developing world:  In the US, Sunrise Community Bank and Merchants Bank of California closed all Somali remittance accounts. Merchants had been responsible for 80 percent of remittances to Somalia. In the UK, HSBC pulled out of the remittance sector entirely. A report from the British Bankers association found that counter-party relationships between "high-risk" countries and international clearinghouses fell by 6 percent from 2012 to 2014. A 2014 poll of banks found that more than 40 percent of respondents cited money laundering regulations as a "very significant" impediment to trade in Africa. Reports from both the World Bank and the Norwegian Refugee Council documented banks admitting in correspondence that they will not transfer funds to nonprofits they perceive to be "Islamic."  And following the CGD report, the undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, reported results from a World Bank survey of financial institutions suggesting that this derisking process was making it meaningfully more expensive to do business in the developing world. "Three-quarters of the large banks indicated that they had reduced the number of their correspondent accounts in recent years," Sheets said in a speech at CGD. "On the respondent side, a majority of local and regional banks reported a decline in the number of their correspondent accounts, with [remittance businesses] and small clients particularly affected. The vast majority of affected banks reported that they were able to find replacements, though often at a higher cost."  The good news: People in power are aware of the problem  The solution here, Ramachandran told me, will likely take the form of better, subtler enforcement rather than huge changes in the legal framework. "The big picture is that these rules have to be implemented better, in a smarter way than what's happening now," she says. "What we're arguing is that we need better implementation of the risk-based approach. They should be able to address risk on a case-by-case basis rather labeling entire entities as high risk."  Case-by-case enforcement means that innocent people in "high-risk" countries like Somalia will take less of a hit, but it could also mean that the counterterrorism goals of the enforcement regime are easier to meet. The fewer transparent mechanisms for transferring money to poor countries, like remittance services, there are, the more people start to turn to less traceable methods, like just transferring cash in suitcases (as reportedly has been happening in Somalia). "What we're seeing is that money is beginning to flow through less transparent mechanisms," Ramachandran says. "This is not what we want, from either a development perspective or a security perspective."  Luckily, key stakeholders are recognizing that this is a concern. The fact that a senior Treasury official like Sheets appeared at the CGD event unveiling the new report, and provided data confirming the scale of the problem, was itself a significant good omen. FATF, the international anti–money laundering coordinating body, has warned financial institutions against wholesale derisking. "The FATF Recommendations only require financial institutions to terminate customer relationships, on a case-by-case basis, where the money laundering and terrorist financing risks cannot be mitigated," the group said in a statement. "What is not in line with the FATF standards is the wholesale cutting loose of entire classes of customer."  A significant faction in Congress has also begun to champion the issue and pressure US authorities for better enforcement. In February, three senators and nine members of the House wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and other major executive branch policymakers warning of decreasing remittance options for Somali Americans, saying a solution is required to "protect our national security and avoid exacerbating a humanitarian crisis." Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) — whose state has a significant Somali refugee population — brought up the issue during Yellen's February testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, and Yellen conceded derisking was "causing a great deal of hardship."  The problem is hardly solved — but unlike plenty of other policy areas, there at least seems to be some interest in Washington in addressing it.  Will you help keep Vox free for all?

DC's Publisher/Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee confirmed the long-rumored reboot of DC's comic book line is no more.As Newsarama reports, Lee revealed the news during prerecorded Q&A segment at DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse. Lee confirmed DC won't be publishing a comic or event called 5G, nor are there plans to perform a sweeping overhaul of DC's continuity a la 2011's New 52 relaunch. Instead, DC will take a character-driven approach to its comic book lineup, as the company shifts focus in the wake of major layoffs and editorial restructuring."There won't be a project called '5G', or a big reboot, or whatever," Lee said. "We really want to focus on individual titles, and organically build up individual characters over the course of the next year.""We had a lot of great ideas that we were floating around," Lee continued. "And rather than dumping it all in one month and renumbering the line and going for that really short-term spike in sales, we just naturally gravitated to the story ideas and concepts we love and building them into the mythology - the ongoing mythology - in a very organic way."  While DC has never been clear on what exactly 5G was, it was rumored to be an ambitious reboot built around the fallout of Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock and the creation of a new, unified DC Universe timeline. Former Co-Publisher Dan DiDio had revealed glimpses of that detailed timeline in 2019, which organized DC's entire, 80-year publishing history into four distinct generations, beginning with Wonder Woman's public debut (Generation 1) and spanning until the present (Generation 4). 5G was reportedly the start of Generation 5, with traditional heroes like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne aging out of their roles and a younger generation of heroes rising up to take their place.  However, between DiDio's surprise departure from DC and the quiet cancellation of DC's Free Comic Book Day 2020 release, Generation Zero, all signs have pointed to DC pivoting away from its 5G plans in 2020. Lee's confirmation is merely the official death knell for 5G. As Lee makes clear, not all the stories originally planned for 5G are being abandoned, but DC is no longer setting up a widespread reboot of its comic book line. Nor does it sound like Batman and Superman will get to enjoy retirement anytime soon.A History of DC's Crisis Comics  That's not to say we won't see some sort of new reader-friendly DC relaunch in the near future. As we've explored before, a number of perennial DC books are ending in the next several months (Teen Titans, Suicide Squad, Batgirl) while Brian Michael Bendis is ending his runs on Superman and Action Comics and Joshua Williamson is wrapping up his nearly five-year stint on The Flash. At the very least, we're expecting to see a widespread reshuffling of creative talent in early 2021 and a number of new series announced, even if Lee has previously indicated DC won't publish quite as many monthly comics as it has in recent years.

Lee\'s confirmation is merely the official death knell for 5G. As Lee makes clear, not all the stories originally planned for 5G are being abandoned, but DC is no longer setting up a widespread reboot of its comic book line.

Carel	FINRA	Organization	https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/10-things-to-know-about-securities-litigation-and-enforcement/	Ed. note: Welcome to the second installment of Better Know A Practice Area, a new series introducing readers to different practice areas. Each post is written by an editor at Practical Law who previously practiced in that area and currently writes about it. In case you missed it, you can read the first installment here (discussing capital markets and corporate governance practice).  Today’s topic: securities litigation and enforcement.  What do you do in a typical day?  A typical day of a securities litigation and enforcement associate might involve:  Interviewing custodians of documents potentially responsive to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) request for information. Meeting with a client to prepare her for upcoming testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Department of Justice. Conducting review of a client’s potentially privileged documents, preparing a privilege log, and coordinating production to the SEC. Drafting a portion of the brief in support of a motion dismissing a securities fraud complaint against a client. Strategizing with a joint defense group on coordinated discovery and oral argument on a motion in a case asserting claims under the federal securities laws. Preparing a deposition outline for a witness in a securities fraud case.  Who do you work with?  Junior associates mostly work with senior associates and sometimes partners. As associates grow more senior, responsibilities increase and associates have more direct contact with clients and the opposite side. In the securities litigation and enforcement practice, the opponents include plaintiffs’ lawyers, enforcement counsel of securities regulators, such as the SEC and FINRA, and often prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office or the DOJ.  Associates in this area are often tasked with coordinating collection, review, and production of documents, which usually requires collaborating with e-discovery vendors and the clients’ IT and legal departments and working with the opposite side. Associates may also be tasked with preparing witnesses for depositions or meetings with regulators, which usually requires multiple meetings or teleconferences with client representatives.  What does a common career path look like?  It’s common knowledge that there is a revolving door between the government and private practice for securities litigation and enforcement lawyers. With increased regulatory oversight in recent years, this is now as true as ever. Lawyers practicing in this area often move to the government after a few years in private practice. The most common government positions are state and federal prosecutors or enforcement counsel at the SEC, CFTC, or FINRA (a non-governmental securities industry regulator). Some lawyers make a career in the government, and others return to private practice as counsel or partner.  Besides government, lawyers in this practice often move to the financial institutions’ in-house litigation teams or compliance departments, or pursue judicial clerkships. Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers are mostly based in major financial centers, such as New York, Chicago or San Francisco.  If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?  This practice area offers a good degree of variety. Regulatory matters can concern different subject matters, from compliance with securities laws’ technical requirements, such as retention of electronic communications, to propriety of corporate disclosures, to allegations of securities fraud. Lawyers involved in these matters often conduct investigations of alleged misconduct, which is perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the practice. Investigations include review of electronic communication, witness interviews, communication with the government, and presentation of findings to the board of directors.  Handling private securities lawsuits most often involves motion practice and voluminous document discovery and depositions. Motions frequently filed in these cases include motion to dismiss, motion to decertify class, and motion for summary judgment.  How much wear and tear?  The work is fast-paced and demanding because the stakes can be high, involving large fines or settlements, industry suspensions and bars, and possibly criminal convictions. Associates are expected to be able to master large amounts of facts quickly and think strategically. Partners are not always able to commit enough time to learning all the facts and regularly rely on associates to supply details and recommendations, especially in large and complex matters.  Associates also invariably review very large amounts of documents and are expected to do so thoroughly and accurately because mistakes can be costly. For instance, making an incorrect privilege call and including a privileged document in the production can result in the assertion of a privilege waiver and have a dramatically negative effect on the case.  Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?  Lawyers practicing securities litigation and enforcement tend to like the practice. That said, handling matters involving some of the securities laws’ more technical aspects may be a less than exciting experience. As for most litigators, coordinating and conducting the review and production of large amounts of documents is probably the most tedious part of the job. Most securities litigators also don’t enjoy having to become familiar with the fine print in the documentation supporting fraud claims, such as the often massive offering documentation for a security or a company’s annual filings.  Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?  Most lawyers practicing in this area enjoy being involved in cases with high stakes, often accompanied by media coverage and publicity. Some of the most exciting parts of the practice are conducting internal investigations to uncover potential wrongdoing and battling prosecutors on the admissibility of wiretap evidence, propriety of search warrants and other devices available to the government.  Lawyers in this area also tend to be smart and competent. So, whether an attorney is on a joint defense team or across the table from them, working with good lawyers is a privilege. In addition, the world of securities litigation and enforcement lawyers is relatively small, so people are mostly courteous and professional because they know that they will likely meet again.  Are there common avenues out of this practice area?  Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers who don’t want to continue practicing in this area often make a move to securities regulatory agencies, or become federal or state prosecutors or in-house compliance officers.  What are some market trends that impact this practice area?  Volatility of financial markets has a great impact on securities regulation and litigation. On the one hand, financial crises bring about litigation and increased regulatory oversight. On the other, bull markets result in increased transactional activity (mergers, IPOs, etc.), which give rise to litigation and changes in regulatory landscape. In general, the more market activity, the more work for securities litigators and enforcement lawyers.  Currently, the legal matters concerning the 2008 mortgage crisis are winding down and markets have largely recovered. Many practitioners think that the next wave of work in the securities litigation and enforcement area will be in lawsuits concerning a large number of IPOs that took place during the last several years. In addition, the securities regulators and the DOJ appear increasingly focused on enforcing compliance with securities laws and holding individuals responsible for misconduct, which will likely result in an uptick in the enforcement matters.  If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?  Beside genuine, demonstrated interest in financial markets, a good candidate would have all the usual qualities of a good litigator: thoroughness, attention to detail, good judgment, and ability to express herself clearly both orally and in writing.  Also, handling a large regulatory matter or representing a defendant in a securities class action can be a protracted and often frustrating experience. So, patience and an even-keeled demeanor will also be helpful to attorneys practicing in this area.

To suspend a transaction, there must be a serious suspicion such as:  the transaction has an extraordinary nature; the person(s) carrying out the transaction have been identified to be related to the crime as a result of research through several databases or other sources; or there is a probability that the completion of the transaction will inhibit or aggravate confiscation of the funds which may be related to financing of terrorism or crime proceeds.  Related parties shall abstain from carrying out the transactions included in a suspicious transaction report until MASAK serves the Ministry of Finance’s decision to them. The suspension may last for up to seven business days.  Assets identified by MASAK  If there are documents or serious indications supporting that the concerned assets are related to money laundering and/or financing of terrorism, the Minister of Finance will decide on the suspension of the transactions and the decision will be served to the relevant responsible party by MASAK. The responsible party will not be able to carry out the transactions specified in the Minister of Finance’s decision for seven business days.  Requests of AML institutions  If there are documents or serious indications supporting that transactions reported by foreign AML institutions are related to money laundering and/or financing of terrorism, MASAK will evaluate the request and the Minister of Finance will decide thereon. The Minister of Finance will render its decision based on the reciprocity principle. MASAK will serve the Minister of Finance’s decision on suspension of the transactions and the responsible party will not be able carry out the concerned transactions for seven business days.  Conclusion  As part of the fight against the terrorist organization that orchestrated the attempted coup, the Turkish Government, under the constitutionally granted authority, has been expected to issue expedient and effective legislation for expeditious elimination of terrorist threats. The Regulation is among the precautions taken in the last two weeks to provide for a legal infrastructure which will enable Government officials to respond strongly to those who have been involved in the coup attempt by making it possible to block suspicious fund transfers.

Carel	Lori Loughlin	Individual	https://yourteenmag.com/stuff-we-love/celebrity-interviews/celebrity-interview-lori-loughlin	Remember the TV show Full House? Perhaps you, like many of the show’s fans, had a big-time crush on actress Lori Loughlin, who played Rebecca. These days, you can find Lori Loughlin starring in the Hallmark Channel’s popular series When Calls the Heart. Recently, the actress talked to Your Teen about raising teenagers in her own full house.  Interview with Actress Lori Loughlin  Q: How many children do you have?  Loughlin: I have two daughters — 14 and 15 — and a 22-year-old stepson.  Q: How would you describe yourself as a parent of teenagers?  Loughlin: I try to be open-minded and patient. It’s trickier now that the girls are teenagers because they look at me like I’m not hip or cool — like I don’t really know what’s going on. I try to parent so that they don’t really realize they’re being parented and approach them in a way that’s not too aggressive or stern. For the most part, I’m there in it, with the everyday ebb and flow of their moods. And yes, it can be challenging.  Q: Do your daughters want to act?  Loughlin: When they were younger, they would say that they wanted to act, but I don’t hear about it anymore. I think my older one would like to work in fashion, in some capacity, and my younger one loves makeup. I would not be surprised if she became a makeup artist. She’s 14 and shows a lot of talent for it. They both could end up doing something behind the camera.  Q: Neither one has done theater in high school?  Loughlin: They go to a wonderful school with a great theater program, but they have not auditioned for anything. You’re either passionate about theater (you want to get on that stage) or you aren’t. Since they’ve never auditioned, I know that they’re not that interested.  Q: And when did you know that you wanted to act?  Loughlin: I knew when I was five years old. I grew up in New York and was exposed to Broadway shows from a young age. I loved movies as a child and that was always my fantasy and the vision.  Q: Was it hard getting into the industry?  Loughlin: Not really. When I was about 12 years old, my mother’s friend invited me to go with her daughters to a modeling agency. My mom agreed, probably thinking that nothing would come of it. But, they hired me for some print work and modeling. I started out modeling and then doing commercials. When I was a teenager, I got a role on a daytime soap opera. But, we went into this completely blind, figuring it out as we went along.  Q: And how did you, at that young age, keep your head on your shoulders?  Loughlin: My father said to me, “Listen, we will support you, and we will help you, but if I see any change in your attitude, you’re done. You’re out.” Also, I have a nice, down-to-earth family with no sense of entitlement. I was raised to be a grateful and courteous human being.  Q: I love that you said, “grateful and courteous.” How do you instill that in your teenagers?  Loughlin: I certainly try. My girls have rules to follow. My husband and I teach them good manners and gratitude. And, it’s funny — when we are out with kids who are, in their opinion, somewhat spoiled or impolite, my girls really notice and comment. And, I always say to them, “Let that be a lesson to you. People notice if you have manners, if you’re courteous and if you’re kind. People pay attention to that stuff.” And, it’s important just to be a good human being and put your best foot forward because certainly, like my grandmother used to say, “We all came into the world the same way, and we will all leave in the same way, and no one is more special or better than the next guy.” That’s what I try to instill in my kids.  Q: Are your kids growing up differently than you did?  Loughlin: In some ways. They have access in a different way than I did. I watched Scott Baio on TV, dreaming one day about meeting him. My girls have big crushes on Justin Bieber, and they were able to meet him. But, I try to keep that at a minimum. I don’t let them go to a party or a premiere on a school night. We just try to keep it as normal as possible.  Q: Wow, invited to a premiere, and they get told “No.” That’s something I don’t have to deal with.  Loughlin: Because of what I do, they have access in a different way. But, I always tell my girls that being famous isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. You know, being a good person, working hard, achieving goals — that’s what it’s all about. Fame doesn’t mean very much.  Q: Are you relieved that your girls didn’t go down that path at a young age?  Loughlin: I never gave them that opportunity. I told them to get an education and then explore acting. I didn’t go to college because I was busy working. And I always had this “sink or swim” feeling in my life. I want my girls to have something more substantial to fall back on if it doesn’t work out because it can be a hard business. But, like I said, they have not shown any interest in being in front of the camera.  Q: Can you share a best and worst parenting moment?  Loughlin: Oh my goodness, I am sure I have many of both. I have definitely lost my temper and reacted too quickly. The girls can catch me at a moment after they have been at me all day, and I just snap. I am not proud of those moments, but I know they probably happen to all of us. And, my best parenting moment is when I take a step back and don’t respond immediately, when I take a deep breath and collect myself. If something comes up in the morning and instead of reacting to it, I revisit it later in the day after I have collected my thoughts and can talk about it calmly.  Q: So you could write the parenting book.  Loughlin: I couldn’t write any parenting book. Boy oh boy. I am just out there every day, swinging at it and doing the best I can. Some days are more successful than others, but I certainly don’t ever pretend to have any of the answers. I just don’t.  Q: Well nobody does, but you sound like you have some thoughtful approaches, which is good.  Loughlin: I try. In my work, in my marriage, in my parenting, I try. I set that goal for myself every day. Whether I achieve it or not, I don’t know. Some days are better than others, like I said.  Q: Shifting from parenting, do you have a favorite role?  Loughlin: I did a TV movie many years ago for FOX called, Doing Time on Maple Drive, with Ken Olin and a great cast. I really loved my character in that piece. I just loved the whole message of that movie.  Loughlin: Yes, we are in fact. We are absolutely still in touch. And, I am always talking to John Stamos and Candace Cameron.

Perhaps you, like many of the show’s fans, had a big-time crush on actress Lori Loughlin, who played Rebecca. These days, you can find Lori Loughlin starring in the Hallmark Channel’s popular series When Calls the Heart. Recently, the actress talked to Your Teen about raising teenagers in her own full house.\n\nInterview with Actress Lori Loughlin\n\nQ: How many children do you have?\n\nLoughlin: I have two daughters — 14 and 15 — and a 22-year-old stepson.\n\nQ: How would you describe yourself as a parent of teenagers?\n\nLoughlin: I try to be open-minded and patient. It’s trickier now that the girls are teenagers because they look at me like I’m not hip or cool — like I don’t really know what’s going on. I try to parent so that they don’t really realize they’re being parented and approach them in a way that’s not too aggressive or stern. For the most part, I’m there in it, with the everyday ebb and flow of their moods. And yes, it can be challenging.\n\nQ: Do your daughters want to act?\n\nLoughlin: When they were younger, they would say that they wanted to act, but I don’t hear about it anymore. I think my older one would like to work in fashion, in some capacity, and my younger one loves makeup. I would not be surprised if she became a makeup artist. She’s 14 and shows a lot of talent for it. They both could end up doing something behind the camera.\n\nQ: Neither one has done theater in high school?\n\nLoughlin: They go to a wonderful school with a great theater program, but they have not auditioned for anything. You’re either passionate about theater (you want to get on that stage) or you aren’t. Since they’ve never auditioned, I know that they’re not that interested.\n\nQ: And when did you know that you wanted to act?\n\nLoughlin: I knew when I was five years old. I grew up in New York and was exposed to Broadway shows from a young age. I loved movies as a child and that was always my fantasy and the vision.\n\nQ: Was it hard getting into the industry?\n\nLoughlin: Not really. When I was about 12 years old, my mother’s friend invited me to go with her daughters to a modeling agency. My mom agreed, probably thinking that nothing would come of it. But, they hired me for some print work and modeling. I started out modeling and then doing commercials. When I was a teenager, I got a role on a daytime soap opera. But, we went into this completely blind, figuring it out as we went along.\n\nQ: And how did you, at that young age, keep your head on your shoulders?\n\nLoughlin: My father said to me, “Listen, we will support you, and we will help you, but if I see any change in your attitude, you’re done. You’re out.” Also, I have a nice, down-to-earth family with no sense of entitlement. I was raised to be a grateful and courteous human being.\n\nQ: I love that you said, “grateful and courteous.” How do you instill that in your teenagers?\n\nLoughlin: I certainly try. My girls have rules to follow. My husband and I teach them good manners and gratitude. And, it’s funny — when we are out with kids who are, in their opinion, somewhat spoiled or impolite, my girls really notice and comment. And, I always say to them, “Let that be a lesson to you. People notice if you have manners, if you’re courteous and if you’re kind. People pay attention to that stuff.” And, it’s important just to be a good human being and put your best foot forward because certainly, like my grandmother used to say, “We all came into the world the same way, and we will all leave in the same way, and no one is more special or better than the next guy.” That’s what I try to instill in my kids.\n\nQ: Are your kids growing up differently than you did?\n\nLoughlin: In some ways. They have access in a different way than I did. I watched Scott Baio on TV, dreaming one day about meeting him. My girls have big crushes on Justin Bieber, and they were able to meet him. But, I try to keep that at a minimum. I don’t let them go to a party or a premiere on a school night. We just try to keep it as normal as possible.\n\nQ: Wow, invited to a premiere, and they get told “No.” That’s something I don’t have to deal with.\n\nLoughlin: Because of what I do, they have access in a different way. But, I always tell my girls that being famous isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. You know, being a good person, working hard, achieving goals — that’s what it’s all about.

Carel	Anonymous	Organization	https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/we-shouldnt-be-relying-on-hackers-to-stop-terrorism-financing	Strengthen Banks' Incentives to Choke Off Terrorists' Cash Flow Counterterrorism finance efforts should shift away from our current compliance-based structure toward one that rewards ingenuity and activism among banks. May 24 Law and regulation What Terrorism Risk Insurance Means for Banks Banks have stepped up efforts to extend the government's terrorism risk insurance program, fearing that Congress may fail to act before it is scheduled to expire at yearend. By Victoria Finkle March 6  The fight against terrorist financing took a fascinating turn last week as several international hacking groups announced plans to target banks, countries and individuals who had helped to finance the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and other terrorist organizations.  The plan, dubbed #OpCharlieHebdo, was formed by groups including Anonymous and Ghost Security in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. It is intriguing and somewhat unsettling that hackers would make decisions about financial institutions' compliance with counter-terrorism measures. But their efforts underscore the need for governments, banks and regulators to work harder at rooting out the sources of ISIS's funding.  Experts agree that ISIS is funded primarily by external transactions such as black market oil sales and ransom payments, as well as internal transactions such as tax collection, human trafficking and bank takeovers. When external transactions are completed in cash, they have ties to the formal banking system. For example, ransom payments originate from bank accounts of insurance companies and government agencies in the European Union, which use brokers to make cash payments to terrorists. And, as Notre Dame law professor and former Treasury under secretary for enforcement Jimmy Gurulé testified before the House Committee on Financial Services in November, "If ISIS is generating $1 to $2 million dollars a day from the illicit sale of oil, it is difficult to imagine that banks are not being used to transfer such large sums of money to entities controlled by ISIS."  This concern was echoed by David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in an October speech. He said:  ISIL's ability to make the most effective use of money that it raises depends on its access to the banking system in Syria, Iraq, and internationally. Operating entirely in cash is both cumbersome and risky  cash is bulky, vulnerable to theft, and requires complicated logistics to transport. Moreover, ISIL will have a hard time funding external operations, including facilitating the movement of foreign fighters, without access to the international financial system.  "Scores of bank branches are located in territories where ISIL operates," Cohen continued, vowing to prevent the terrorist group from using those branches. "The private sector is playing a key role in provid[ing] valuable insight into financial activity in areas where ISIL operates."  It's clear that counter-terrorist financing measures are necessary to defeat ISIS. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that the measures implemented thus far have left much to be desired.  For one thing, the Financial Action Task Force's evaluations of different countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards often miss the mark. Macau is a case in point: the money laundering capital of Asia received a glowing evaluation.  Many financial institutions also tend to pay negligible attention to counter-terrorist financing law. Thousands of compliance officers are experts in complying with the law rather than interpreting it. This is not necessarily their fault: we should not be tasking compliance officers with interpreting the law if they are not lawyers.  Moreover, the U.S. devotes enormous resources to enforcing AML compliance but fails to take the same measures in the higher-risk area of counter-terrorist financing compliance. As Gurulé noted in his testimony, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has brought only two major cases against banks charged with violating the anti-terrorist financing provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act in the last decade. Our priorities ought to be the reverse. Terrorist financing kills people and directly threatens democracy. Money laundering does not.  If counter-terrorist financing laws had been effectively enforced, ISIS would never have risen to power, occupying an area the size of the United Kingdom. Nor would it have had the financial capacity to start and continue its horrific reign of terror.  These failures have not been lost on Anonymous and their colleagues. They are fighting ISIS in the digital shadows precisely because we have not been able to prevent ISIS from thriving financially.  If you are a director or officer of a global financial institution, fund, online payment processor or money services business, the idea that hackers are engaged in counter-terrorist financing efforts should be frightening. Banks are now answerable to people who are not only anonymous, but who can  with a few clicks  take the bank offline and download data on any client, transaction, or executive. Moreover, they aim to make banks answerable in the court of public opinion for unwittingly funding terrorism.  So far, #OpCharlieHebdo has taken down the websites of government agencies in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey as well as about 80 websites believed to be controlled by ISIS that publish terrorist propaganda. And while the hacking groups haven't taken down any banks yet, they have given notice to banks in Saudi Arabia that they will be targeted. That could well apply to Western banks in Saudi Arabia, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.  Some people reading this likely applaud hackers' efforts to shut down ISIS websites and debilitate them. Everyone, including Wall Street bankers, can love an anti-hero.  But vigilante justice will lose its allure if hackers infiltrate our financial institutions and  without the benefit of experience in counter-terrorism law  make judgment calls about the culpability of banks and their executives. Such judgments cannot be fairly made in the absence of the rule of law.  In order for democracy to work, we must all subscribe to its ideals. Hackers must play by the rules. And banks and regulators must crack down on compliance in order to mitigate terrorist financing.  Clearly, we are at a point in history where banks must be exceedingly vigilant. Anonymous is indeed watching.

It is intriguing and somewhat unsettling that hackers would make decisions about financial institutions\' compliance with counter-terrorism measures. But their efforts underscore the need for governments, banks and regulators to work harder at rooting out the sources of ISIS\'s funding.\n\nExperts agree that ISIS is funded primarily by external transactions such as black market oil sales and ransom payments, as well as internal transactions such as tax collection, human trafficking and bank takeovers. When external transactions are completed in cash, they have ties to the formal banking system. For example, ransom payments originate from bank accounts of insurance companies and government agencies in the European Union, which use brokers to make cash payments to terrorists. And, as Notre Dame law professor and former Treasury under secretary for enforcement Jimmy Gurulé testified before the House Committee on Financial Services in November, "If ISIS is generating $1 to $2 million dollars a day from the illicit sale of oil, it is difficult to imagine that banks are not being used to transfer such large sums of money to entities controlled by ISIS."\n\nThis concern was echoed by David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in an October speech. He said:\n\nISIL\'s ability to make the most effective use of money that it raises depends on its access to the banking system in Syria, Iraq, and internationally. Operating entirely in cash is both cumbersome and risky \x97 cash is bulky, vulnerable to theft, and requires complicated logistics to transport. Moreover, ISIL will have a hard time funding external operations, including facilitating the movement of foreign fighters, without access to the international financial system.\n\n"Scores of bank branches are located in territories where ISIL operates," Cohen continued, vowing to prevent the terrorist group from using those branches. "The private sector is playing a key role in provid[ing] valuable insight into financial activity in areas where ISIL operates."\n\nIt\'s clear that counter-terrorist financing measures are necessary to defeat ISIS. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that the measures implemented thus far have left much to be desired.\n\nFor one thing, the Financial Action Task Force\'s evaluations of different countries\' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards often miss the mark.

It is intriguing and somewhat unsettling that hackers would make decisions about financial institutions\' compliance with counter-terrorism measures. But their efforts underscore the need for governments, banks and regulators to work harder at rooting out the sources of ISIS\'s funding.</p>\n\n<p>Experts agree that ISIS is funded primarily by external transactions such as <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/27/business/isis-wealthiest-terror-group-defterios/" data-cms-ai="0">black market oil sales</a> and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/multiple-kidnappings-for-ransom-funding-isis-source-says/" data-cms-ai="0">ransom payments</a>, as well as internal transactions such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2014/08/18/how-isis-is-using-taxes-to-build-a-terrorist-state/" data-cms-ai="0">tax collection</a>, <a href="http://rt.com/news/187720-isis-millions-daily-profit/" data-cms-ai="0">human trafficking</a> and <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/how-isis-became-the-richest-terrorist-group-in-the-world-1.1872634" data-cms-ai="0">bank takeovers</a>. When external transactions are completed in cash, they have ties to the formal banking system. For example, ransom payments originate from bank accounts of insurance companies and government agencies in the European Union, which use brokers to make cash payments to terrorists. And, as Notre Dame law professor and former Treasury under secretary for enforcement Jimmy Gurulé testified before the House Committee on Financial Services <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-jgurule-20141113.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">in November</a>, "If ISIS is generating $1 to $2 million dollars a day from the illicit sale of oil, it is difficult to imagine that banks are not being used to transfer such large sums of money to entities controlled by ISIS."</p>\n\n<p>This concern was echoed by David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in an <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2672.aspx" data-cms-ai="0">October speech</a>. He said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>ISIL\'s ability to make the most effective use of money that it raises depends on its access to the banking system in Syria, Iraq, and internationally.\xa0 Operating entirely in cash is both cumbersome and risky \x97 cash is bulky, vulnerable to theft, and requires complicated logistics to transport. Moreover, ISIL will have a hard time funding external operations, including facilitating the movement of foreign fighters, without access to the international financial system.</blockquote>\n\n<p>"Scores of bank branches are located in territories where ISIL operates," Cohen continued, vowing to prevent the terrorist group from using those branches. "The private sector is playing a key role in \x85 provid[ing] valuable insight into financial activity in areas where ISIL operates."</p>\n\n<p>It\'s clear that counter-terrorist financing measures are necessary to defeat ISIS. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that the measures implemented thus far have left much to be desired.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the Financial Action Task Force\'s evaluations of different countries\' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards often miss the mark. Macau is a case in point: the money laundering capital of Asia received a glowing evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>Many financial institutions also tend to pay negligible attention to counter-terrorist financing law. Thousands of compliance officers are experts in complying with the law rather than interpreting it. This is not necessarily their fault: we should not be tasking compliance officers with interpreting the law if they are not lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the U.S. devotes enormous resources to enforcing AML compliance but fails to take the same measures in the higher-risk area of counter-terrorist financing compliance. As Gurulé noted in his <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-jgurule-20141113.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">testimony</a>, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has brought only two major cases against banks charged with violating the anti-terrorist financing provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act in the last decade. Our priorities ought to be the reverse. Terrorist financing kills people and directly threatens democracy. Money laundering does not.</p>\n\n<p>If counter-terrorist financing laws had been effectively enforced, ISIS would never have risen to power, occupying an area the size of the United Kingdom. Nor would it have had the financial capacity to start and continue its horrific reign of terror.</p>\n\n<p>These failures have not been lost on Anonymous and their colleagues. They are fighting ISIS in the digital shadows precisely because we have not been able to prevent ISIS from thriving financially.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a director or officer of a global financial institution, fund, online payment processor or money services business, the idea that hackers are engaged in counter-terrorist financing efforts should be frightening. Banks are now answerable to people who are not only anonymous, but who can \x97 with a few clicks \x97 take the bank offline and download data on any client, transaction, or executive. Moreover, they aim to make banks answerable in the court of public opinion for unwittingly funding terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>So far, #OpCharlieHebdo has taken down the websites of government agencies in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey as well as about 80 <a href="http://www.hackersnewsbulletin.com/2015/01/list-damage-opcharliehebdo-anonymous.html#websites" data-cms-ai="0">websites</a> believed to be controlled by ISIS that publish terrorist propaganda. And while the hacking groups haven\'t taken down any banks yet, they have given notice to banks in Saudi Arabia that they will be targeted. That could well apply to Western banks in Saudi Arabia, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.</p>\n\n<p>Some people reading this likely applaud hackers\' efforts to shut down ISIS websites and debilitate them. Everyone, including Wall Street bankers, can love an anti-hero.</p>\n\n<p>But vigilante justice will lose its allure if hackers infiltrate our financial institutions and \x97 without the benefit of experience in counter-terrorism law \x97 make judgment calls about the culpability of banks and their executives. Such judgments cannot be fairly made in the absence of the rule of law.</p>\n\n<p>In order for democracy to work, we must all subscribe to its ideals. Hackers must play by the rules. And banks and regulators must crack down on compliance in order to mitigate terrorist financing.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, we are at a point in history where banks must be exceedingly vigilant. Anonymous is indeed watching.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2017-01-10T15:49:56.655Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2015-01-23T17:00:00Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	fight against money to terrorism	sebastien	Carel: unsure	We Shouldn't Be Relying on Hackers to Stop Terrorism Financing
Carel	Lauren Resnick	Individual	https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/terrorist-financing-growing-worry-for-us-banks-i-3125	Growing worries about the use of the U.S. financial system to launder funds for terrorists has spurred proposals for new state and federal regulations aimed at tightening money-laundering controls.  "If you look at what's been happening in terrorism around the world, ISIS is an example of a terrorist organization that is now becoming sufficiently institutionalized in terms of its access to natural resources and substantial amounts of money," says cybercrime attorney Lauren Resnick, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where she led the computer crimes and intellectual property section. She now works at the law firm BakerHostetler.  "So, the view is that terrorist financing is hitting a new stage. And while individual acts of terrorism are not necessarily costly, we have major organizations around the world that may want to access the U.S. financial system because they have significant amounts of capital to invest. That is a big concern among the players in the financial industry, as well as the regulators."  State and Federal Regulatory Changes  In an exclusive interview with Information Security Media Group, Resnick explains how proposed state and federal regulatory changes for Bank Secrecy Act compliance are spurring banks and other financial services firms to use intelligence and anomaly detection to more proactively detect suspicious activity.  "Many of the major banks have actually developed intelligence divisions alongside their anti-money-laundering compliance groups, that are composed of former military and law enforcement intelligence officers, to conduct data analytics, to make sure that they're looking at trends in the transaction activity that is proactive, and not simply reactive, to identify any potential nexus or contact with known terrorist organizations," she says. "So it's taking on a new level of both financial commitment and resource commitment at many global banks."  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in August proposed rules that would require investment advisers, including certain hedge funds and private fund managers, to establish anti-money-laundering programs and report suspicious activity - basically requiring that investment advisers comply with the same Bank Secrecy Act requirements as banks and other financial entities. And in December, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced proposals for new AML and terrorist financing regulations that would require senior financial executives to certify the effectiveness of AML systems.  New York's proposed regulatory oversight aims to address perceived shortcomings in Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs, Resnick says.  During this interview (see audio link below photo), Resnick also discusses:  Why regulators want to see banks investing in "meaningful" transactions monitoring that uses a rules-based approach; How AML departments and staff are viewed as being more critical to business operations than they were three years ago; and Why steep BSA fines have helped AML departments acquire bigger budgets to fund transaction monitoring systems.  Resnick is a member of the white collar and corporate investigations team at the law firm BakerHostetler. She is regularly retained by executive management and audit committees of Fortune 500 corporations to conduct internal investigations on FCPA; AML; trade sanctions and OFAC; securities fraud; accounting; and employment matters, and to provide advice about cybercrime issues.

Shakshi	Ukraine	Country	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to navigation Jump to search  Ukraine is divided into several levels of territorial entities. On the first level there are 27 regions: [1]  24 oblasts one autonomous republic two cities with special status [2]  Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, Crimea and Sevastopol came under the de facto administration of the Russian Federation, which claims them as the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol. Internationally, most states have not recognised the Russian claims.  Ukraine directly inherited its administrative divisions from the local republican administration of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the overall structure has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century. It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various populated places, particularly cities.  According to the Article 133 of Constitution of Ukraine, "the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages." Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city. [3]  Ukraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:  By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages). By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units. By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of prime level (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of middle level (districts, cities with district division), and of higher level (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status). Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.  Regions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the cabinet of ministers. [4] Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality – vykonkom) and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.  Ukraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: oblast (region), raion (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the Ukrainian parliament. The following table is based on the 2001 Ukrainian Census. [5]  Table (after 2020)[ edit ]  Following the 2020 administrative reform all populated places in Ukraine (except for Kyiv and Sevastopol) were resubordinated to districts.  List[ edit ]  The following numbers are based on the 2001 Ukrainian Census. [5]  Top level (Regions, 27): [3]  Autonomous Republic of Crimea Oblasts of Ukraine (24) Cities with special status: Kyiv and Sevastopol  Middle level (Regional subdivision, 786):  Raions (490) Cities of oblast significance (178) City districts (райони у містах) (118)  Primary level (Local communities, 11,515):  Cities of raion significance (276) Urban-type settlements (селища міського типу) (885) Villages (села) (27,190) Rural-type settlements (селища) (1,266)  Total cities: 454, an increase of 20 compared with the 1989 census. [5]  History[ edit ]  Main articles: Administrative divisions development in Ukraine and Ukrainian historical regions  Before the introduction of oblasts in 1932, Ukraine comprised 40 okruhas, which had replaced the former Russian Imperial guberniya (governorate) subdivisions.  In 1932 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was re-established based on oblasts. Excluded in the administrative changes was Western Ukraine, which at that time formed part of the Second Polish Republic and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on voivodeships.  In the post- World War II period, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic consisted of 25 oblasts and two cities with special status.  After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.  The top level: duchy (land) → palatinate (voivodeship) → regiments (polk) / palanka → governorate → okruha → oblast → TBD The intermediate level: apanage duchy → county (povit) / eldership (starostvo) → hundered (sotnia) → raion → county (povit) The local level: volost → kurin / community (hromada) → volost → council (rada) → community (hromada)  First-level administrative divisions[ edit ]  Autonomous republic[ edit ]  Main article: Autonomous Republic of Crimea  The Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine. Its capital is Simferopol. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.  On March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a subject into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262 by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.  Oblasts[ edit ]  Main article: Oblasts of Ukraine  Oblasts are on the first (top) level of the administrative division of Ukraine.  Almost every oblast is named after its administrative center, except for four oblasts. Volyn' and Zakarpattia, whose respective capitals are Lutsk and Uzhhorod, are named after historic regions Volhynia and Transcarpathia. The administrative centers of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Kirovohrad Oblast were renamed to Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi in 2016, however as of 2017 the oblasts still officially bear the old soviet names as their change must be reflected in an amendment to the Ukrainian Constitution.  Each oblast is administered by a governor.  The table below reflects changes made in 2020.  Cherkasy Oblast 20,891 1,291,135 61.80 Cherkasy 4 Chernihiv Oblast 31,851.3 1,104,241 34.67 Chernihiv 5 Chernivtsi Oblast 8,093.6 903,782 111.67 Chernivtsi 3 Dnipropetrovsk Oblast 31,900.5 3,344,073 104.83 Dnipro 7 Donetsk Oblast 26,505.7 4,448,031 167.81 Donetsk 8 Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast 13,894.0 1,380,770 99.38 Ivano-Frankivsk 6 Kharkiv Oblast 31,401.6 2,755,177 87.74 Kharkiv 7 Kherson Oblast 28,449 1,091,151 38.35 Kherson 5 Khmelnytskyi Oblast 20,636.2 1,331,534 64.52 Khmelnytskyi 3 Kyiv Oblast 28,118.9 1,719,602 61.15 Kyiv 7 Kirovohrad Oblast 24,577.5 1,014,809 41.29 Kropyvnytskyi 4 Luhansk Oblast 26,672.5 2,300,412 86.25 Luhansk 8 Lviv Oblast 21,823.7 2,545,634 116.65 Lviv 7 Mykolaiv Oblast 24,587.4 1,186,452 48.25 Mykolaiv 4 Odessa Oblast 33,295.9 2,387,636 71.71 Odessa 7 Poltava Oblast 28,735.8 1,493,668 51.98 Poltava 4 Rivne Oblast 20,038.5 1,152,576 57.52 Rivne 4 Sumy Oblast 23,823.9 1,166,765 48.97 Sumy 5 Ternopil Oblast 13,817.1 1,086,694 78.65 Ternopil 3 Vinnytsia Oblast 26,501.6 1,646,250 62.12 Vinnytsia 6 Volyn Oblast 20,135.3 1,038,223 51.56 Lutsk 4 Zakarpattia Oblast 12,771.5 1,246,323 97.59 Uzhhorod 6 Zaporizhzhia Oblast 27,168.5 1,805,431 66.45 Zaporizhzhia 6 Zhytomyr Oblast 29,819.2 1,283,201 43.03 Zhytomyr 4  Main article: Cities with special status  Two cities carry special status: the city of Kyiv which is the capital of Ukraine and the city of Sevastopol. Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, Sevastopol is controlled by Russia and is incorporated as a federal subject of Russia. It is recognized as a part of Ukraine by most of the international community.  Second-level administrative units[ edit ]  Cities of regional significance (regional cities)[ edit ]  Main article: City of regional significance (Ukraine)  Raions[ edit ]  Main article: Raions of Ukraine  Raions are smaller territorial units of subdivision in Ukraine. There are 136 raions. [7] According to December 2019 draft constitutional changes submitted to the Verkhovna Rada by President Volodymyr Zelensky united territorial communities are planned to replace the raions of Ukraine. [8]  Third-level administrative units[ edit ]  Further information: Populated places in Ukraine  The Dnieper River plays an important part in Ukrainian territorial division, with many large cities settled on its banks. Here, the capital city of Kyiv which was founded on the Dnieper's right bank but for now expanded over the river significantly.  Ukraine has two types of settlements: rural and urban. Rural populated areas (сільський населений пункт) can be either a village (село, selo) or a rural settlement (селище). Urban populated areas (міський населений пункт) can be either a city (містo) or an urban-type settlement (селище міського типу). For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the English language.  Changes to a settlement's status can be made only by the Verkhovna Rada. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of Prypiat still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.  The typical Ukrainian misto ought to be considered a city, not a town (compare to City status in the United Kingdom). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the political sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.  According to Ukrainian law a city (місто) in Ukraine is a locality of at least 10,000 people. [10] Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of regional (oblast) importance, and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of Kyiv and of Sevastopol have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a city with a special status, which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the President of Ukraine. However, the status of the mayor of Kyiv is somewhat more complex, and for further information see Legal status and local government of Kyiv. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.  Almost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into city raions which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.  Many raions also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.  Other municipalities[ edit ]  In addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the Verkhovna Rada.  Main article: Amalgamated hromada  The smalgamated hromadas (Ukrainian: Об'єднана територіальна громада, Obyednana terytorialʹna hromada) are part of administrative reform that started in 2015. It is intended to replace all councils (local level territorial units). In his draft constitutional amendments of June 2014 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and "hromadas". [11]  On February 5, 2015, the law "On voluntary association of territorial communities" was adopted creating united territorial communities meaning settlement councils, rural councils and a city of district significance can create a new administrative unit. [12] Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada. [13] New local elections in these united territorial communities were then held. [14] 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019. [15] The first 252 were held in 2017. [16]  The Law "On Local Self-Government in Ukraine" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies. [17] Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit amalgamated hromada was created. [17]  Other administrations[ edit ]  Ukraine also has several settlements known as viiskove mistechko which were former military installations. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the secrecy of such settlements has been unveiled, however, the towns are subordinated directly to the Ministry of Defense and do not have their own civil administrations. Such military installations are like ghost towns that are not even identified on a map. One of them, on the border of the Kyiv and Zhytomyr Oblasts is Makarov-1. [18]  A special territory known as the zone of alienation falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Emergencies and was the most severely affected territory by the Chernobyl disaster. Additionally, various restricted nature preserves known as Zapovednik fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ecology.  Due to the War in Donbass, the status of civil–military administrations was created in territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts where the respective local government units cannot exercise their constitutionally guaranteed powers. [19]  Currently, Ukraine has the following 3 enclaves:  The city of Slavutych which is administratively subordinated directly to Kyiv Oblast while being completely surrounded by neighboring Chernihiv Oblast. The settlement of Bile which is located on Snake Island and is fully surrounded by the Black Sea was established in 2007 and is part of Vylkove, Odessa Oblast. [20] The town of Kotsiubynske which is part of the Kyiv Oblast and is completely surrounded by the city of Kyiv.  Metropolitan areas[ edit ]  Ukraine has five major agglomerated metropolitan areas (conurbations). These conurbation areas are not officially recognized and remain to be administered according to official oblast - raion system of subdivision.  Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) geographic division of Ukraine used in their polls.  Beside the administrative divisions, geographical divisions are at times used for reference or statistical purposes. The division splits Ukraine into 4 to 6 geographic areas: Western Ukraine, Eastern Ukraine, Southern Ukraine, Central Ukraine, Northern Ukraine (occasionally used).  The neighboring countries such as Russia, Poland, Hungary and Romania sometimes identify certain parts of Ukraine. For example, Russia has territorial claims to Ukraine stating that the Southeastern Ukraine is part of Russia, [ citation needed ] certain political or public figures in Poland lay territorial claims to western Ukraine identifying them as Borderlands or Kreis (Kresy), [ citation needed ] the same goes for Hungary that calls Zakarpattia Oblast as Kárpátalja. [ citation needed ]  Notes[ edit ]  ^ City municipalities that are administrated as a separate region. ^ Often translated as province ^ Normally identification of rural is not used with raions, while for disambiguation districts in cities are identified with those cities. ^ Regional municipalities may include cities of oblast or republican (in case of Crimea) significance. ^ small municipalities (councils) ^ Often, the identification of "urban" with "settlement" is not used and raises some ambiguity with smaller rural settlements. ^ Also referred to as towns. ^ Normally identification of rural is not used. ^ Often translated as province ^ Normally identification of rural is not used with raions, while for disambiguation districts in cities are identified with those cities. ^ small municipalities (councils) ^ Often, the identification of "urban" with "settlement" is not used and raises some ambiguity with smaller rural settlements. ^ Districts, without accounting for districts in cities  References[ edit ]  "Regions of Ukraine and their composition".

Carel	Alex Marriage	Individual	https://reliefweb.int/report/world/counter-terrorist-financing-and-humanitarian-security	Alex Marriage is Research and Projects Assistant at EISF. He has three years’ experience in international development NGOs primarily working on policy and advocacy. Firstly as an intern for Jubilee Debt Campaign. At the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) Alex contributed to successful international campaigns for corporate and financial transparency to address tax evasion and corruption. Whilst at Eurodad Alex also produced a report on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Since then he has been a trainee at the European Commission Anti-Fraud Office as well as a freelance development researcher.  Introduction  Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have found that counter-terrorist financing (CTF) rules have been interpreted and implemented by national governments and banks in a way which has delayed aid and put NGO staff at greater security risk. In response to civil society concerns, the global standard setting body for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorist financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), revised its approach in October 2016 to reflect civil society organisations’ concerns.  Charities had originally been classified as ‘particularly vulnerable’ to abuse by terrorists by FATF, although this classification was recently removed. The abuse that FATF and others have been concerned about can take various forms: from fake NGOs to legitimate organisations being defrauded to acquire or channel money. Partners or suppliers might also be set up or abused by terrorists. The rules are intended to make organisations take reasonable steps to check that funds are not being diverted. It is important for an NGO (as for any organisation) to demonstrate due diligence, meaning that they have good systems in place to detect terrorist financing. There is an obligation to report if an organisation suspects funds have been diverted to terrorists.  In this blog, I will briefly outline the security risks that aid workers can and have faced due to counter-terrorist financing measures, and go on to describe the international mechanism through which CTF measures are developed and evaluated. I will go on to outline the recent changes to CTF recommendations and what this might mean for humanitarian NGOs.  What are the security concerns?  NGOs have been affected by the way in which states and the private sector have implemented CTF standards, as recommended by FATF and each government’s own counter-terrorism policy advisors. One problem has been that authoritarian governments have been able to use CTF to justify the repression of human rights defenders and advocacy organisations operating in their countries. In addition, humanitarian NGOs have seen their banks introduce new measures to comply with CTF legislation, which has resulted in operational and security concerns overseas. This has predominantly manifested itself through:  Banks refusing to transfer funds or keep accounts open in high-risk geographical areas. The introduction of greater security checks and information requests by banks.  Non-standard money transfer routes  Some banks, not wanting to fall foul of the AML-CTF legislation, have opted to simply not transfer funds to payees in conflict zones and areas where terrorists operate. Some have completely stopped doing business with NGOs and local banks operating in these areas. This action is known as de-risking.  If banks refuse to transfer funds, then some NGOs have opted to use cash couriers leading to the risk of robbery and harm to aid workers transporting cash. Others have started using the informal hawala system, which some NGOs have reported can cause security incidents. It is ironic that the effects of this legislation often push NGOs into more marginal, riskier and less traceable forms of money transfer where it is more likely to be misappropriated on route to beneficiaries.  Beneficiary vetting  Under some legislation, if any terrorist benefits from a service directly or indirectly, this can count as material support to a terrorist group. This could include food or emergency medical care. It has often been pointed out that this contradicts the humanitarian principles that state that aid should be given to all those in need.  As a result of these laws, some banks expect aid organisations to know an unrealistic amount about their beneficiaries, to have a procedure in place to prevent this. Such requests also ignore the guidance from FATF that banks do not need to ‘know their customer’s customer’. Attempting to meet this expectation could be perceived as spying and can cause an NGO to use up scarce resources. Requiring more staff on the ground, for example, has security implications, especially in a conflict zone.  Additionally, if an NGO attempts to meet this request by collecting lists of beneficiaries this could lead to host states asking to see such lists, potentially endangering beneficiaries or creating mistrust if the NGO refuses to share this information. This could affect an NGO’s local acceptance and therefore the security of aid staff operating in that geographical area.  Security checks  Some banks have instituted additional security checks before approving the transfer of funds, thus causing delays in implementation that can have serious implications for an NGO’s operational security. This delay can also be caused by an NGO not being fully prepared to answer the questions that some banks have posed in a timely manner.  Who makes the rules and what are the recent developments?  FATF is a global intergovernmental body set up to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It makes recommendations, which states then transpose into their own legislation. FATF has developed a series of recommendations that are recognised as the international standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  Many of these rules involve setting standards which the banking industry and other private and non-governmental groups must comply with. In 2016, as a result of advocacy by civil society, FATF revised its recommendation in relation to the non-profit sector and accordingly updated its mutual evaluation methodology, which is used to assess how well countries are implementing these rules. In June 2016, after consultation with the non-profit sector, FATF revised its Recommendation 8 and related interpretive note, which relates to non-profit organisations specifically. The body changed the wording of the recommendation so non-profit organisations were no longer considered ‘particularly vulnerable’ to terrorist financing schemes. Furthermore, in October 2016, the mutual evaluation methodology was also updated by FATF. Mutual evaluations are one of FATF’s main sources of leverage. Bad mutual evaluation scores can lead to a country’s banks being cut off from the international financial system. The most significant changes made to the guidance for evaluation assessors are as follows: Supervision of non-profits should focus on those that the country’s government has identified as being at risk of terrorist financing abuse rather than the whole sector. The guidance now emphasises that such supervision should be ‘focused and proportionate’. Assessors will now consider whether ‘legitimate charitable activities are not disrupted or discouraged’ by measures put in place to counter terrorist financing. Evaluations take about 18 months and ongoing evaluations will continue to use the old criteria. Therefore, it will take some time to see how effective the changes are.  What now?  The changes made by FATF, whilst very significant, are just a first step and will not necessarily lead to automatic changes in national rules. However, there is increasing awareness of the negative effects CTF has had on civil society organisations, particularly those NGOs operating in high terrorism risk areas. For example, in the UK, a working group is being set up between the government and NGOs; Chatham House has published research on the contradictions between CTF/counter-terrorism and international humanitarian law; and Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) are also researching this topic.  Robust rules must be in place to counter financing of terrorism but these rules should not stop aid reaching the millions of victims of terrorism and conflict. Organisations need to be able to securely finance humanitarian operations in a way that minimises unnecessary security risk to aid workers. EISF would like to hear from your organisation if CTF has affected the security of your staff and/or operations.

In response to civil society concerns, the global standard setting body for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorist financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), revised its approach in October 2016 to reflect civil society organisations’ concerns.\n\nCharities had originally been classified as ‘particularly vulnerable’ to abuse by terrorists by FATF, although this classification was recently removed. The abuse that FATF and others have been concerned about can take various forms: from fake NGOs to legitimate organisations being defrauded to acquire or channel money. Partners or suppliers might also be set up or abused by terrorists. The rules are intended to make organisations take reasonable steps to check that funds are not being diverted. It is important for an NGO (as for any organisation) to demonstrate due diligence, meaning that they have good systems in place to detect terrorist financing. There is an obligation to report if an organisation suspects funds have been diverted to terrorists.\n\nIn this blog, I will briefly outline the security risks that aid workers can and have faced due to counter-terrorist financing measures, and go on to describe the international mechanism through which CTF measures are developed and evaluated. I will go on to outline the recent changes to CTF recommendations and what this might mean for humanitarian NGOs.\n\nWhat are the security concerns?\n\nNGOs have been affected by the way in which states and the private sector have implemented CTF standards, as recommended by FATF and each government’s own counter-terrorism policy advisors.

Some have completely stopped doing business with NGOs and local banks operating in these areas. This action is known as de-risking.</p>\n\n<p>If banks refuse to transfer funds, then some NGOs have opted to use cash couriers leading to the risk of robbery and harm to aid workers transporting cash. Others have started using the informal hawala system, which some NGOs have reported can cause security incidents.\nIt is ironic that the effects of this legislation often push NGOs into more marginal, riskier and less traceable forms of money transfer where it is more likely to be misappropriated on route to beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p>Beneficiary vetting</p>\n\n<p>Under some legislation, if any terrorist benefits from a service directly or indirectly, this can count as material support to a terrorist group. This could include food or emergency medical care. It has often been pointed out that this contradicts the humanitarian principles that state that aid should be given to all those in need.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of these laws, some banks expect aid organisations to know an unrealistic amount about their beneficiaries, to have a procedure in place to prevent this. Such requests also ignore the guidance from FATF that banks do not need to ‘know their customer’s customer’. Attempting to meet this expectation could be perceived as spying and can cause an NGO to use up scarce resources. Requiring more staff on the ground, for example, has security implications, especially in a conflict zone.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if an NGO attempts to meet this request by collecting lists of beneficiaries this could lead to host states asking to see such lists, potentially endangering beneficiaries or creating mistrust if the NGO refuses to share this information. This could affect an NGO’s local acceptance and therefore the security of aid staff operating in that geographical area.</p>\n\n<p>Security checks</p>\n\n<p>Some banks have instituted additional security checks before approving the transfer of funds, thus causing delays in implementation that can have serious implications for an NGO’s operational security. This delay can also be caused by an NGO not being fully prepared to answer the questions that some banks have posed in a timely manner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who makes the rules and what are the recent developments?</strong></p>\n\n<p>FATF is a global intergovernmental body set up to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It makes recommendations, which states then transpose into their own legislation. FATF has developed a series of recommendations that are recognised as the international standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these rules involve setting standards which the banking industry and other private and non-governmental groups must comply with. In 2016, as a result of advocacy by civil society, FATF revised its recommendation in relation to the non-profit sector and accordingly updated its mutual evaluation methodology, which is used to assess how well countries are implementing these rules.\nIn June 2016, after consultation with the non-profit sector, FATF revised its Recommendation 8 and related interpretive note, which relates to non-profit organisations specifically. The body changed the wording of the recommendation so non-profit organisations were no longer considered ‘particularly vulnerable’ to terrorist financing schemes.\nFurthermore, in October 2016, the mutual evaluation methodology was also updated by FATF. Mutual evaluations are one of FATF’s main sources of leverage. Bad mutual evaluation scores can lead to a country’s banks being cut off from the international financial system. The most significant changes made to the guidance for evaluation assessors are as follows:\nSupervision of non-profits should focus on those that the country’s government has identified as being at risk of terrorist financing abuse rather than the whole sector. The guidance now emphasises that such supervision should be ‘focused and proportionate’.\nAssessors will now consider whether ‘legitimate charitable activities are not disrupted or discouraged’ by measures put in place to counter terrorist financing.\nEvaluations take about 18 months and ongoing evaluations will continue to use the old criteria. Therefore, it will take some time to see how effective the changes are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The changes made by FATF, whilst very significant, are just a first step and will not necessarily lead to automatic changes in national rules. However, there is increasing awareness of the negative effects CTF has had on civil society organisations, particularly those NGOs operating in high terrorism risk areas. For example, in the UK, a working group is being set up between the government and NGOs; Chatham House has published research on the contradictions between CTF/counter-terrorism and international humanitarian law; and Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) are also researching this topic.</p>\n\n<p>Robust rules must be in place to counter financing of terrorism but these rules should not stop aid reaching the millions of victims of terrorism and conflict. Organisations need to be able to securely finance humanitarian operations in a way that minimises unnecessary security risk to aid workers.\nEISF would like to hear from your organisation if CTF has affected the security of your staff and/or operations.

Carel	Prosper Marketplace	Organization	https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/12/10/prospers-loan-to-terrorist-puts-alternative.html	Financial technology leaders in New York City are keeping calm after learning that Prosper Marketplace lent over $28,000 to the husband and wife who earlier this month killed 14 people in an act of terrorism in San Bernardino, California.  Initially, the unwitting role Prosper played in the terror attack raised a number of concerns in the financial community about whether the loan was evidence of a lax regulatory environment surrounding this new breed of startups that quickly puts borrowers directly in touch with non-bank lenders.  “It will definitely be a headline that will be used, I’m sure,” said Hans Morris, founder of Nyca Investment Capital and a past president of Visa. “For my standpoint, it doesn’t change the regulatory framework. You have to follow the rules and that’s the story."  Speaking at an industry breakfast this morning in Manhattan, Morris joined others on the panel who argued that existing regulations imposed on traditional banks and startups alike are sufficient. What worried other panelists though is that a push to increase the depth of background checks for loans might eventually violate a potential borrower’s right to privacy.  Prosper is a San Francisco-based lender that's raised $354 million venture capital to help borrowers find loans from nontraditional sources. The company lets its lenders browse loan applications, find listings they find desirable, and make loans as small as $25.  On Nov. 18, two weeks before the deadly attacks in San Bernardino, the company loaned over $28,000 to 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers. After performing its due-diligence the loan was originated by Salt Lake City-based Webbank.com, an online-only bank that specializes in originating loans for peer-to-peer transactions, including those arranged by publicly-traded Lending Club (NYSE: LC).  Prosper's role was revealed this week after authorities reported a large deposit had been made to Farook's bank account shortly before the attack. The loan has put not just Prosper on the defensive, but also other alternative lenders who are examining their own lending procedures.  At this morning's breakfast planned before the Dec. 2 attacks took place, Morris and several New York City-based financial technology founders weighed in on the question of whether marketplace lenders need additional oversight. The consensus was that the level of regulation marketplace lenders were expected to follow was at least equal to that of banks.  David Klein, cofounder and CEO of marketplace lending platform CommonBond, said his firm has a multi-tiered identification verification process on all its loans and that every marketplace lender is subject—in principle—to the same regulatory requirements.  But in a conversation after the breakfast, he explained that in reality, regulatory considerations are more nuanced across different asset classes. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has student loan examination guidelines that are subtly different than those for mortgages, cars, and other types of loans.  For someone who intends to take out a loan for an illicit or illegal act the most likely type of loan is a personal loan which is generally dispersed directly to the recipient. Other loans for education or to refinance are disbursed directly to the school or existing lender respectively. “So a lot of the fraud detection is already build in,” said Klein  And so, it's for personal loans that marketplace lenders like CommonBond require verification above that of even many traditional banks by requiring a borrower's bank account information. The data is cross-referenced with third-party databases like account aggregators Yodlee or Plaid to make sure everything matches up.  At this stage of the investigation many of the details of the loan have not been released to the press, including what type of loan was given. According to Klein, “The only answer we’ve been able to find so far is that everything was done by the books and whether this happened at Prosper or JP Morgan, you would have the same outcome,” he said.  Alex Sion, co-founder of alt-banking company Moven, said his consumer-focused company actually requires a higher barrier to entry than a traditional bank to get a credit card. “Most of us do more than physically centered lenders or banks,” said Sion, who is also the company's president. “It would be a bad place if we got to this point where we’re starting to question digital progress because of one incident.”  Up until this attack, the conventional wisdom surrounding how terrorists got funds for their acts focused on traditional banks, old-fashioned gold and cutting-edge cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In March, the House Committee on Financial Services announced the creation of a bipartisan task force to investigate terrorism financing with a goal to shut down illicit banks. Then in May, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a report suggesting that terrorists were moving to gold as a result of clamping down on traditional banks.  And last month, after terrorists connected to the Islamic State (ISIS) mounted coordinated attacks in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, the European Commission released a memo outlining plans to assess the role bitcoin may have played, according to a Coinbase report. Earlier this week finance ministers in the European Union announced plans to create centralized bank-account registers to make it easier for police to investigate terrorist funding in traditional banks.  Klein's biggest concern is that those in the United States who want to see deeper background checks might push for an increased level of scrutiny that could eventually lead to privacy violations. If there's a way to increase security that doesn't violate the “principles and philosophy of this country” Klein says he welcomes change. Otherwise, regulators inspired by this event should tread lightly.  "Do you, do I, do we want the government to look at our Google searches?" he asked. "You could argue they do right now — but use Google searches for credit decisions? I think in this country in particular, that’s a really slippery slope and that’s what I think makes this question a good question to ask. My hope is that it goes in a positive and productive direction."  Already today, The House Financial Services Committee began an inquiry to look into whether marketplace lending needed additional regulation, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  Jon Stein, CEO of New York City-based robo-advising firm Betterment, closed out the panel by shifting the focus away from financial regulation altogether.  “I would see it as a real lack of leadership," Stein said, "and a lack of good vision and narrative if what we took away from this was that the problem is access to capital, rather than the access to firearms."

You have to follow the rules and that’s the story."</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at an industry breakfast this morning in Manhattan, Morris joined others on the panel who argued that existing regulations imposed on traditional banks and startups alike are sufficient. What worried other panelists though is that a push to increase the depth of background checks for loans might eventually violate a potential borrower’s right to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Prosper is a San Francisco-based lender that\'s raised $354 million venture capital to help borrowers find loans from nontraditional sources. The company lets its lenders browse loan applications, find listings they find desirable, and make loans as small as $25.</p>\n\n<p>On Nov. 18, two weeks before the deadly attacks in San Bernardino, the company loaned over $28,000 to 28-year-old <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/search/results?q=Syed%20Rizwan%20Farook">Syed Rizwan Farook</a>, one of the attackers. After performing its due-diligence the loan was originated by Salt Lake City-based Webbank.com, an online-only bank that specializes in originating loans for peer-to-peer transactions, including those arranged by publicly-traded Lending Club (NYSE: LC).<br></p>\n\n<p>Prosper\'s role was revealed this week after authorities reported a large deposit had been made to Farook\'s bank account shortly before the attack. The loan has put not just Prosper on the defensive, but also other alternative lenders who are examining their own lending procedures.</p>\n\n<p>At this morning\'s breakfast planned before the Dec. 2 attacks took place, Morris and several New York City-based financial technology founders weighed in on the question of whether marketplace lenders need additional oversight. The consensus was that the level of regulation marketplace lenders were expected to follow was at least equal to that of banks.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/search/results?q=David%20Klein">David Klein</a>, cofounder and CEO of marketplace lending platform CommonBond, said his firm has a multi-tiered identification verification process on all its loans and that every marketplace lender is subject—in principle—to the same regulatory requirements.</p>\n\n<p>But in a conversation after the breakfast, he explained that in reality, regulatory considerations are more nuanced across different asset classes. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has student loan examination guidelines that are subtly different than those for mortgages, cars, and other types of loans.</p>\n\n<p>For someone who intends to take out a loan for an illicit or illegal act the most likely type of loan is a personal loan which is generally dispersed directly to the recipient. Other loans for education or to refinance are disbursed directly to the school or existing lender respectively. “So a lot of the fraud detection is already build in,” said Klein</p>\n\n<p>And so, it\'s for personal loans that marketplace lenders like CommonBond require verification above that of even many traditional banks by requiring a borrower\'s bank account information. The data is cross-referenced with third-party databases like account aggregators Yodlee or Plaid to make sure everything matches up.</p>\n\n<p>At this stage of the investigation many of the details of the loan have not been released to the press, including what type of loan was given. According to Klein, “The only answer we’ve been able to find so far is that everything was done by the books and whether this happened at Prosper or JP Morgan, you would have the same outcome,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Alex Sion, co-founder of alt-banking company Moven, said his consumer-focused company actually requires a higher barrier to entry than a traditional bank to get a credit card. “Most of us do more than physically centered lenders or banks,” said Sion, who is also the company\'s president. “It would be a bad place if we got to this point where we’re starting to question digital progress because of one incident.”</p>\n\n<p>Up until this attack, the conventional wisdom surrounding how terrorists got funds for their acts focused on traditional banks, old-fashioned gold and cutting-edge cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In March, the House Committee on Financial Services announced the <a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/four-pressing-issues-in-combatting-terrorism-financing-1076102-1.html">creation of a bipartisan task force to investigate terrorism financing</a> with a goal to shut down illicit banks.

Carel	Securities and Exchange Commission	Organization	https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/what_can_you_do_to_avoid_investment_fraud	A little cynicism can go a long way to protect yourself from fraud.  Millions of people become victims of countless forms of fraud each year. Scott Matteson, educator with Michigan State University Extension, says that, “Criminals use the phone, email, postal mail and the internet to lure you into sending money, purchasing products or investments, or giving out personal information.” There are always new ways criminals try to get their hands on your money, so it’s important to know some basic facts about the fraud.  What can you do to avoid investment fraud?  The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission suggest that consumers should take the following steps to avoid investment fraud:  Ask questions and do your own research. For more about information, see Ask Questions. You can also check out many investments by searching EDGAR. Know the salesperson. Always find out whether the securities salespeople who contact you are licensed to sell securities in your state and whether they or their firms have had run-ins with regulators or other investors. You can check out the disciplinary history of brokers and advisers for free using the SEC’s and FINRA’s online databases. Your state securities regulator may have additional information. Be suspicious of unsolicited offers. It could be a “ pump and dump ” scheme or affinity fraud. As you have heard, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself online. For tips on how to do this, see Protect Your Social Media Accounts.  The Financial Fraud and Fraud Susceptibility in the United States research report prepared by Applied Research & Consulting LLC says that financial fraud solicitations are common, it is difficult for most consumers to identify the classic red flags of fraud and older people face the greatest risk from investment fraud.  Take a moment to use the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s Risk Meter to see if you may be vulnerable to investment fraud.  If you have a question or concern about an investment, or you think you have been a victim of fraud, please contact the SEC or your state securities regulator to report the fraud and to get assistance.

Carel	Larry Householder	Individual	https://www.limaohio.com/news/158101/ex-ohio-house-speaker-wouldnt-run-unopposed-in-comeback	COLUMBUS (AP) — Any potential comeback by ex-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder won’t go unchallenged.  The once-powerful Republican said last week that unfinished business on policy matters has him considering a return run for the district including his Perry County home.  In a district where the winner of the Republican primary will almost certainly land the seat, a three-way GOP primary is shaping up. Coshocton City Council President Cliff Biggers is already running and a second GOP contender, local businessman Randal Almendinger, is circulating petitions.  Both Almendinger and Householder have until Dec. 16 to file.  High interest in the seat shows top Republicans aren’t clearing the way for Householder’s victory. Supporters have said Householder would bring valuable skill and experience to the Statehouse, but his detractors say he led an era of heavy-handed politics that shouldn’t be repeated.  Householder, 56, left Columbus a decade ago amid a federal investigation into allegations of money laundering and irregular campaign practices.  An anonymous, nine-page memo leaked to the FBI, IRS and then-Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in 2004 accused the House Republican Campaign Committee that Householder oversaw of overpaying vendors, then having those vendors make secret payments back to Householder and his advisers.  Householder said at the time the memo contained “half-truths and outright lies.” After a two-year investigation, the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute.  If he runs, Householder would join a group of seasoned Republican lawmakers seeking to return to the House next year. They include Senate President Keith Faber and state Sens. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, Tom Patton of Cleveland, Jim Hughes of Columbus and possibly Chris Widener of Springfield.  All served under Householder when he was speaker, potentially giving him critical mass to seek another speakership. Householder insists he’s not going for the job.  He is, however, working to line up support for getting back to the Statehouse. Powerful retired lobbyist John Mahaney, of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said he supports the effort.  “Larry is a very hard-working, loyal guy. I thought he did a nice job as speaker,” he said. “His staff didn’t do him any favors, but he himself certainly was four-square with me. His word was his bond, as I prided myself at having mine be over the years. Also, we’re a couple of hillbillies — him from Glenford, me from Zanesville — so we got along.”  Mahaney noted some storied Ohio politicians — including late Republican Gov. James Rhodes and the late Democratic House Speaker Vern Riffe — hailed from Appalachia. But the district Householder is eyeing has been redrawn to be more urban and less rural since Householder last served, so it’s unclear whether it would be so easy to win.  Biggers, who is black, may attract campaign and financial help from his party since he would lend some desired diversity to the nearly all-white House Republican caucus. He is a retired police detective and pastor of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Coshocton.  Almendinger is a Republican party insider well-known in Licking County, where he owns newspapers, a commercial cleaning company and a real estate company and has served in public roles including school board and township trustee.  Householder has served as Perry County commissioner and auditor. He was speaker from 2001 to 2004.

Carel	Stephen Baldwin	Individual	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/31/stephen-baldwin-interview	Stephen Baldwin, 43, has 18 tattoos. "They represent various moments in my life," he says. "Whether it be showing my love for my woman in a very macho way – there are three of those – to the ones which express my commitment to sobriety. I have one for my children. The 3.30 one on the back of my neck is the time I'm supposed to be home! No, it's a scripture in the Bible that I feel compelled to remind myself of: John 3.30. "I must decrease so that he may increase." It's about consciousness of humility. I'm walking this walk and my life has nothing to do with my perception of the world. It's all God! How do I function within His plan?"  How, indeed? Nestled amid these lofty body adornments, at the top of Stephen's left shoulder, are two small letters: HM. They stand for… Hannah Montana. Miley Cyrus joked that she would get him a cameo in her Hannah Montana series if he got the tattoo and Stephen, a man who relishes a challenge, went straight out and did it.  "Hey, it's just one more," he shrugs. "And I have a beverage company that produces an energy shot, a Red Bull-type drink, called Hit Me. So I can say that the HM stands for Hit Me. Hit me! I'm fuelled on adrenaline with a chaser of the Holy Ghost! Yeeeeah!"  Stephen Baldwin is a character. Even his tattoos are bananas. The youngest and, some say, dumbest of the Baldwin brothers is a pumped-up ball of energy, a glitter-eyed alpha male, a charismatic Christian, a proper laugh. He charms everyone that wanders into his light. When he drops off his washing at a Camden launderette – "How are you all today, ladies?" – he has the manageress eating out of his hand. "Some of these nice jumpers we'll have to keep out of the tumble dryer," she offers; she has no idea who he is. But her young nephew, who's wearing a hoodie emblazoned with Playboy Mansion Security, is thrilled to see the Celebrity Big Brother star. Stephen beckons him over.  "Hey buddy," he stage whispers. "I've been to four of those Playboy parties. And you know what? They weren't so great." The lad flushes pink with excitement.  It's the Sunday after Stephen's Friday-night eviction from the Big Brother house. He's not had much sleep since: after the show, he went out with Sisqo, his fellow evictee, to Old Compton Street tourist trap Balans, of all places, where they hooked up with CBB ex-housemates Lady Sovereign and Kat. Then, last night, he trekked to an internet cafe at 3am so he could co-host his religious radio programme, Baldwin/McCullough Xtreme Radio, which goes out live every Saturday evening to 195 stations across the US. He didn't go to sleep until six in the morning.  Still, there's not much evidence of tiredness when we meet, in the restaurant of his hotel. It's nearly noon and Stephen is running late for his appearance on Big Brother's Little Brother. He avails himself of the breakfast buffet at a leisurely pace. "The car they've sent has a flat tyre," says the PR, "so we're OK for a few minutes." Stephen says: "See this? This is MOR-TA-DEL-LA. We need to make time for this."  There is an enormous Bible on the table. Stephen takes it everywhere; he specified in his Big Brother contract that he be allowed to read it for an hour a day while in the house, despite there usually being a blanket ban on reading material.  "I ain't going in the House of Hell without my sword!" he trumpets. "I only look stupid… And there wasn't much to do, so guess what? The Bible readings became a big thing! I'm like, 'Wait a minute: I'm not holding a Bible study class while the whole world watches, am I?' I spoke with everyone about God, except for Vinnie."  Actually, Stephen – Stevie B, as he refers to himself – is convinced that he saw the devil while he was in Big Brother, working from within two of the housemates. (He won't tell me which, though I'd guess at mild Nicola T and dimbo Dane Bowers, both remarkably undemonic.) Whatever, the devil popped up and Stevie B spotted the ­little rascal.  "Demons manifest themselves in people in different ways," he says seriously. "For instance, out of nowhere, somebody can become very angry for no ­reason. That's not just an emotion. That's a demon."  Stephen tried to talk about this with other housemates, but they didn't seem that bothered that some of their members were possessed. So he consulted with God, and came to this conclusion: the Holy Spirit is allowing Stephen to see certain things… "BUT! If I mentioned it, it would destroy my credibility in the house. Satan would be using my knowledge that he exists against me! I can't reveal the truth! This," muses Stephen, "is gnarly warfare."  "Give me 120 seconds," he says to the PR and nips over to talk to two British people that he met in the hotel lobby yesterday. They're from Yorkshire and invite him to accompany them to see Leeds replay Tottenham in the FA Cup in a few days' time. "Sure!" says Stephen. He has spoken, and so it shall be.  We take a cab to the Big Brother house, in Elstree. On the way, Stephen talks about his family. Born in a small town on Long Island, New York, he's one of six children – two girls, Elizabeth and Jane, and four now-famous boys: Alec, Billy, Danny, Stephen. Their Catholic parents were respected community members – his dad was a schoolteacher, his mum founded a breast cancer care centre – and the Baldwin brothers were popular: "Badly behaved, outspoken, famous-in-our-town, dumb jocks." Stephen was the baby, his mum's favourite: "Like Michael Jackson in the Jackson 5 years, with confidence in my charm and a belief in my ability to be entertaining."  Alec, then and now the leader of the Baldwins, became president of his school's student body, followed by Billy and Jane. He studied acting at NYU and, in 1980, Alec got a role in a daytime soap called The ­Doctors. The other boys ­followed, landing modelling and acting jobs through, says Stephen, "chutzpah, personality, drive and a belief that anything's achievable". Everything came easily to the confident ­Baldwin ­brothers.  Up until he found the Lord, Stephen worked pretty solidly as an actor, his ­biggest roles being in mid-90s ­movies The Usual Suspects and Bio-Dome; though he nearly blew his career early on, by getting heavily involved with ­alcohol and cocaine. He first took coke at his high school prom. But he was clean and out of rehab by the age of 23, having met his Brazilian wife, Kennya, when he was 19. They married in 1990 and have two girls, Alaia, who's just turned 17, and Hailey, 13.  Kennya has been instrumental in Stephen's conversion from Catholicism to born-again Christian. When Alaia was first born, Kennya hired a Brazilian woman, Augusta, as a housekeeper. As she worked, Augusta kept singing about Jesus and Kennya asked why: Augusta replied that her local church in Brazil had told her that she should take the job with the Baldwins because, if she did, they would become believers and have their own ministry. Kennya told Stephen. He laughed.  Some time later, Kennya became born again. "I gave my life to the Lord tonight, she said," remembers Stephen. "I said, 'That's awesome.'" But it involved more than he expected: every day Kennya would get up and pray silently for two hours, her face pressed to the floor. She did the same thing every night, as well as study her Bible for 45 ­minutes. After around nine months, Stephen joined in, though he didn't really feel the force until 9/11 and the collapse of the Twin Towers.  "I live in New York. And I thought, 'What's up with that?' It was the prophetic, supernatural, spiritual impact of 9/11. Something shifting for no logical reason – well, then, Jesus Christ could come back for real. Things are no longer as they were before. Now the impossible is possible. And if the impossible is possible, and a woman came and told my wife that we would lead a ministry…"  Stephen was convinced that 9/11 was a sign from the Lord. Which it may have been, though it's hard to believe that God caused all that tragedy just to inform one fairly successful actor that he should jack in his career and start skateboarding for Jesus. But anyway, Stephen set up a company called Global Breakthrough Ministry and staged a very popular arena tour around the US, which mixed extreme sports and evangelism. A spin-off video called Livin It, which he directed, has gone on to sell 500,000 copies.  Opportunities kept coming: he did a tour of churches, hooked up with Kevin McCullough and started his radio show, wrote two books, set up an outreach service to help members of the US armed forces. Over the past few years, however, he says he's tried to calm down and listen to the Lord more – and this, weirdly, has led him to do a series of reality shows in the US, including I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here, which he hated, and Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge, which he enjoyed.  We arrive at the Big Brother studio, where Sisqo and Stephen partake gamely in BBLB, with George Lamb taking the mickey out of them throughout. Both Americans are great performers; funny, reactive, quick to get the joke. "Do I love bootleg jeans? Sure I do," booms Stephen, and flips up his trouser hem to reveal his iPhone tucked into his sock. "I'm from New York! It's a great place to hide a small 38 revolver!"  Stephen got £150,000 for the show. Which sounds a lot, but he went bankrupt last year, owing $824,488.36 in unpaid mortgage and an unspecified amount, believed to be over $2m, to the IRS: "I didn't plan for a rainy day. I didn't know the Jesus freak thing was on the horizon!" A casting director told him recently that he'd been put up for three different films, but each time, the director said no, specifically because Stephen can't keep quiet about his faith. Anyway, he tells me, he can't do the films he used to, because of the gratuitous violence, bad language and sex. If he were offered The Usual Suspects today – which is unlikely – he would have to say no.  Off we go again, this time to Nigel Hall on Floral Street, where a stylist whizzes Stephen in and out of some nice clothes. (He can't be that skint: the discount comes to over £1,500.) Stephen is a laugh throughout. "Take a picture!" he says, and organises it so he's in the best light. "My wife will rape me in this outfit. Rape. Me." He keeps ­telling me not to quote him when he uses what he thinks is louche language, such as "balls": being a Christian, for him as for many Americans, means he has to stick to a rigidly conservative agenda. It impacts directly on his life: his father-in-law, who divorced Kennya's mum nine years ago, is not allowed in Stephen's house with his girlfriend. It would be OK if they were married, but until that happens, "until he is acting in a way we feel acceptable according to our faith", then no.  Our final stop is a small shop in ­Kensington, where a service for the Every Nation Church is being held. Earnest, smiley young people sit on cushions to hear their pastor speak. They sit a lot longer for Stephen's talk: once he starts, he can't stop, telling them the story of his conversion, dragging it out for giggles, relishing his chance to speak freely about his faith without Vinnie Jones butting in. It's 45 minutes of fun. Stephen is a remarkably likable man, I think.  But then, the day after, we speak again on the phone and I ask him what he'd do if one of his girls came out as a lesbian and the other became a stripper. "Jesus or no Jesus, if my kid started working in a strip club, I'd beat her ass," he hoots. "Now, the other question is interesting and culturally relevant. I have two or three very dear friends who are homosexual and they know I'm born again and we have an understanding that we're just not going there…"  I'm not surprised. For the next 20 minutes, we have an intense discussion – argument, really – during which Stephen reveals that he's all for gay men who, through their faith, reject their homosexuality and get married: "To turn away from that lifestyle is astonishing." Yes, Stephen, it is. And he's definitely not for gay marriage.  What about civil partnerships, I ask wearily.  "I believe that the family unit has fundamentally been the most positive thing for society and I don't believe that any minority has the right to create changes that impact on the majority. That's really the only issue for me."  And so Stephen and I part company, both feeling disappointed in each other. It's a shame, but it's one of those things.

"They represent various moments in my life," he says. "Whether it be showing my love for my woman in a very macho way – there are three of those – to the ones which express my commitment to sobriety. I have one for my children. The 3.30 one on the back of my neck is the time I\'m supposed to be home! No, it\'s a scripture in the Bible that I feel compelled to remind myself of: John 3.30. "I must decrease so that he may increase." It\'s about consciousness of humility. I\'m walking this walk and my life has nothing to do with my perception of the world. It\'s all God! How do I function within His plan?"\n\nHow, indeed? Nestled amid these lofty body adornments, at the top of Stephen\'s left shoulder, are two small letters: HM. They stand for… Hannah Montana. Miley Cyrus joked that she would get him a cameo in her Hannah Montana series if he got the tattoo and Stephen, a man who relishes a challenge, went straight out and did it.\n\n"Hey, it\'s just one more," he shrugs. "And I have a beverage company that produces an energy shot, a Red Bull-type drink, called Hit Me. So I can say that the HM stands for Hit Me. Hit me! I\'m fuelled on adrenaline with a chaser of the Holy Ghost! Yeeeeah!"\n\nStephen Baldwin is a character. Even his tattoos are bananas. The youngest and, some say, dumbest of the Baldwin brothers is a pumped-up ball of energy, a glitter-eyed alpha male, a charismatic Christian, a proper laugh. He charms everyone that wanders into his light. When he drops off his washing at a Camden launderette – "How are you all today, ladies?" – he has the manageress eating out of his hand. "Some of these nice jumpers we\'ll have to keep out of the tumble dryer," she offers; she has no idea who he is. But her young nephew, who\'s wearing a hoodie emblazoned with Playboy Mansion Security, is thrilled to see the Celebrity Big Brother star. Stephen beckons him over.\n\n"Hey buddy," he stage whispers. "I\'ve been to four of those Playboy parties. And you know what? They weren\'t so great." The lad flushes pink with excitement.\n\nIt\'s the Sunday after Stephen\'s Friday-night eviction from the Big Brother house. He\'s not had much sleep since: after the show, he went out with Sisqo, his fellow evictee, to Old Compton Street tourist trap Balans, of all places, where they hooked up with CBB ex-housemates Lady Sovereign and Kat. Then, last night, he trekked to an internet cafe at 3am so he could co-host his religious radio programme, Baldwin/McCullough Xtreme Radio, which goes out live every Saturday evening to 195 stations across the US. He didn\'t go to sleep until six in the morning.\n\nStill, there\'s not much evidence of tiredness when we meet, in the restaurant of his hotel. It\'s nearly noon and Stephen is running late for his appearance on Big Brother\'s Little Brother. He avails himself of the breakfast buffet at a leisurely pace. "The car they\'ve sent has a flat tyre," says the PR, "so we\'re OK for a few minutes." Stephen says: "See this? This is MOR-TA-DEL-LA. We need to make time for this."\n\nThere is an enormous Bible on the table. Stephen takes it everywhere; he specified in his Big Brother contract that he be allowed to read it for an hour a day while in the house, despite there usually being a blanket ban on reading material.\n\n"I ain\'t going in the House of Hell without my sword!" he trumpets. "I only look stupid… And there wasn\'t much to do, so guess what? The Bible readings became a big thing! I\'m like, \'Wait a minute: I\'m not holding a Bible study class while the whole world watches, am I?\' I spoke with everyone about God, except for Vinnie."\n\nActually, Stephen – Stevie B, as he refers to himself – is convinced that he saw the devil while he was in Big Brother, working from within two of the housemates. (He won\'t tell me which, though I\'d guess at mild Nicola T and dimbo Dane Bowers, both remarkably undemonic.) Whatever, the devil popped up and Stevie B spotted the \xadlittle rascal.\n\n"Demons manifest themselves in people in different ways," he says seriously. "For instance, out of nowhere, somebody can become very angry for no \xadreason. That\'s not just an emotion. That\'s a demon."\n\nStephen tried to talk about this with other housemates, but they didn\'t seem that bothered that some of their members were possessed. So he consulted with God, and came to this conclusion: the Holy Spirit is allowing Stephen to see certain things… "BUT! If I mentioned it, it would destroy my credibility in the house. Satan would be using my knowledge that he exists against me! I can\'t reveal the truth! This," muses Stephen, "is gnarly warfare."\n\n"Give me 120 seconds," he says to the PR and nips over to talk to two British people that he met in the hotel lobby yesterday. They\'re from Yorkshire and invite him to accompany them to see Leeds replay Tottenham in the FA Cup in a few days\' time. "Sure!" says Stephen. He has spoken, and so it shall be.\n\nWe take a cab to the Big Brother house, in Elstree. On the way, Stephen talks about his family. Born in a small town on Long Island, New York, he\'s one of six children – two girls, Elizabeth and Jane, and four now-famous boys: Alec, Billy, Danny, Stephen. Their Catholic parents were respected community members – his dad was a schoolteacher, his mum founded a breast cancer care centre – and the Baldwin brothers were popular: "Badly behaved, outspoken, famous-in-our-town, dumb jocks." Stephen was the baby, his mum\'s favourite: "Like Michael Jackson in the Jackson 5 years, with confidence in my charm and a belief in my ability to be entertaining."\n\nAlec, then and now the leader of the Baldwins, became president of his school\'s student body, followed by Billy and Jane. He studied acting at NYU and, in 1980, Alec got a role in a daytime soap called The \xadDoctors. The other boys \xadfollowed, landing modelling and acting jobs through, says Stephen, "chutzpah, personality, drive and a belief that anything\'s achievable". Everything came easily to the confident \xadBaldwin \xadbrothers.\n\nUp until he found the Lord, Stephen worked pretty solidly as an actor, his \xadbiggest roles being in mid-90s \xadmovies The Usual Suspects and Bio-Dome; though he nearly blew his career early on, by getting heavily involved with \xadalcohol and cocaine. He first took coke at his high school prom. But he was clean and out of rehab by the age of 23, having met his Brazilian wife, Kennya, when he was 19. They married in 1990 and have two girls, Alaia, who\'s just turned 17, and Hailey, 13.\n\nKennya has been instrumental in Stephen\'s conversion from Catholicism to born-again Christian. When Alaia was first born, Kennya hired a Brazilian woman, Augusta, as a housekeeper. As she worked, Augusta kept singing about Jesus and Kennya asked why: Augusta replied that her local church in Brazil had told her that she should take the job with the Baldwins because, if she did, they would become believers and have their own ministry. Kennya told Stephen. He laughed.\n\nSome time later, Kennya became born again. "I gave my life to the Lord tonight, she said," remembers Stephen. "I said, \'That\'s awesome.\'" But it involved more than he expected: every day Kennya would get up and pray silently for two hours, her face pressed to the floor. She did the same thing every night, as well as study her Bible for 45 \xadminutes. After around nine months, Stephen joined in, though he didn\'t really feel the force until 9/11 and the collapse of the Twin Towers.\n\n"I live in New York. And I thought, \'What\'s up with that?\' It was the prophetic, supernatural, spiritual impact of 9/11. Something shifting for no logical reason – well, then, Jesus Christ could come back for real. Things are no longer as they were before. Now the impossible is possible. And if the impossible is possible, and a woman came and told my wife that we would lead a ministry…"\n\nStephen was convinced that 9/11 was a sign from the Lord. Which it may have been, though it\'s hard to believe that God caused all that tragedy just to inform one fairly successful actor that he should jack in his career and start skateboarding for Jesus. But anyway, Stephen set up a company called Global Breakthrough Ministry and staged a very popular arena tour around the US, which mixed extreme sports and evangelism. A spin-off video called Livin It, which he directed, has gone on to sell 500,000 copies.\n\nOpportunities kept coming: he did a tour of churches, hooked up with Kevin McCullough and started his radio show, wrote two books, set up an outreach service to help members of the US armed forces. Over the past few years, however, he says he\'s tried to calm down and listen to the Lord more – and this, weirdly, has led him to do a series of reality shows in the US, including I\'m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here, which he hated, and Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge, which he enjoyed.\n\nWe arrive at the Big Brother studio, where Sisqo and Stephen partake gamely in BBLB, with George Lamb taking the mickey out of them throughout. Both Americans are great performers; funny, reactive, quick to get the joke. "Do I love bootleg jeans? Sure I do," booms Stephen, and flips up his trouser hem to reveal his iPhone tucked into his sock. "I\'m from New York! It\'s a great place to hide a small 38 revolver!"\n\nStephen got £150,000 for the show. Which sounds a lot, but he went bankrupt last year, owing $824,488.36 in unpaid mortgage and an unspecified amount, believed to be over $2m, to the IRS: "I didn\'t plan for a rainy day. I didn\'t know the Jesus freak thing was on the horizon!" A casting director told him recently that he\'d been put up for three different films, but each time, the director said no, specifically because Stephen can\'t keep quiet about his faith. Anyway, he tells me, he can\'t do the films he used to, because of the gratuitous violence, bad language and sex. If he were offered The Usual Suspects today – which is unlikely – he would have to say no.\n\nOff we go again, this time to Nigel Hall on Floral Street, where a stylist whizzes Stephen in and out of some nice clothes. (He can\'t be that skint: the discount comes to over £1,500.) Stephen is a laugh throughout. "Take a picture!" he says, and organises it so he\'s in the best light. "My wife will rape me in this outfit. Rape. Me." He keeps \xadtelling me not to quote him when he uses what he thinks is louche language, such as "balls": being a Christian, for him as for many Americans, means he has to stick to a rigidly conservative agenda. It impacts directly on his life: his father-in-law, who divorced Kennya\'s mum nine years ago, is not allowed in Stephen\'s house with his girlfriend. It would be OK if they were married, but until that happens, "until he is acting in a way we feel acceptable according to our faith", then no.\n\nOur final stop is a small shop in \xadKensington, where a service for the Every Nation Church is being held. Earnest, smiley young people sit on cushions to hear their pastor speak. They sit a lot longer for Stephen\'s talk: once he starts, he can\'t stop, telling them the story of his conversion, dragging it out for giggles, relishing his chance to speak freely about his faith without Vinnie Jones butting in. It\'s 45 minutes of fun. Stephen is a remarkably likable man, I think.\n\nBut then, the day after, we speak again on the phone and I ask him what he\'d do if one of his girls came out as a lesbian and the other became a stripper. "Jesus or no Jesus, if my kid started working in a strip club, I\'d beat her ass," he hoots. "Now, the other question is interesting and culturally relevant. I have two or three very dear friends who are homosexual and they know I\'m born again and we have an understanding that we\'re just not going there…"\n\nI\'m not surprised. For the next 20 minutes, we have an intense discussion – argument, really – during which Stephen reveals that he\'s all for gay men who, through their faith, reject their homosexuality and get married: "To turn away from that lifestyle is astonishing." Yes, Stephen, it is. And he\'s definitely not for gay marriage.\n\nWhat about civil partnerships, I ask wearily.\n\n"I believe that the family unit has fundamentally been the most positive thing for society and I don\'t believe that any minority has the right to create changes that impact on the majority. That\'s really the only issue for me."\n\nAnd so Stephen and I part company, both feeling disappointed in each other. It\'s a shame, but it\'s one of those things. You can really like someone, but when you disagree so decisively on the way you should treat others, you can never really be friends.

Stephen beckons him over.</p>\n\n<p>"Hey buddy," he stage whispers. "I\'ve been to four of those <em>Playboy</em> parties. And you know what? They weren\'t so\xa0great." The lad flushes pink with excitement.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s the Sunday after Stephen\'s Friday-night eviction from the Big Brother house. He\'s not had much sleep since: after the show, he went out with Sisqo, his fellow evictee, to Old Compton Street tourist trap Balans, of all places, where they hooked up with <em>CBB</em> ex-housemates Lady Sovereign and Kat. Then, last night, he trekked to an internet cafe at 3am so he could co-host his religious radio programme, <em>Baldwin/McCullough Xtreme Radio</em>, which goes out live every Saturday evening to 195 stations across the US. He didn\'t go to sleep until six in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there\'s not much evidence of tiredness when we meet, in the restaurant of his hotel. It\'s nearly noon and Stephen is running late for his appearance on <em>Big Brother\'s Little Brother</em>. He avails himself of the breakfast buffet at a leisurely pace. "The car they\'ve sent has a flat tyre," says the PR, "so we\'re OK for a few minutes." Stephen says: "See this? This is MOR-TA-DEL-LA. We need to make time for this."</p>\n\n<p>There is an enormous Bible on the table. Stephen takes it everywhere; he specified in his <em>Big Brother</em> contract that he be allowed to read it for an hour a day while in the house, despite there usually being a blanket ban on reading material.</p>\n\n<p>"I ain\'t going in the House of Hell without my sword!" he trumpets. "I only <em>look</em> stupid… And there wasn\'t much to do, so guess what? The Bible readings became a big thing! I\'m like, \'Wait a minute: I\'m not holding a Bible study class while the whole world watches, am I?\' I spoke with everyone about God, except for Vinnie."</p>\n\n<p>Actually, Stephen – Stevie B, as he refers to himself – is convinced that he saw the devil while he was in <em>Big Brother</em>, working from within two of the housemates. (He won\'t tell me which, though I\'d guess at mild Nicola T and dimbo Dane Bowers, both remarkably undemonic.) Whatever, the devil popped up and Stevie B spotted the \xadlittle rascal.</p>\n\n<p>"Demons manifest themselves in people in different ways," he says seriously. "For instance, out of nowhere, somebody can become very angry for no \xadreason. That\'s not just an emotion. That\'s a demon."</p>\n\n<p>Stephen tried to talk about this with other housemates, but they didn\'t seem that bothered that some of their members were possessed. So he consulted with God, and came to this conclusion: the Holy Spirit is allowing Stephen to see certain things… "BUT! If I mentioned it, it would destroy my credibility in the house. Satan would be using my knowledge that he exists against me! I can\'t reveal the truth! This," muses Stephen, "is gnarly warfare."</p>\n\n<p>"Give me 120 seconds," he says to the PR and nips over to talk to two British people that he met in the hotel lobby yesterday. They\'re from Yorkshire and invite him to accompany them to see Leeds replay Tottenham in the FA Cup in a few days\' time. "Sure!" says Stephen. He has spoken, and so it shall be.</p>\n\n<p>We take a cab to the Big Brother house, in Elstree. On the way, Stephen talks about his family. Born in a small town on Long Island, New York, he\'s one of six children – two girls, Elizabeth and Jane, and four now-famous boys: Alec, Billy, Danny, Stephen. Their Catholic parents were respected community members – his dad was a schoolteacher, his mum founded a breast cancer care centre – and the Baldwin brothers were popular: "Badly behaved, outspoken, famous-in-our-town, dumb jocks." Stephen was the baby, his mum\'s favourite: "Like Michael Jackson in the Jackson 5 years, with confidence in my charm and a belief in my ability to be entertaining."</p>\n\n<p>Alec, then and now the leader of the Baldwins, became president of his school\'s student body, followed by Billy and Jane. He studied acting at NYU and, in 1980, Alec got a role in a daytime soap called <em>The \xadDoctors</em>. The other boys \xadfollowed, landing modelling and acting jobs through, says Stephen, "chutzpah, personality, drive and a belief that anything\'s achievable". Everything came easily to the confident\xa0\xadBaldwin\xa0\xadbrothers.</p>\n\n<p>Up until he found the Lord, Stephen worked pretty solidly as an actor, his \xadbiggest roles being in mid-90s \xadmovies <em>The Usual Suspects</em> and <em>Bio-Dome</em>; though he nearly blew his career early on, by getting heavily involved with \xadalcohol and cocaine. He first took coke at his high school prom. But he was clean and out of rehab by the age of 23, having met his Brazilian wife, Kennya, when he was 19. They married in 1990 and have\xa0two girls, Alaia, who\'s just turned\xa017, and\xa0Hailey, 13.</p>\n\n<p>Kennya has been instrumental in Stephen\'s conversion from Catholicism to born-again Christian. When Alaia was first born, Kennya hired a Brazilian woman, Augusta, as a housekeeper. As she worked, Augusta kept singing about Jesus and Kennya asked why: Augusta replied that her local church in Brazil had told her that she should take the job with the Baldwins because, if she did, they would become believers and have their own ministry. Kennya told Stephen. He laughed.</p>\n\n<p>Some time later, Kennya became born\xa0again. "I gave my life to the Lord tonight, she said," remembers Stephen. "I said, \'That\'s awesome.\'" But it involved more than he expected: every day Kennya would get up and pray silently for two hours, her face pressed to the floor. She did the same thing every night, as \xa0well as study her Bible for 45 \xadminutes. After around nine months, Stephen\xa0joined in,\xa0though he didn\'t really feel the force\xa0until 9/11 and the collapse of the Twin Towers.</p>\n\n<p>"I live in New York. And I thought, \'What\'s up with that?\' It was the prophetic, supernatural, spiritual impact of 9/11. Something shifting for no logical reason – well, then, Jesus Christ could come back for real. Things are no longer as they were before. Now the impossible is possible. And if the impossible is possible, and a woman came and told my wife that we would lead a ministry…"</p>\n\n<p>Stephen was convinced that 9/11 was a sign from the Lord. Which it may have been, though it\'s hard to believe that God caused all that tragedy just to inform one fairly successful actor that he should jack in his career and start skateboarding for Jesus. But anyway, Stephen set up a company called Global Breakthrough Ministry and staged a very popular arena tour around the US, which mixed extreme sports and evangelism. A spin-off video called <em>Livin It</em>, which he directed, has gone on to sell 500,000 copies.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunities kept coming: he did a tour of churches, hooked up with Kevin McCullough and started his radio show, wrote two books, set up an outreach service to help members of the US armed forces. Over the past few years, however, he says he\'s tried to calm down and listen to the Lord more – and this, weirdly, has led him to do a series of reality shows in the US, including <em>I\'m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here</em>, which he hated, and <em>Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge</em>, which he enjoyed.</p>\n\n<p>We arrive at the <em>Big Brother </em>studio, where Sisqo and Stephen partake gamely in <em>BBLB</em>, with George Lamb taking the mickey out of them throughout. Both Americans are great performers; funny, reactive, quick to get the joke. "Do I love bootleg jeans? Sure I do," booms Stephen, and flips up his trouser hem to reveal his iPhone tucked into his sock. "I\'m from New York! It\'s a great place to hide a small 38 revolver!"</p>\n\n<p>Stephen got £150,000 for the show. Which sounds a lot, but he went bankrupt last year, owing $824,488.36 in unpaid mortgage and an unspecified amount, believed to be over $2m, to the IRS: "I didn\'t plan for a rainy day. I didn\'t know the Jesus freak thing was on the horizon!" A casting director told him recently that he\'d been put up for three different films, but each time, the director said no, specifically because Stephen can\'t keep quiet about his faith. Anyway, he tells me, he can\'t do the films he used to, because of the gratuitous violence, bad language and sex. If he were offered <em>The Usual Suspects</em> today – which is unlikely – he would have to say no.</p>\n\n<p>Off we go again, this time to Nigel Hall on Floral Street, where a stylist whizzes Stephen in and out of some nice clothes. (He can\'t be that skint: the discount comes to over £1,500.) Stephen is a laugh throughout. "Take a picture!" he says, and organises it so he\'s in the best light. "My wife will rape me in this outfit. Rape. Me." He keeps \xadtelling me not to quote him when he uses what he thinks is louche language, such as "balls": being a Christian, for him as for many Americans, means he has to stick to a rigidly conservative agenda. It impacts directly on his life: his father-in-law, who divorced Kennya\'s mum nine years ago, is not allowed in Stephen\'s house with his girlfriend. It would be OK if they were married, but until that happens, "until he is acting in a way we feel acceptable according to our faith", then no.</p>\n\n<p>Our final stop is a small shop in \xadKensington, where a service for the Every Nation Church is being held. Earnest, smiley young people sit on cushions to hear their pastor speak. They sit a lot longer for Stephen\'s talk: once he starts, he can\'t stop, telling them the story of his conversion, dragging it out for giggles, relishing his chance to speak freely about his faith without Vinnie Jones butting in. It\'s 45 minutes of fun. Stephen is a remarkably likable man, I\xa0think.</p>\n\n<p>But then, the day after, we speak again on the phone and I ask him what he\'d do if one of his girls came out as a lesbian and the other became a stripper. "Jesus or no Jesus, if my kid started working in a strip club, I\'d beat her ass," he hoots. "Now, the other question is interesting and culturally relevant. I have two or three very dear friends who are homosexual and they know I\'m born again and we have an understanding that we\'re just not going there…"</p>\n\n<p>I\'m not surprised. For the next 20 minutes, we have an intense discussion – argument, really – during which Stephen reveals that he\'s all for gay men who, through their faith, reject their homosexuality and get married: "To turn away from that lifestyle is astonishing." Yes, Stephen, it is. And he\'s definitely not for gay marriage.</p>\n\n<p>What about civil partnerships, I ask wearily.</p>\n\n<p>"I believe that the family unit has fundamentally been the most positive thing for society and I don\'t believe that any minority has the right to create changes that impact on the majority. That\'s really the only issue for me."</p>\n\n<p>And so Stephen and I part company, both feeling disappointed in each other. It\'s a shame, but it\'s one of those things. You can really like someone, but when you disagree so decisively on the way you should treat others, you can never really be friends. Honestly, what is it about American born-again Christians that\xa0makes them so intolerant? \xadWhatever\xa0happened to loving thy\xa0\xadneighbour?</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2010-02-01T12:20:48.000Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2010-01-31T00:07:58.000Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	man with tattoos explain	sebastien		Stephen Baldwin: 'Jesus or no Jesus, if my daughter started working in a strip club, I'd beat her ass'
Shakshi	Gaston Browne	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Browne	Gaston Alfonso Browne (born 9 February 1967) is the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He has been the islands' leader since 2014. Before entering politics, he was a banker and businessman.  Browne was born on 9 February 1967, in Villa/Point Area on the twin island of Antigua and Barbuda. [2] [3] His life as a teenager was extremely tough. As a child, he lived in Gray's Farm with his paternal great-grandmother, who was in her eighties, at the time, partially blind, poor and aging. After her passing, he later grew up in Point, another impoverished area. [2]  As a child, he attended the Villa Primary School and later the Princess Margaret School after successfully passing the nation's common entrance examination. After completing his secondary education, Gaston attended the City Banking College in the United Kingdom, where he graduated with a BSc in banking and finance. Later, he attended University of Manchester, acquiring an MBA in Finance. [4] [5] [6]  Career[ edit ]  Following graduation Browne secured a position with the Swiss American Banking Group, a major banking consortium in Antigua and Barbuda, comprising offshore and onshore banks and a trust company, eventually rising to the position of Commercial Banking Manager.  He entered the political arena in 1999, when he was elected to parliament for the constituency of St. John's City West. He was appointed Minister of Planning, Trade, Industry, Commerce and Public Service Affairs in his first term as an MP. [ citation needed ]  Prime Minister[ edit ]  Gaston Browne led the Antigua Labour Party to victory in the 12 June 2014 general election, after 10 years in opposition, winning 14 out of 17 seats. Browne was sworn in as Prime Minister on 13 June 2014. [7] He defeated Baldwin Spencer 's UPP, which had ruled for 10 years.  Aftermath of Hurricane Irma[ edit ]  On 6 September 2017 Hurricane Irma swept through Barbuda. Gaston Browne stated that the Category 5 storm had destroyed 95% of the structures and vehicles. [8] Initial estimates showed that at least 60% of the island's residents were homeless because of the disaster. [9] All communications with Barbuda were completely down for a time; most of the communications system had been destroyed. [10]  On 8 September 2017, Browne described the situation as follows during an interview. "Barbuda right now is literally a rubble" with no water or phone service; he said there had been only a single fatality. [11] The government had almost completed the evacuation of the entire island; nearly 1,800 people were transferred to Antigua. [12]  On the same day, the first of three cargo planes arrived from the US, with over 120,000 pounds of relief for Barbuda. The cost was covered by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and by donations from Martin Franklyn and the Coleman Company in the US. [13] Also on 8 September, Browne discussed Barbuda's urgent needs with Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for International Development. USAID had already sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team and would continue to coordinate with the government and relief organizations. [14]  Browne's government was facing a massive challenge. An estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Antigua and Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that "all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management". He summarised the situation as follows: "Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety ... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this." [15]  Browne is married to Maria Bird-Browne, niece of the second Prime Minister Lester Bird. [16] The couple have a son, Prince Gaston Browne, [5] who was Browne's fourth child, as he had three children prior to marriage. They had a second child, a daughter, in September 2020. [17]  On 11 December, it was announced that Maria would stand as a candidate for Antigua Labour Party in the St John's Rural East constituency. [18] She won the seat in the March 2018 election.

Carel	Robert Frank	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49646420	Getty Images  Robert Frank, one of the most influential photographers of the 20th Century, has died at the age of 94.  Frank, who was born in Switzerland but emigrated to the United States in 1947, was best known for his work The Americans - a book which chronicled his 10,000-mile journey across America at the height of the Cold War,  First published in France and then in the US. It was widely condemned by critics, as it depicted a country sharply at odds with the America portrayed by Hollywood and the ad men.  Earl A Powell III, art historian and museum director, said the work showed "a people plagued by racism, often ill-served by their politicians, intoxicated with the media and celebrities, and infatuated with speed, movement, and even the road itself".  Frank shot on a small 35mm camera without a motor, so unlike today where you'd find near identical frames sides by side, his contact sheets reveal how he has moved through the crowd, seizing moments of interest.  Ultimately, The Americans is a book that flows from front to back, a visual poem where sequencing was all important.  image copyrightRobert Frank courtesy Pace/MacGill  image copyrightRobert Frank courtesy Pace/MacGill  image copyrightRobert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill  image copyrightRobert Frank, courtesy Pace/MacGill  Frank's loose style broke the mould. He shot around 28,000 images that were edited down to 83 for a book that rewrote the rules of photo-journalism.  Beat poet Jack Kerouac wrote in the preface to the book's US edition, Frank "sucked a sad poem right out of America on to film."

Carel	John Lloyd	Individual	https://www.governmentnews.com.au/aps-diversity-stagnates-corruption-up-state-of-the-service/	Australian Public Service Commissioner John Lloyd is a glass half full kind of guy.  The Australian Public Service now has numerically fewer employees who are either indigenous or have a disability than a year ago – but the agency responsible for fostering and reporting on workplace diversity has still managed to extract a positive statistic to put the figures in a favourable light.  That’s the scenario that comes with the release of the annual State of the Service report this week, the Australian Public Service Commission’s annual update on the progress and challenges of the federal bureaucracy that this year heavily rationed the way it delivered and displays official information and statistics.  Like the public service, the annual report on it has been substantially shrunk and now weighs-in at slimline 63 pages from cover to cover with plenty of room for colourful big picture infographics favoured by consumer marketers over traditional tables of hard numbers.  It might be more user friendly as a top-line read, but don’t bother digging around for the details to stand-up up carefully crafted claims like the representation of Indigenous people in APS rising over the past year.  According to the State of the Service report “Indigenous people as a proportion of ongoing employees was 2.5 per cent in 2014, rising to 2.6 per cent in 2015.”  Although the 0.1 per cent increase just scrapes over the positivity line, the actual number of Indigenous employees actually fell by 55 people according to the more nerdy APS Statistical Bulletin that lists actual headcount numbers rather than just percentages.  According to the APS Statistical Bulletin there were 3607 Indigenous ongoing employees in 2014; that number that fell to 3552 in 2015.  The most likely reason for the technical percentage increase in workplace diversity is that the public service as a whole shed a total of 5526 employees in the 2014 – 2015 financial year according to the Statistical Bulletin.  Another way of looking the numbers is that proportionally fewer Indigenous public servants left their jobs than non-indigenous public servants, not exactly a feelgood statement.  According to the Statistical Bulletin’s tables, since total public service numbers peaked at 167,339 in 2012, the APS has cut a massive 14,909 jobs to arrive at the most recent number of 152,430 – a number last seen in 2007.  The Statistical Bulletin does firmly caution that its diversity data is supplied to agencies by individuals on a voluntary basis.  “As with any large voluntary data collection, APSED [Australian Public Service Employee Database] data tends to under-represent the number and proportion of Indigenous Australians, people with disability, and employees from a non-English speaking background (NESB) in the APS,” it says.  Even so, they are the same numbers from which the APSC extracts its percentages. To strictly compare apples with apples, the diversity data is based on ongoing APS employees.  For 2015, the total number of ongoing employees came in at 136, 498. That’s 8930 fewer than 2014 when it stood at 144,888.  There are also fewer people with a disability working in the public service. Yet the percentage movement on representation is also nominally positive . . . and eerily similar.  “Representation of people identifying with disability in the APS is at 3.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from 2014,” the State of the Service report says.  However with disability it does acknowledge the actual numbers have retreated and the reason why  “There has been a decline in the actual number of people with disability in the APS from 4,918 in 2014 to 4,778 in 2015. This is due to changes in the structure of the APS and the overall lower number of employees,” the State of the Service report says.  That’s a net loss 140 employees with a disability – but still a boost for representation.  Corruption overstated?  One reporting topic the APSC doesn’t appear too happy about is the thorny issue of corruption. That could be because as employee numbers are falling, corruption numbers appear to be rising.  Like productivity, the APSC seems to favour a tight conceptual definition of the term ‘corruption’ lest people become unduly alarmed over the full percentage point increase in “perceived corruption.”  “The definition of corruption, which was changed in this year’s employee census, may have contributed to the increase in perceived corruption ―from 2.6 per cent in 2013−14 to 3.6 per cent in 2014−15,” the State of the Service report helpfully explains.  “Similar to results from 2013−14, a large majority of employees witnessing corruption reported witnessing cronyism and nepotism.”  The APSC has also taken a curious swing at what warrants corrupt behaviour after agencies told it that 100 of the 557 finalised Code of Conduct investigations for 2014-15 “involved corrupt behaviour.” That’s a little under 20 per cent.  “The types of corrupt behaviour included inappropriate use of flex time; misuse of personal leave to undertake paid employment; conflict of interest on selection panels; theft; and misuse of duties to gain a personal benefit,” the State of the Service Report said.  “The relatively minor nature of many of these reported matters may be inconsistent with what is understood in the community by the term ‘corruption’. Nevertheless, misconduct of this kind still warrants appropriate attention and action.”  Appropriate is a relative term. Former NSW anti-corruption commissioner David Ipp has advocated for the creation of the equivalent of a Federal ICAC, an idea that seems to have mnore support outside Canberra than within it.  The APSC stresses that it’s working hard on integrity.  “The Commission is supporting the whole-of-government approach to integrity, including anti-corruption measures.

Carel	ICRC	Organization	https://www.icrc.org/en/document/terrorism-counter-terrorism-and-international-humanitarian-law	Statement of Christine Beerli, ICRC Vice-President at the 17th edition Bruges Colloquium , 20 -21 october 2016  Terrorism is a scourge to which the international community has been striving to respond for decades. The obvious challenges it poses are not only long-lasting, but also immediate. Wherever we turn these days, across the world, we are confronted with increased risks of terrorist acts. Terrorism is a global phenomenon sometimes closely link to armed conflict; and one which the international community is increasingly facing.  Terrorism negates the fundamental principles of humanity as well as the essential principles and objectives of international humanitarian law (IHL). In this regard, the ICRC condemns acts of terrorism, irrespective of their perpetrators, be they committed in or outside an armed conflict, and is deeply distressed by their devastating impact on communities and individuals.  Indeed, every day we see the dramatic consequences of the fight between States and non-State armed groups designated as terrorist, in particular in Africa and in the Levant. Irrespective of the claimed legitimacy of this fight or the causes espoused by or attributed to those involved therein, what we observe in the field is once again the civilian population bearing the brunt of armed violence. Cities are reduced to rubble, civilians are directly attacked, humanitarian and medical personnel, transports and infrastructures are targeted and prevented from fulfilling their functions, the civilian population is deprived of supplies essential for its survival through siege warfare, humanitarian access is denied and, resulting from all of this, hundreds of thousands of people are internally displaced or have fled their country, leaving a home, a job, a plot of land, or even close relatives behind. In the absence of a political solution, compliance with IHL and the fundamental values underpinning this body of law are required more than ever, from all sides, because prohibition of acts of terrorism and other violations of the law are not just binding on non-State armed groups.  The rise of non-state armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism is a growing concern domestically but also internationally. This situation has led States and international organizations to react by tightening existing counterterrorism measures and introducing new ones. Of course, the ICRC does not challenge the necessity of States to take legitimate measures to ensure their security. Nonetheless, while taking such measures to eliminate terrorism, the safeguards protecting human life and dignity must be upheld. In the ICRC's view, the international community must be clear and firm on the need for counterterrorism activities to be conducted in full respect of the protection afforded to all individuals by international law, in particular IHL and human rights law. Such respect is in the interest of the international community, as there is today growing recognition that violations of these bodies of international law may in turn exacerbate the very phenomenon that counterterrorism purports to fight.  Neither armed conflict nor terrorism are new forms of violence. Both have existed for a long time and have, for most part, been understood to be separate phenomena, as demonstrated by the different legal frameworks that regulate them. The perception that armed conflict and terrorism differ and that their respective legal rules are distinct has radically changed since September 2001 and the subsequent launching of the so-called "global war on terrorism". Recent years have again seen the rise of non-State armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism and the subsequent engagement of a coalition of States against them. This situation has put the relationship between IHL and the legal framework governing terrorism back into the spotlight and may have even created the perception that there may be a new "global war on terrorism" involving a group or groups of unbounded geographical reach.  The recent actions taken by States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist and the correlative counterterrorism discourse in both domestic and international fora have significantly contributed to a blurring of the lines between armed conflict and terrorism and their respective legal frameworks. This is further exacerbated by the fact that, often, counterterrorism instruments include situations of armed conflict in their scope of application. The resultant overlaps and contradictions between IHL and the legal instruments specifically designed to address terrorism is problematic. Counterterrorism norms may interfere with IHL's regulation of armed violence, notably by prohibiting conduct that is not unlawful under IHL, creating legal confusion and potentially adversely affecting some of the underlying principles of IHL. In this regard, one should carefully study the consequences of such interference and seek creative ways to ensure the integrity of IHL, thereby maintaining its rationale – which is needed more than ever in current armed conflicts.  The fight against terrorism may take various forms, including armed conflict. Determining when IHL applies to particular counterterrorism activities is not an easy enterprise. Not only because some States may tend to deny the applicability of IHL on the basis that non-State armed groups designated as terrorist organizations cannot be considered party to an armed conflict. How, when and where IHL applies to counterterrorism activities still raises important legal questions.  First of all, it is important to recall that any use of force against non-state armed groups designated as terrorist – or against members and affiliates thereof – is not necessarily synonymous with a situation of armed conflict governed by IHL. When armed force is used, only the facts on the ground are relevant for determining the legal classification of a situation of violence. Some situations may be classified as international armed conflicts, others as non-international armed conflicts, while various acts of violence may fall outside any armed conflict due to lack of requisite nexus. In the ICRC's view, this is also true for the fight against terrorism.  Another crucial question relating to IHL applicability is whether non-state armed groups designated as terrorist fulfil the organization criterion for classifying a situation as a non-international armed conflict. This is all the more difficult in view of the myriad of fluid, multiplying and fragmenting armed groups that frequently take part in the fighting. Often, their structure is difficult to understand. In some cases, some form of leadership structure emerges at some point, claiming to unite different armed groups, often based on pledges of allegiances. This raises the question of what link needs to exist between different armed groups in order to consider formerly distinct entities as one party to an armed conflict. The same question also emerges with regard to different groups that join forces transnationally, such as different armed groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group or to Al Qaida.  The spillover of conflicts into neighboring countries, their geographical expanse and their regionalization also appear to have become distinctive features of many contemporary armed conflicts involving non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. The transnational nature of such armed conflict involving a non-state armed group capable of operating in various countries – even non-contiguous ones – directly raises the question of IHL's territorial reach. This is still a much-debated area of the law – in particular when it comes to the applicability of IHL for military operations in the territory of non-belligerent States – that will certainly benefit from your insights.  IHL has been sometimes described – wrongly in the ICRC's view – as a set of rules which hinders the efforts of States to efficiently address their security concerns and fails to provide adequate tools to deal with non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. I am confident that we will be able to dispel some misconceptions in this regard and highlight the fact that, in situations of armed conflict, IHL should not be considered as an obstacle to the fight against terrorism. On the contrary, IHL can be a powerful tool at States' disposal while still providing important protections – complemented by human rights law – for those affected by the armed conflict between States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist. This added value of IHL is significant in the fields of the use of force and detention.  The phenomenon of the so-called "foreign fighters" – nationals of one country who travel abroad to fight alongside a non-State armed group in the territory of another State – has increased exponentially over the past few years. In order to quell the threats emanating from foreign fighters, States - in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council - have taken a variety of measures, including the use of force, detention (on terrorism charges, among others), and travel bans.  While most of the measures taken to prevent individuals from joining non-State armed groups or to mitigate the threat they may pose upon return are of a law enforcement nature, the applicability of IHL, where appropriate, should not be overlooked. However, so far, little attention has been paid to how IHL deals with the phenomenon of foreign fighters.  The concept of a "foreign fighter" is not a term of art in IHL. The general applicability of IHL to a situation of violence in which such fighters may be engaged does not depend on the nationality of those fighting. It depends only on the facts on the ground and on the fulfilment of certain legal conditions stemming from the relevant norms of IHL, in particular common Articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Conventions. In other words, in situations of armed conflict, IHL will govern the actions of foreign fighters, as well as any actions against them by parties to that conflict, when such actions have a nexus to the armed conflict concerned.  In this regard, it is important to underline that foreign fighters detained in relation to an armed conflict to which the detaining authorities are party must benefit from the protections afforded by the applicable IHL rules, irrespective of the domestic laws that also govern their detention. Unfortunately, States dealing with the phenomenon of foreign fighters tend to shy away from recognizing the applicability of IHL to their detention. Our discussions will certainly allow us to understand why this is so and to clear up the misapprehension that IHL would not allow States to prosecute foreign fighters – a misapprehension which, in the ICRC's views, has no legal basis under IHL.  For nearly a decade the idea that the risk of radicalization potentially leading to violent actions should be addressed though social prevention programs has significantly progressed. Many States are developing and implementing various domestic plans to address the root causes of this phenomenon. These programs are now usually referred as preventing or countering violent extremism (P/CVE). States' understanding that "terrorism" must be fought through more than simply military or hard security means is in fact not a new avenue. It is mimicking years of counter-insurgency strategies and stabilization concepts implemented in conflict affected countries. Yet such P/CVE model has gained considerable ground amongst countries confronted to so-called home grown terrorism and the re-occurrence of violent actions against their respective population. In this political context, international organizations, the RC/RC Movement and various civil society actors are being asked to partner with states and support this movement through their existing or specially design programs.  The ICRC does not question the merit of these initiatives which may ultimately contribute to limit the risks of violations and abuses. However, while recognizing the general purpose of P/CVE concept as expressed in the recent UN plan of action that is to address the root cause of extreme violence, one should not underestimate its potential adverse effects on the existing legal protection frameworks. There may be also a risk that humanitarian organizations associated with CVE/PVE programs be seen by some States and non-State actors as politically motivated and therefore incapable to carry out a neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action.  Within the framework of counterterrorism measures, efforts to curb and criminalize all possible direct and indirect support to so-called terrorist organizations have led to increased control and restraint on all activities, including humanitarian activities, that could in any way be seen as providing support to non-State armed groups or individuals designated as terrorists. Consequently, there is a significant risk that such measures, in particular criminal legislation, may further reduce the humanitarian space which the ICRC and other impartial humanitarian organizations need in order to carry out their neutral, independent and impartial activities.  Since 2011, the ICRC has on various occasions shared its concerns that such counter-terrorism measures have the potential to criminalize a range of humanitarian actors and their personnel, and may create obstacles to the funding of humanitarian activities. The unqualified prohibition of acts of "material support," "services" and "assistance to" or "association with" terrorist organizations found in certain criminal laws could, in practice, result in the criminalization of the core activities of impartial humanitarian organizations, and their personnel, that are endeavoring to meet the needs of victims of armed conflicts or situations of violence below the threshold of armed conflict.  In addition, the potential criminalization of humanitarian engagement with non-State armed groups designated as "terrorist organizations" and of humanitarian activities carried out in areas controlled by these groups may be said to reflect a non-acceptance of the notion of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action – a notion which the ICRC strives to promote in its operational work in the field.  The ICRC has deployed significant efforts to persuade States to stop legislating against principles they have supported and endorsed through IHL treaties, as well as to ensure that the new legal frameworks being developed as part of counterterrorism strategies do not challenge principled humanitarian action. So far, our work on this crucial issue was not as successful as we had expected, but the ICRC is convinced that stakeholders will understand the necessity to harmonize their policies and legal obligations across the humanitarian and counterterrorism realms.

The obvious challenges it poses are not only long-lasting, but also immediate. Wherever we turn these days, across the world, we are confronted with increased risks of terrorist acts. Terrorism is a global phenomenon sometimes closely link to armed conflict; and one which the international community is increasingly facing.\n\nTerrorism negates the fundamental principles of humanity as well as the essential principles and objectives of international humanitarian law (IHL). In this regard, the ICRC condemns acts of terrorism, irrespective of their perpetrators, be they committed in or outside an armed conflict, and is deeply distressed by their devastating impact on communities and individuals.\n\nIndeed, every day we see the dramatic consequences of the fight between States and non-State armed groups designated as terrorist, in particular in Africa and in the Levant. Irrespective of the claimed legitimacy of this fight or the causes espoused by or attributed to those involved therein, what we observe in the field is once again the civilian population bearing the brunt of armed violence. Cities are reduced to rubble, civilians are directly attacked, humanitarian and medical personnel, transports and infrastructures are targeted and prevented from fulfilling their functions, the civilian population is deprived of supplies essential for its survival through siege warfare, humanitarian access is denied and, resulting from all of this, hundreds of thousands of people are internally displaced or have fled their country, leaving a home, a job, a plot of land, or even close relatives behind. In the absence of a political solution, compliance with IHL and the fundamental values underpinning this body of law are required more than ever, from all sides, because prohibition of acts of terrorism and other violations of the law are not just binding on non-State armed groups.\n\nThe rise of non-state armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism is a growing concern domestically but also internationally. This situation has led States and international organizations to react by tightening existing counterterrorism measures and introducing new ones. Of course, the ICRC does not challenge the necessity of States to take legitimate measures to ensure their security. Nonetheless, while taking such measures to eliminate terrorism, the safeguards protecting human life and dignity must be upheld. In the ICRC\'s view, the international community must be clear and firm on the need for counterterrorism activities to be conducted in full respect of the protection afforded to all individuals by international law, in particular IHL and human rights law. Such respect is in the interest of the international community, as there is today growing recognition that violations of these bodies of international law may in turn exacerbate the very phenomenon that counterterrorism purports to fight.\n\nNeither armed conflict nor terrorism are new forms of violence. Both have existed for a long time and have, for most part, been understood to be separate phenomena, as demonstrated by the different legal frameworks that regulate them. The perception that armed conflict and terrorism differ and that their respective legal rules are distinct has radically changed since September 2001 and the subsequent launching of the so-called "global war on terrorism". Recent years have again seen the rise of non-State armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism and the subsequent engagement of a coalition of States against them. This situation has put the relationship between IHL and the legal framework governing terrorism back into the spotlight and may have even created the perception that there may be a new "global war on terrorism" involving a group or groups of unbounded geographical reach.\n\nThe recent actions taken by States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist and the correlative counterterrorism discourse in both domestic and international fora have significantly contributed to a blurring of the lines between armed conflict and terrorism and their respective legal frameworks. This is further exacerbated by the fact that, often, counterterrorism instruments include situations of armed conflict in their scope of application. The resultant overlaps and contradictions between IHL and the legal instruments specifically designed to address terrorism is problematic. Counterterrorism norms may interfere with IHL\'s regulation of armed violence, notably by prohibiting conduct that is not unlawful under IHL, creating legal confusion and potentially adversely affecting some of the underlying principles of IHL. In this regard, one should carefully study the consequences of such interference and seek creative ways to ensure the integrity of IHL, thereby maintaining its rationale – which is needed more than ever in current armed conflicts.\n\nThe fight against terrorism may take various forms, including armed conflict. Determining when IHL applies to particular counterterrorism activities is not an easy enterprise. Not only because some States may tend to deny the applicability of IHL on the basis that non-State armed groups designated as terrorist organizations cannot be considered party to an armed conflict. How, when and where IHL applies to counterterrorism activities still raises important legal questions.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to recall that any use of force against non-state armed groups designated as terrorist – or against members and affiliates thereof – is not necessarily synonymous with a situation of armed conflict governed by IHL.

This raises the question of what link needs to exist between different armed groups in order to consider formerly distinct entities as one party to an armed conflict.

The unqualified prohibition of acts of "material support," "services" and "assistance to" or "association with" terrorist organizations found in certain criminal laws could, in practice, result in the criminalization of the core activities of impartial humanitarian organizations, and their personnel, that are endeavoring to meet the needs of victims of armed conflicts or situations of violence below the threshold of armed conflict.</p><p>In addition, the potential criminalization of humanitarian engagement with non-State armed groups designated as "terrorist organizations" and of humanitarian activities carried out in areas controlled by these groups may be said to reflect a non-acceptance of the notion of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action – a notion which the ICRC strives to promote in its operational work in the field.</p><p>The ICRC has deployed significant efforts to persuade States to stop legislating against principles they have supported and endorsed through IHL treaties, as well as to ensure that the new legal frameworks being developed as part of counterterrorism strategies do not challenge principled humanitarian action. So far, our work on this crucial issue was not as successful as we had expected, but the ICRC is convinced that stakeholders will understand the necessity to harmonize their policies and legal obligations across the humanitarian and counterterrorism realms.</p><p>For more information on the Bruges colloquium, please consult the following website of the College of Europe : <a title="Bruges Colloquium " href="http://www.coe-icrc.eu/en" target="_blank">http://www.coe-icrc.eu/en</a></p></div>', 'articleBodyHtml': '<article>\n\n<figure><img src="https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/styles/document_main/public/document/image/v-p-sy-e-00607_1920.jpg?itok=9b_y8LBO" alt="Terrorism, counter-terrorism and international humanitarian law"><figcaption>Homs, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Statement of Christine Beerli, ICRC Vice-President at the 17th edition Bruges Colloquium , </strong>20 -21 october 2016</p>\n\n<p>Terrorism is a scourge to which the international community has been striving to respond for decades. The obvious challenges it poses are not only long-lasting, but also immediate. Wherever we turn these days, across the world, we are confronted with increased risks of terrorist acts. Terrorism is a global phenomenon sometimes closely link to armed conflict; and one which the international community is increasingly facing.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorism negates the fundamental principles of humanity as well as the essential principles and objectives of international humanitarian law (IHL). In this regard, the ICRC condemns acts of terrorism, irrespective of their perpetrators, be they committed in or outside an armed conflict, and is deeply distressed by their devastating impact on communities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, every day we see the dramatic consequences of the fight between States and non-State armed groups designated as terrorist, in particular in Africa and in the Levant. Irrespective of the claimed legitimacy of this fight or the causes espoused by or attributed to those involved therein, what we observe in the field is once again the civilian population bearing the brunt of armed violence. Cities are reduced to rubble, civilians are directly attacked, humanitarian and medical personnel, transports and infrastructures are targeted and prevented from fulfilling their functions, the civilian population is deprived of supplies essential for its survival through siege warfare, humanitarian access is denied and, resulting from all of this, hundreds of thousands of people are internally displaced or have fled their country, leaving a home, a job, a plot of land, or even close relatives behind. In the absence of a political solution, compliance with IHL and the fundamental values underpinning this body of law are required more than ever, from all sides, because prohibition of acts of terrorism and other violations of the law are not just binding on non-State armed groups.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src="https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/Worldwide/Western-and-Central-Europe-and-the-Balkans/Belgium/dsc_0329.jpg" alt="Colloque de Bruges 2016"></p><figcaption><p><a title="BRUGES 2016 PHOTO GALLERY" href="http://www.coe-icrc.eu/en/gallery/bruges-colloquium-17th-edition-2016%20">BRUGES 2016 PHOTO GALLERY</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The rise of non-state armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism is a growing concern domestically but also internationally. This situation has led States and international organizations to react by tightening existing counterterrorism measures and introducing new ones. Of course, the ICRC does not challenge the necessity of States to take legitimate measures to ensure their security. Nonetheless, while taking such measures to eliminate terrorism, the safeguards protecting human life and dignity must be upheld. In the ICRC\'s view, the international community must be clear and firm on the need for counterterrorism activities to be conducted in full respect of the protection afforded to all individuals by international law, in particular IHL and human rights law. Such respect is in the interest of the international community, as there is today growing recognition that violations of these bodies of international law may in turn exacerbate the very phenomenon that counterterrorism purports to fight.</p>\n\n<p>Neither armed conflict nor terrorism are new forms of violence. Both have existed for a long time and have, for most part, been understood to be separate phenomena, as demonstrated by the different legal frameworks that regulate them. The perception that armed conflict and terrorism differ and that their respective legal rules are distinct has radically changed since September 2001 and the subsequent launching of the so-called "global war on terrorism". Recent years have again seen the rise of non-State armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism and the subsequent engagement of a coalition of States against them. This situation has put the relationship between IHL and the legal framework governing terrorism back into the spotlight and may have even created the perception that there may be a new "global war on terrorism" involving a group or groups of unbounded geographical reach.</p>\n\n<p>The recent actions taken by States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist and the correlative counterterrorism discourse in both domestic and international fora have significantly contributed to a blurring of the lines between armed conflict and terrorism and their respective legal frameworks. This is further exacerbated by the fact that, often, counterterrorism instruments include situations of armed conflict in their scope of application. The resultant overlaps and contradictions between IHL and the legal instruments specifically designed to address terrorism is problematic. Counterterrorism norms may interfere with IHL\'s regulation of armed violence, notably by prohibiting conduct that is not unlawful under IHL, creating legal confusion and potentially adversely affecting some of the underlying principles of IHL. In this regard, one should carefully study the consequences of such interference and seek creative ways to ensure the integrity of IHL, thereby maintaining its rationale – which is needed more than ever in current armed conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>The fight against terrorism may take various forms, including armed conflict. Determining when IHL applies to particular counterterrorism activities is not an easy enterprise. Not only because some States may tend to deny the applicability of IHL on the basis that non-State armed groups designated as terrorist organizations cannot be considered party to an armed conflict. How, when and where IHL applies to counterterrorism activities still raises important legal questions.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it is important to recall that any use of force against non-state armed groups designated as terrorist – or against members and affiliates thereof – is not necessarily synonymous with a situation of armed conflict governed by IHL. When armed force is used, only the facts on the ground are relevant for determining the legal classification of a situation of violence. Some situations may be classified as international armed conflicts, others as non-international armed conflicts, while various acts of violence may fall outside any armed conflict due to lack of requisite nexus. In the ICRC\'s view, this is also true for the fight against terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>Another crucial question relating to IHL applicability is whether non-state armed groups designated as terrorist fulfil the organization criterion for classifying a situation as a non-international armed conflict. This is all the more difficult in view of the myriad of fluid, multiplying and fragmenting armed groups that frequently take part in the fighting. Often, their structure is difficult to understand. In some cases, some form of leadership structure emerges at some point, claiming to unite different armed groups, often based on pledges of allegiances. This raises the question of what link needs to exist between different armed groups in order to consider formerly distinct entities as one party to an armed conflict. The same question also emerges with regard to different groups that join forces transnationally, such as different armed groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group or to Al Qaida.</p>\n\n<p>The spillover of conflicts into neighboring countries, their geographical expanse and their regionalization also appear to have become distinctive features of many contemporary armed conflicts involving non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. The transnational nature of such armed conflict involving a non-state armed group capable of operating in various countries – even non-contiguous ones – directly raises the question of IHL\'s territorial reach. This is still a much-debated area of the law – in particular when it comes to the applicability of IHL for military operations in the territory of non-belligerent States – that will certainly benefit from your insights.</p>\n\n<p>IHL has been sometimes described – wrongly in the ICRC\'s view – as a set of rules which hinders the efforts of States to efficiently address their security concerns and fails to provide adequate tools to deal with non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. I am confident that we will be able to dispel some misconceptions in this regard and highlight the fact that, in situations of armed conflict, IHL should not be considered as an obstacle to the fight against terrorism. On the contrary, IHL can be a powerful tool at States\' disposal while still providing important protections – complemented by human rights law – for those affected by the armed conflict between States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist. This added value of IHL is significant in the fields of the use of force and detention.</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon of the so-called "foreign fighters" – nationals of one country who travel abroad to fight alongside a non-State armed group in the territory of another State – has increased exponentially over the past few years. In order to quell the threats emanating from foreign fighters, States - in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council - have taken a variety of measures, including the use of force, detention (on terrorism charges, among others), and travel bans.</p>\n\n<p>While most of the measures taken to prevent individuals from joining non-State armed groups or to mitigate the threat they may pose upon return are of a law enforcement nature, the applicability of IHL, where appropriate, should not be overlooked. However, so far, little attention has been paid to how IHL deals with the phenomenon of foreign fighters.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of a "foreign fighter" is not a term of art in IHL. The general applicability of IHL to a situation of violence in which such fighters may be engaged does not depend on the nationality of those fighting. It depends only on the facts on the ground and on the fulfilment of certain legal conditions stemming from the relevant norms of IHL, in particular common Articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Conventions. In other words, in situations of armed conflict, IHL will govern the actions of foreign fighters, as well as any actions against them by parties to that conflict, when such actions have a nexus to the armed conflict concerned.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard, it is important to underline that foreign fighters detained in relation to an armed conflict to which the detaining authorities are party must benefit from the protections afforded by the applicable IHL rules, irrespective of the domestic laws that also govern their detention. Unfortunately, States dealing with the phenomenon of foreign fighters tend to shy away from recognizing the applicability of IHL to their detention. Our discussions will certainly allow us to understand why this is so and to clear up the misapprehension that IHL would not allow States to prosecute foreign fighters – a misapprehension which, in the ICRC\'s views, has no legal basis under IHL.</p>\n\n<p>For nearly a decade the idea that the risk of radicalization potentially leading to violent actions should be addressed though social prevention programs has significantly progressed. Many States are developing and implementing various domestic plans to address the root causes of this phenomenon. These programs are now usually referred as preventing or countering violent extremism (P/CVE). States\' understanding that "terrorism" must be fought through more than simply military or hard security means is in fact not a new avenue. It is mimicking years of counter-insurgency strategies and stabilization concepts implemented in conflict affected countries. Yet such P/CVE model has gained considerable ground amongst countries confronted to so-called home grown terrorism and the re-occurrence of violent actions against their respective population. In this political context, international organizations, the RC/RC Movement and various civil society actors are being asked to partner with states and support this movement through their existing or specially design programs.</p>\n\n<p>The ICRC does not question the merit of these initiatives which may ultimately contribute to limit the risks of violations and abuses. However, while recognizing the general purpose of P/CVE concept as expressed in the recent UN plan of action that is to address the root cause of extreme violence, one should not underestimate its potential adverse effects on the existing legal protection frameworks. There may be also a risk that humanitarian organizations associated with CVE/PVE programs be seen by some States and non-State actors as politically motivated and therefore incapable to carry out a neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action.</p>\n\n<p>Within the framework of counterterrorism measures, efforts to curb and criminalize all possible direct and indirect support to so-called terrorist organizations have led to increased control and restraint on all activities, including humanitarian activities, that could in any way be seen as providing support to non-State armed groups or individuals designated as terrorists. Consequently, there is a significant risk that such measures, in particular criminal legislation, may further reduce the humanitarian space which the ICRC and other impartial humanitarian organizations need in order to carry out their neutral, independent and impartial activities.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2011, the ICRC has on various occasions shared its concerns that such counter-terrorism measures have the potential to criminalize a range of humanitarian actors and their personnel, and may create obstacles to the funding of humanitarian activities. The unqualified prohibition of acts of "material support," "services" and "assistance to" or "association with" terrorist organizations found in certain criminal laws could, in practice, result in the criminalization of the core activities of impartial humanitarian organizations, and their personnel, that are endeavoring to meet the needs of victims of armed conflicts or situations of violence below the threshold of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the potential criminalization of humanitarian engagement with non-State armed groups designated as "terrorist organizations" and of humanitarian activities carried out in areas controlled by these groups may be said to reflect a non-acceptance of the notion of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action – a notion which the ICRC strives to promote in its operational work in the field.</p>\n\n<p>The ICRC has deployed significant efforts to persuade States to stop legislating against principles they have supported and endorsed through IHL treaties, as well as to ensure that the new legal frameworks being developed as part of counterterrorism strategies do not challenge principled humanitarian action.

Carel	Christine Lagarde	Individual	https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/06/21/sp062217-working-together-to-fight-money-laundering-terrorist-financing	Ladies and Gentlemen—good morning.  Dear President Vega-Serrano, thank you for your kind invitation and all of you for your warm welcome.  It is wonderful to be in Valencia—a city that combines ancient roots with modern architecture, 21 st -century commerce, and some of the world’s best food. This is a community that values innovation and creativity.  I can see that Valencian spirit of innovation here in this room today. Both FATF and the IMF are forward-thinking organizations designed to help our members address some of the most pressing global issues of our time.  We both are deeply committed to supporting countries in building defenses against money laundering and the financing of terrorism through the AML/CFT standards. We both know that these global challenges cannot be resolved by countries working alone.  I am therefore very proud of the close relationship that the IMF and FATF have forged over nearly two decades. This partnership is more important than ever.  There is no doubt that money laundering and terrorist financing can threaten a country’s economic stability, which is why the IMF has become increasingly active in supporting and promoting the AML/CFT efforts of our member countries, based on the FATF standard.  What started as a small endeavor some 20 years ago has become part of our core work—from analysis and policy advice, to assessing the health and integrity of financial sectors, to providing financial assistance when needed, to helping countries build institutions and increase operational effectiveness.  Together we have come a long way, and together we can build on the progress made so far. Let me highlight three priorities:  Fighting corruption and tax evasion; Combating the financing of terrorism; and Maintaining correspondent banking relationships.  1. Fighting corruption and tax evasion  First, we need to intensify our fight against corruption and tax evasion. We will soon release new analysis that shows how systemic corruption can seriously undermine a country’s ability to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.  Large-scale tax evasion is a key factor, because it typically means lower government revenue, higher public debt, and less investment in health, education, and other public services. It means higher economic inequality because the most vulnerable are most affected by a sharp drop in social spending. That, in turn, can trigger popular discontent and economic instability.  The good news is that we can use the AML/CFT framework to help break this vicious economic cycle.  A good example is Greece, where the strengthening of the AML framework facilitated the seizure of hundreds of millions of euros in proceeds from tax crimes.  We helped the central bank strengthen its financial sector supervision, which led to a sharp increase in reporting to the financial intelligence unit. That unit itself froze more than €200 million in assets between 2012 and 2014. The financial intelligence unit also referred more than 400 cases to the prosecutor’s office and more than 2,500 cases to the tax authorities.  Another area where the FATF standard is immensely helpful is in promoting transparency. The Panama Papers, for example, were a stark reminder of the need to do more in this area—something that you had already long recognized.  2. Combating the financing of terrorism.  Another policy priority is to combat the financing of terrorism. As terrorism is becoming more pervasive in our societies, it is our collective responsibility to choke off the financial flows—both large and small—that enable terrorists to inflict unspeakable suffering on individuals, families, and communities.  Over the past 16 years, we have been involved in this joint effort through our technical assistance and capacity building work.  In 2014, for example, we called on Sudan to strengthen its CFT framework—and we have since worked with the government there to develop targeted financial sanctions that are consistent with the FATF standard. We are working on a practical guidance for all our members on how to implement such sanctions, which should be available by 2019.  Combating the financing of terrorism increasingly requires harnessing the power of financial technology, or fintech.  Of course, fintech is a double-edged sword. It can be used to promote and fund terrorism, including through the anonymity of virtual currencies. But it can also be a powerful tool to strengthen our defenses against the financing of terrorism.  We can use fintech to identify terrorist financial flows, including in the case of very small transactions. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence tools can help identify patterns of activity that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.  Fintech can also help protect financial systems against cyber-terrorism. A good example is the “distributed ledger” technology that underpins virtual currencies and other applications. This technology is less vulnerable to a single point of failure and could prove resilient to cyberattacks because the ledger—or record of transactions—exists in multiple copies.  I would like to commend President Vega-Serrano—and the FATF more generally—for addressing both the opportunities and the new issues raised by technology, including through your recent roundtables with the private sector.  It is important that regulatory frameworks remain adequate to the task. We have also just published a paper that provides a framework for assessing the impact of technological innovation within the financial sector. [1]  3. Maintaining correspondent banking relationships  The third and final policy priority is to support countries that are at risk of losing vital banking services that keep them connected to the global financial system.  These correspondent banking relationships are especially important for small countries with small financial systems—in Africa, the Caribbean, in Central Asia, and in the Pacific, to name a few. Recent surveys in our member countries underline the high degree of concern about the situation in these economies. [2]  To be clear, this issue has many dimensions, involving regulators, the financial industry, and the affected countries themselves.  The good news is that FATF has been working hard to ensure that the application of a robust AML/CFT framework does not lead to an indiscriminate withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships. I commend your decision to clarify the regulatory expectations under the FATF standard, including the customer due diligence requirements.  Greater regulatory certainty means that global banks are more likely to maintain their correspondent banking business. This, in turn, will help support economic and financial stability in the affected countries.  But the threat to growth and jobs means that more needs to be done by everybody. [3]  One of our contributions has been to bring together local banks, global banks, and other key stakeholders to discuss possible solutions.  For instance, a recent workshop in the Caribbean focused on improving the capacity of small banks to manage risks with the help of regional development banks, and how to enhance communication between the local and correspondent banks.  We will also continue to help our smaller member countries build capacity. For example, we have been working with Costa Rica, Peru, and Uruguay to create national AML/CFT strategies. And we recently helped Ukraine, Mongolia and Qatar strengthen the governance and capacity of their financial intelligence units.  Altogether, we have provided technical assistance on AML/CFT to 120 countries. And I am proud that our assistance was instrumental for countries such as Myanmar, Nepal, and Sudan to exit FATF monitoring and reconnect to the global financial system.  Conclusion  Let me conclude by saying that I would like us to continue our close cooperation—building on the progress made so far, for example, on the standard and assessment methodology.  As you know, we are very supportive of the risk-based approach—and the emphasis on effectiveness—under the revised FATF standard. We look forward to the targeted follow-up assessments that will focus on countries’ main risks.  As a final thought, Winston Churchill often encouraged his staff to “ level with events ”—by which he meant that they should tell the unvarnished truth—no sugar-coating of the facts.  Corruption, tax evasion, the financing of terrorism, and financial exclusion: these are big challenges for our member countries today—and they need to be addressed head-on.  By standing together as one, and by “leveling with events”, we will have the opportunity to promote financial integrity and inclusive growth for the benefit of all.  Thank you.

This is a community that values innovation and\ncreativity.\n</p>\n<p>\nI can see that Valencian spirit of innovation here in this room today. Both\nFATF and the IMF are forward-thinking organizations designed to help our\nmembers address some of the most pressing global issues of our time.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe both are deeply committed to supporting countries in building defenses\nagainst <strong>money laundering </strong>and the<strong> financing of terrorism</strong> through the    <strong>AML/CFT</strong> standards. We both know that these global\nchallenges cannot be resolved by countries working alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am therefore very proud of the close relationship that the IMF and FATF\nhave forged over nearly two decades. This partnership is more important\nthan ever.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is no doubt that money laundering and terrorist financing can\nthreaten a country’s economic stability, which is why the IMF has become\nincreasingly active in supporting and promoting the AML/CFT efforts of our\nmember countries, based on the FATF standard.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat started as a small endeavor some 20 years ago has become part of our\ncore work—from analysis and policy advice, to assessing the health and\nintegrity of financial sectors, to providing financial assistance when\nneeded, to helping countries build institutions and increase operational\neffectiveness.\n</p>\n<p>\nTogether we have come a long way, and together we can build on the progress\nmade so far. Let me highlight three priorities:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    Fighting corruption and tax evasion;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    Combating the financing of terrorism; and\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    Maintaining correspondent banking relationships.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>1. Fighting corruption and tax evasion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, we need to intensify our fight against corruption and tax evasion.\nWe will soon release new analysis that shows how systemic corruption can\nseriously undermine a country’s ability to deliver sustainable and\ninclusive growth.<strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Large-scale tax evasion</strong>\nis a key factor, because it typically means lower government revenue,\nhigher public debt, and less investment in health, education, and other\npublic services. It means higher economic inequality because the most\nvulnerable are most affected by a sharp drop in social spending. That, in\nturn, can trigger popular discontent and economic instability.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe good news is that we can use the AML/CFT framework to help break this\nvicious economic cycle.\n</p>\n<p>\nA good example is Greece, where the strengthening of the AML framework\nfacilitated the seizure of hundreds of millions of euros in proceeds from\ntax crimes.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe helped the central bank strengthen its financial sector supervision,\nwhich led to a sharp increase in reporting to the financial intelligence\nunit. That unit itself froze more than €200 million in assets between 2012\nand 2014. The financial intelligence unit also referred more than 400 cases\nto the prosecutor’s office and more than 2,500 cases to the tax\nauthorities.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother area where the FATF standard is immensely helpful is in promoting\ntransparency. The Panama Papers, for example, were a stark reminder of the\nneed to do more in this area—something that you had already long\nrecognized.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2. Combating the financing of terrorism.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother policy priority is to    <strong>combat the financing of terrorism</strong>. As terrorism is\nbecoming more pervasive in our societies, it is our collective\nresponsibility to choke off the financial flows—both large and small—that\nenable terrorists to inflict unspeakable suffering on individuals,\nfamilies, and communities.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver the past 16 years, we have been involved in this joint effort through\nour technical assistance and capacity building work.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2014, for example, we called on Sudan to strengthen its CFT\nframework—and we have since worked with the government there to develop\ntargeted financial sanctions that are consistent with the FATF standard. We\nare working on a practical guidance for all our members on how to implement\nsuch sanctions, which should be available by 2019.\n</p>\n<p>\nCombating the financing of terrorism increasingly requires harnessing the\npower of financial technology, or <strong>fintech</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nOf course, fintech is a double-edged sword. It can be used to promote and\nfund terrorism, including through the anonymity of virtual currencies. But\nit can also be a powerful tool to <em>strengthen</em> our defenses against\nthe financing of terrorism.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe can use fintech to <em>identify</em> terrorist financial flows,\nincluding in the case of very small transactions. Machine learning and\nother artificial intelligence tools can help identify patterns of activity\nthat would otherwise be very difficult to detect.\n</p>\n<p>\nFintech can also help <em>protect </em>financial systems against\ncyber-terrorism.<em> </em>A good example is the “distributed ledger”\ntechnology that underpins virtual currencies and other applications. This\ntechnology is less vulnerable to a single point of failure and could prove\nresilient to cyberattacks because the ledger—or record of\ntransactions—exists in multiple copies.\n</p>\n<p>\nI would like to commend President Vega-Serrano—and the FATF more\ngenerally—for addressing both the opportunities and the new issues raised\nby technology, including through your recent roundtables with the private\nsector.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is important that regulatory frameworks remain adequate to the task. We\nhave also just published a paper that provides a framework for assessing\nthe impact of technological innovation within the financial sector.\n<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Maintaining correspondent banking relationships</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe third and final policy priority is to support countries that are at\nrisk of losing vital banking services that keep them connected to the\nglobal financial system.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese <strong>correspondent banking relationships</strong> are especially\nimportant for small countries with small financial systems—in Africa, the\nCaribbean, in Central Asia, and in the Pacific, to name a few. Recent\nsurveys in our member countries underline the high degree of concern about\nthe situation in these economies.\n<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nTo be clear, this issue has many dimensions, involving regulators, the\nfinancial industry, and the affected countries themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe good news is that FATF has been working hard to ensure that the\napplication of a robust AML/CFT framework does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> lead to an\nindiscriminate withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships. I commend\nyour decision to clarify the regulatory expectations under the FATF\nstandard, including the customer due diligence requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\nGreater regulatory certainty means that global banks are more likely to\nmaintain their correspondent banking business. This, in turn, will help\nsupport economic and financial stability in the affected countries.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the threat to growth and jobs means that more needs to be done by\neverybody.\n<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of our contributions has been to bring together local banks, global\nbanks, and other key stakeholders to discuss possible solutions.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor instance, a recent workshop in the Caribbean focused on improving the\ncapacity of small banks to manage risks with the help of regional\ndevelopment banks, and how to enhance communication between the local and\ncorrespondent banks.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will also continue to help our smaller member countries build capacity.\nFor example, we have been working with Costa Rica, Peru, and Uruguay to\ncreate national AML/CFT strategies. And we recently helped Ukraine,\nMongolia and Qatar strengthen the governance and capacity of their\nfinancial intelligence units.\n</p>\n<p>\nAltogether, we have provided technical assistance on AML/CFT to    <strong>120 countries</strong>.

Carel	United Nations	Organization	https://www.biznews.com/leadership/2016/09/13/south-africas-shock-crime-statistics-more-worrying-than-corruption-expert-analysis	South Africans have been baying for blood as evidence mounts that the country’s political leaders have been feathering their nests through a range of approaches – from state capture to corruption. Yet, equally appalling is the government’s poor record at tackling the country’s crime rate. South Africans are so innured to murder, rape, robbery and other acts of extreme violence, it seems, that some see it as a positive sign that the murder rate in Cape Town has dropped from 63 out of every 100 000 Capetonians to 62 out of every 100 000. That decline, however, is miniscule, and to focus on that – and other similar trends – in the national crime figures released by police is to ignore an astonishing state of affairs: innocent citizens are being killed and maimed at a rate that makes the country look like a war zone. The reasons for the high crime rate are complex and include legacy apartheid issues. But in reality the ANC government has failed to put a concerted effort into radically overhauling the system so that justice is seen to be done – swiftly. The Oscar Pistorius trial reminded the world that beyond those postcard-perfect pictures of Table Mountain, safari parks and pristine seascapes, South Africa has a vicious underbelly – and for that there must be a price to pay in terms of keeping a lid on the tourism industry. For citizens, however, who live their daily lives literally dodging bullets and losing friends and family to crimes that go unpunished, the price must increasingly be a political one. The crime rate has surely played into the sharp fall-off in support for the ANC in the country’s metropolitan areas where survival cannot be possible without defences ranging from burglar bars to guns and other weapons.- Jackie Cameron  By Anine Kriegler  South Africa struggles with very high levels of crime and violence. Take the crime statistic on murder rates. The country ranks in the top 10 worst countries that report crime statistics according to the most recent data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  Crime rate comparisons between countries are fraught with challenges and should be understood as broad indications rather than accurate quantitative relationships. Nevertheless, South Africa by any measure has a serious crime problem.  What insights can be gleaned from the latest annual crime statistics released by South Africa’s police?  What the numbers say  To draw meaningful conclusions about longer term trends it is necessary to use rates per 100,000 people in the population. For the last few years South Africa’s police force has opted to publicise only the raw figures for the number of crimes recorded. This doesn’t account for population growth over time, or differences in population sizes between regions or towns.  The latest numbers had this to reveal about the five key crime types that are particularly worth watching.  Murder rate: this has risen nationally for the fourth year in a row, from 33 per 100,000 in 2014/2015 to 34 per 100,000 last year.  More concerning than the overall high number of murders, which is by no means a new development, is the fact that its rate of increase has accelerated. Whereas the rise from 2013/2014 to 2014/2015 was by 2.6%, the rise from 2014/2015 to 2015/2016 was by 3.1%. This suggests that the recent increase in fatal violence is not slowing and that South Africa may be in for several more years of increase. The country urgently needs to work out why these increases are happening.  Murder rate in Cape Town: after five bad years, this may finally have turned the corner. Cape Town’s murder rate declined from 63 per 100,000 last year to 62 this year. This is a positive sign, but there is clearly a lot more work to be done. It is still at almost twice the national rate and among the highest in the world.  Aggravated robbery trends: The national rates of residential and non- residential robbery showed no decline although the rate at which they increased was smaller than it had been in years. Following the major increases between 2005/2006 and 2008/2009, it seems that relative stability in these crimes may have been reached. Turning them to a decline looks increasingly possible. The police should take heart.  Burglary: Recorded rates of burglary have continued their long and fairly steady decline and are now about a third lower than they were 15 years ago. This should be a comfort given how much this crime contributes to public fear. It does, however, appear that people may have become less inclined to report this crime to the police. The upcoming Victims of Crime Survey should be watched closely to see if this trend continues and to what extent it may be contributing to recorded rates of decline.  Drug-related crime and illegal possession of firearms: There has been a decrease in the recorded rates of drug-related crime for the first time in more than 20 years.  This could be the police’s new back to basics plan in action. Acting head of police Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane has championed a renewed focus on policing fundamentals and areas of under-performance.

Yet, equally appalling is the government’s poor record at tackling the country’s crime rate. South Africans are so innured to murder, rape, robbery and other acts of extreme violence, it seems, that some see it as a positive sign that the murder rate in Cape Town has dropped from 63 out of every 100 000 Capetonians to 62 out of every 100 000. That decline, however, is miniscule, and to focus on that – and other similar trends – in the national crime figures released by police is to ignore an astonishing state of affairs: innocent citizens are being killed and maimed at a rate that makes the country look like a war zone. The reasons for the high crime rate are complex and include legacy apartheid issues. But in reality the ANC government has failed to put a concerted effort into radically overhauling the system so that justice is seen to be done – swiftly. The Oscar Pistorius trial reminded the world that beyond those postcard-perfect pictures of Table Mountain, safari parks and pristine seascapes, South Africa has a vicious underbelly – and for that there must be a price to pay in terms of keeping a lid on the tourism industry. For citizens, however, who live their daily lives literally dodging bullets and losing friends and family to crimes that go unpunished, the price must increasingly be a political one. The crime rate has surely played into the sharp fall-off in support for the ANC in the country’s metropolitan areas where survival cannot be possible without defences ranging from burglar bars to guns and other weapons.- Jackie Cameron\n\nBy Anine Kriegler\n\nSouth Africa struggles with very high levels of crime and violence. Take the crime statistic on murder rates. The country ranks in the top 10 worst countries that report crime statistics according to the most recent data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nCrime rate comparisons between countries are fraught with challenges and should be understood as broad indications rather than accurate quantitative relationships. Nevertheless, South Africa by any measure has a serious crime problem.\n\nWhat insights can be gleaned from the latest annual crime statistics released by South Africa’s police?\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nTo draw meaningful conclusions about longer term trends it is necessary to use rates per 100,000 people in the population. For the last few years South Africa’s police force has opted to publicise only the raw figures for the number of crimes recorded. This doesn’t account for population growth over time, or differences in population sizes between regions or towns.\n\nThe latest numbers had this to reveal about the five key crime types that are particularly worth watching.\n\nMurder rate: this has risen nationally for the fourth year in a row, from 33 per 100,000 in 2014/2015 to 34 per 100,000 last year.\n\nMore concerning than the overall high number of murders, which is by no means a new development, is the fact that its rate of increase has accelerated. Whereas the rise from 2013/2014 to 2014/2015 was by 2.6%, the rise from 2014/2015 to 2015/2016 was by 3.1%. This suggests that the recent increase in fatal violence is not slowing and that South Africa may be in for several more years of increase. The country urgently needs to work out why these increases are happening.\n\nMurder rate in Cape Town: after five bad years, this may finally have turned the corner. Cape Town’s murder rate declined from 63 per 100,000 last year to 62 this year. This is a positive sign, but there is clearly a lot more work to be done. It is still at almost twice the national rate and among the highest in the world.\n\nAggravated robbery trends: The national rates of residential and non- residential robbery showed no decline although the rate at which they increased was smaller than it had been in years. Following the major increases between 2005/2006 and 2008/2009, it seems that relative stability in these crimes may have been reached. Turning them to a decline looks increasingly possible. The police should take heart.\n\nBurglary: Recorded rates of burglary have continued their long and fairly steady decline and are now about a third lower than they were 15 years ago. This should be a comfort given how much this crime contributes to public fear. It does, however, appear that people may have become less inclined to report this crime to the police. The upcoming Victims of Crime Survey should be watched closely to see if this trend continues and to what extent it may be contributing to recorded rates of decline.\n\nDrug-related crime and illegal possession of firearms: There has been a decrease in the recorded rates of drug-related crime for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nThis could be the police’s new back to basics plan in action. Acting head of police Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane has championed a renewed focus on policing fundamentals and areas of under-performance. This may have resulted in resources being directed away from seeking out drug-related crimes.\n\nDepending on where you stand on the issue of the desirability or effectiveness of drug prohibition, this may or may not seem like a good thing.\n\nThe rates of illegal firearm possession have also decreased slightly in the last year.\n\nIt is important to remember that national statistics say very little about how individuals experience crime.

That decline, however, is miniscule, and to focus on that – and other similar trends – in the national crime figures released by police is to ignore an astonishing state of affairs: innocent citizens are being killed and maimed at a rate that makes the country look like a war zone. The reasons for the high crime rate are complex and include legacy apartheid issues. But in reality the ANC government has failed to put a concerted effort into radically overhauling the system so that justice is seen to be done – swiftly. <a href="https://www.biznews.com/category/oscar-pistorius-trial/">The Oscar Pistorius trial</a> reminded the world that beyond those postcard-perfect pictures of Table Mountain, safari parks and pristine seascapes, South Africa has a vicious underbelly – and for that there must be a price to pay in terms of keeping a lid on <a href="https://www.biznews.com/travel/2016/01/12/how-sa-can-win-back-its-global-mojo-tourism-red-tape-initiative/">the tourism industry</a>. For citizens, however, who live their daily lives literally dodging bullets and losing friends and family to crimes that go unpunished, the price must increasingly be a political one.

Expert analysis
Carel	Association of Certified Fraud Examiners	Organization	https://www.forbes.com/sites/riskmap/2016/11/16/combatting-fraud/?sh=7450b4f323d8	By Mason Pan and Allanna Skeels  WASHINGTON--The concepts of fraud and return on investment (ROI) are rarely discussed in the same conversation; nevertheless there is significant merit in exploring the idea of using fraud detection as a proactive opportunity for business growth and a competitive advantage. As businesses face razor thin margins in an increasingly competitive global environment and fraudsters evolve in sophistication, the best offense is a good defense. For executives seeking to increase the competitiveness of their business, preventing fraud and its impacts in a cost efficient and effective way presents a major opportunity to grow the bottom line.  Fraud hits a company in three ways: it causes losses in business revenues (e.g., through illicit payments and disguised sales); it increases operating expenses (e.g., fraud detection and recovery); and as a result it has a serious impact on profitability. The good news is that companies can fight back at fraud by combining smart technology with analytics.  By investing in an intelligence-led, technology-driven data analytics solution, corporate fraud investigators and compliance officials can minimize the occurrence of fraud and recover funds more efficiently than ever. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), victim organizations that lacked anti-fraud controls suffered twice as much in median losses compared to organizations with anti-fraud programs such as proactive data monitoring/analysis systems, management reviews and fraud hotlines 1.  Increasing your bottom line  As fraud detection technology matures, and the return on investment from proactive fraud detection solutions increases, preventing fraud and recovering losses are fast becoming the most cost effective strategies to increasing a corporation’s bottom line. When comparing traditional performance improvement strategies to fraud prevention initiatives, organizations can achieve a greater ROI by implementing fraud detection programs.  For example, a financial institution recently implemented a proactive data analytics solution to monitor and prevent external fraud. The solution combines data aggregation, data analytics and data visualisation to streamline the effectiveness and efficiency of their in-house fraud investigation team. This intelligent solution enabled the team to move from reacting to preventing fraud with material financial recovery. The return on investment was over 1200%.  The true cost of fraud  The losses attributed to fraud often include only the direct costs such as fraud loss itself. Little consideration is given to the slew of negative impacts such as loss to employee morale and reputational damage that follow a fraud event. In an age when customer loyalty can change in the time it takes to read 140 characters, reputational damage can be fatal and non-recoverable. So, when these additional costs are factored into the total cost of fraud, the ROI of an effective fraud prevention program can be even greater. In fact, studies by Nevada University (2014) 2 and Friedrich-Alexander University (2015) 3 identified that companies facing fraud within their senior management team could see 30% erosion to their share price above and beyond the initial loss.  Operational challenges in fighting fraud  As long as there are rules and laws in business, opportunistic fraudsters will find a way to break them. The ACFE estimates that the typical organization loses 5% of annual revenues to fraud.  Besides revenue loss, companies incur operational costs (i.e., labor costs) by dedicating resources and assets to detect, remediate and recover from fraud. In large companies where fraud can be prevalent, fraud investigation units have evolved significantly, but not always at the same pace as the fraudsters themselves. For some global financial institutions, the current state fraud detection program is still the initial pilot program that they implemented years ago and has not been updated or enhanced to keep up with the growing sophistication of fraud.  In addition, human investigators are costly, inefficient and subjective. In large global corporations, critical information needed to detect and assess potential fraud is buried in a myriad of disparate systems that are inaccessible to these costly human investigators. They are forced to manually review and aggregate information needed to assess incidents of potential fraud, with each hour of their time snow balling into huge operational costs.  So how can organizations better combat fraud and achieve a high ROI?  The evolution of technology-driven fraud solutions, such as predictive analytics, may enable companies to rethink their position on the unavoidability of fraud losses. Advancements in technology continue to drive fraud detection costs down, while simultaneously increasing efficiency. Businesses can now generate strong ROI on fraud detection.  The latest evolution of anti-fraud solutions empowers the fraud investigator to drive operational efficiency and lower labor costs in the continuous fight to tackle fraud. These solutions enable the fraud investigator to do the following:  Better detect incidents of potential fraud by using more accurate rules to improve fraud detection precision and reduce the likelihood of false positives. This eliminates wasteful time investigating non-fraudulent incidents Prioritize the focus of investigations by using a risk-based approach so fraud investigators can first review potentially fraudulent transactions that have the highest risk or nominal value. This optimizes the allocation and usage of resources Improve decision making and assessment of fraud through an easy to view and centralized environment, as well as reducing manual tasks to gather, analyze and review information. This increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigators  Organizations can generate a much higher return on investment by implementing an anti-fraud solution that not only reduces time and costs, but makes better use of limited resources. Investing in a solution that helps to secure and protect an organization’s assets in a way that demonstrates clear ROI will be welcomed by executives and financial officers.  Compliance officers can also help their business make smarter decisions by providing accurate information and actionable insights to combat fraud and protect their valuable assets. This cost effective fraud solution not only helps companies reduce their fraud loss and its associated risks, but also make informative business decisions and grow their bottom line.  In summary  Fraud is an inherent risk for organizations, but if compliance officers arm themselves with cost effective solutions such as data analytics to monitor, investigate and recover from fraud, their organizations can achieve a return on investment, better compete in the hyper competitive global market, and insulate their companies from market risks such as fraud. With many companies navigating the fine line between profit and loss, any effort to anticipate and remediate against such risks can prevent the scale of success from irreversibly tipping in the wrong direction.

As businesses face razor thin margins in an increasingly competitive global environment and fraudsters evolve in sophistication, the best offense is a good defense. For executives seeking to increase the competitiveness of their business, preventing fraud and its impacts in a cost efficient and effective way presents a major opportunity to grow the bottom line.\n\nFraud hits a company in three ways: it causes losses in business revenues (e.g., through illicit payments and disguised sales); it increases operating expenses (e.g., fraud detection and recovery); and as a result it has a serious impact on profitability. The good news is that companies can fight back at fraud by combining smart technology with analytics.\n\nBy investing in an intelligence-led, technology-driven data analytics solution, corporate fraud investigators and compliance officials can minimize the occurrence of fraud and recover funds more efficiently than ever. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), victim organizations that lacked anti-fraud controls suffered twice as much in median losses compared to organizations with anti-fraud programs such as proactive data monitoring/analysis systems, management reviews and fraud hotlines 1.\n\nIncreasing your bottom line\n\nAs fraud detection technology matures, and the return on investment from proactive fraud detection solutions increases, preventing fraud and recovering losses are fast becoming the most cost effective strategies to increasing a corporation’s bottom line. When comparing traditional performance improvement strategies to fraud prevention initiatives, organizations can achieve a greater ROI by implementing fraud detection programs.\n\nFor example, a financial institution recently implemented a proactive data analytics solution to monitor and prevent external fraud. The solution combines data aggregation, data analytics and data visualisation to streamline the effectiveness and efficiency of their in-house fraud investigation team. This intelligent solution enabled the team to move from reacting to preventing fraud with material financial recovery. The return on investment was over 1200%.\n\nThe true cost of fraud\n\nThe losses attributed to fraud often include only the direct costs such as fraud loss itself. Little consideration is given to the slew of negative impacts such as loss to employee morale and reputational damage that follow a fraud event. In an age when customer loyalty can change in the time it takes to read 140 characters, reputational damage can be fatal and non-recoverable. So, when these additional costs are factored into the total cost of fraud, the ROI of an effective fraud prevention program can be even greater. In fact, studies by Nevada University (2014) 2 and Friedrich-Alexander University (2015) 3 identified that companies facing fraud within their senior management team could see 30% erosion to their share price above and beyond the initial loss.\n\nOperational challenges in fighting fraud\n\nAs long as there are rules and laws in business, opportunistic fraudsters will find a way to break them. The ACFE estimates that the typical organization loses 5% of annual revenues to fraud.\n\nBesides revenue loss, companies incur operational costs (i.e., labor costs) by dedicating resources and assets to detect, remediate and recover from fraud. In large companies where fraud can be prevalent, fraud investigation units have evolved significantly, but not always at the same pace as the fraudsters themselves. For some global financial institutions, the current state fraud detection program is still the initial pilot program that they implemented years ago and has not been updated or enhanced to keep up with the growing sophistication of fraud.\n\nIn addition, human investigators are costly, inefficient and subjective. In large global corporations, critical information needed to detect and assess potential fraud is buried in a myriad of disparate systems that are inaccessible to these costly human investigators. They are forced to manually review and aggregate information needed to assess incidents of potential fraud, with each hour of their time snow balling into huge operational costs.\n\nSo how can organizations better combat fraud and achieve a high ROI?\n\nThe evolution of technology-driven fraud solutions, such as predictive analytics, may enable companies to rethink their position on the unavoidability of fraud losses.

Carel	Ali Fedotowski	Individual	https://www.etonline.com/ali-fedotowsky-drops-major-bachelorette-hookup-bombshell-on-reunion-special-124740	Monday's special Bachelorette reunion was full of secrets -- but Ali Fedotowsky 's might have been the biggest.  The now-mom of two shockingly revealed to the cameras that while things ended with her former fiance and Bachelorette final pick, Roberto Martinez, she hooked up with another one of her contestants after the show: Frank Neuschaefer.  Fans will remember that Frank broke Ali's heart in Tahiti at final three, revealing that he still had feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Nicole. Though Bachelorette No. 6 ended her time with Frank in tears, they reunited a few years later.  "Honestly, I don't think I've ever told anybody this, but after Roberto and I broke up, I actually went on a date with Frank, and we were romantic for, like, a night!" Ali said on Monday's special, laughing. Ali is now married to radio personality Kevin Manno; they share a 2-year-old daughter, Molly, and a 1-year-old son, Riley.  While speaking with ET last week, Bachelor host Chris Harrison said the Bachelorette reunion held a special place in his heart -- and that most of what went down between the ladies was completely unproduced.  "I really love these women, and I really liked that at the end of the day, we had all these Bachelorettes together for the first time, and we've never done anything like it," he shared.  "They were just sitting around and talking, telling stories of motherhood and just being women today and being Bachelorettes and going through this show and I just thought, 'This is great.' It's just celebrating these badass women doing their thing. And there was no producing, no nothing. It was just raw them," he revealed. "And then having them lined up in the driveway later that night, like, looking from Trista to Becca like, 'Wow, we did this.' Like, all these kickass women doing their thing. I thought it was pretty cool."  The Bachelorette officially kicks off Monday, May 13 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. Join ET's Bachelor Nation Facebook group here.

Carel			https://daily.financialexecutives.org/essential-guide-automating-fraud-detection/	Learn how the implementation and integration of risk and control data analytics helps management identify and respond to red flags, and reduce the risk of fraud escalation.  Data analysis can play a critical role in identifying indicators of fraud in most business process areas. By implementing risk and control data analytics to regularly monitor business transactions – and integrating them into an overall risk and control process—management can identify and respond quickly to red flags, and reduce the risk of fraud escalation.  In this whitepaper on Automating Fraud Detection, you will learn how to achieve results by applying data analysis software in key business areas through a discussion of typical frauds, detection processes and tests. Jump ahead to download this whitepaper here now.  Integrating Fraud Detection through Audit, Risk Management, and Compliance  One of the first issues to consider in implementing a fraud detection program is more of a strategic one: Ownership. Is the organizational objective to integrate fraud detection analytical testing processes into those of overall risk management and control, or is it instead to perform them within a standalone function? The specific technical use of data analysis will not vary much in either case, but the people and process aspects will usually require different considerations.  Data analysis, often in the form of continuous monitoring of transactions and controls, is increasingly used as a key component of risk management and audit processes overall. For many organizations it makes sense to integrate fraud detection objectives into risk management and audit processes, since the risk of fraud is simply one among many risks that an organization faces and should be considered within the full spectrum of risks. In other organizations, there may be a more specific functional area focus on fraud, which necessitates different considerations be given to the practical aspects of implementing data analysis approaches.

For many organizations it makes sense to integrate fraud detection objectives into risk management and audit processes, since the risk of fraud is\xa0simply one among many risks that an organization faces and should be considered within the full spectrum of risks. In other organizations, there may be a more specific functional area focus on fraud, which necessitates different considerations be given to the practical aspects of implementing data analysis approaches.</p>\n\n<p>To continue reading, you can .</p>\n\n</article>', 'datePublishedRaw': '04/18/2016'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	nam	avoid fraud	sebastien		The Essential Guide to Automating Fraud Detection
Shakshi	Fayez al-Sarraj	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayez_al-Sarraj	Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj (Arabic: فائز السراج‎ or فايز السراج; born 20 February 1960) is the head of the Presidential Council of Libya and prime minister [2] of the Government of National Accord of Libya, formed on 17 December 2015 under the Libyan Political Agreement. He has been a member of the Parliament of Tripoli. [3]  Tripoli. [4] He comes from a wealthy family of Kouloughli descent which owned shops and vast amount of land. [5] [6] Al-Sarraj himself is said to be of Turkish origin. [7] His father, Mostafa al-Sarraj was a minister during the Libyan Monarchy. [6] [8] Fayez al-Sarraj trained as an architect and during the Colonel Muammar Gaddafi era he was employed at the Housing Ministry. [9] In 2014, he served as the Minister of Housing and Utilities in the Maiteeq Cabinet of the GNC. [10] His opponents criticized his political appointment as a foreign imposition. [11] An article that appeared in 2016 in The Guardian newspaper quoted Guma el-Gamaty, a member of Libya Dialogue, the UN-chaired body that created the new government, saying that al-Sarraj was "expected to ask for help to combat ISIS and train Libyan units." [12]  Following Libya's 2014 elections, the government became split between the New General National Congress in Tripoli and the internationally recognized legislature of the House of Representatives in Tobruk. [3]  Presidency[ edit ]  In early October 2015 the United Nations envoy to Libya, Bernardino León, proposed a National Unity Government for Libya, to be led by the Presidential Council of Fayez al-Sarraj, as prime minister, three deputies from the country's eastern, western, and southern regions, and two ministers. [13] However, this national unity government was rejected by the internationally recognized legislature in Tobruk and the rival government in Tripoli. [14]  Fayez al-Sarraj, and six members of the Presidential Council and proposed cabinet arrived in Tripoli on 30 March 2016. [15] The following day, it was reported [ undue weight? – discuss ] that the GNA had taken control of the prime ministerial offices and that the GNC appointed prime minister Khalifa al-Ghawil had fled to Misrata. [16] [ unreliable source? ]  On 14 October 2016, forces loyal to GNC took over the building of the High Council of State and announced the comeback of Ghawil cabinet [17] [18] Then, fighting occurred between Sarraj loyalists and Ghawil forces. [19] [20]  On 16 September, al-Sarraj stated that he will be stepping down from his position by the end of October 2020. This has come after one month of protests in Tripoli. [21] [22]  On 31 October 2020, al-Sarraj rescinded his decision to resign. [23]  Government of National Accord[ edit ]  Sarraj with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 16 May 2016  Sarraj has been Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord since its installment in December 2015 as part of a United Nations -led political agreement.  Prior to his initial arrival in Tripoli in March 2016, Sarraj survived two separate assassination attempts. [24]  Over the past two years, the GNA has struggled to gain a foothold as a legitimate institution of authority inside the country, and Libya has remained divided. [25] The government's initial proposed group of ministers was rejected by the House of Representatives (HoR), leading Sarraj to form a government that received a no confidence vote from the HoR. [26] Infighting among rival militias has only intensified, and Libyan citizens have faced economic hardships, including inflation, corruption, and smuggling, that are "melting away the country's cash reserves". [27] [28]  The United Nations representatives who initially formed the unity government have since expressed concern over its ability to make progress. In December 2016, the Security Council noted the "limited authority" of the GNA and stated that "the Libyan Political Agreement did not fulfill the expectations. The implementation has stalled." [29]  Months following this statement, an April 2017 U.N. Security Council meeting summary cautioned that "Libya could relapse into conflict" and said the government has struggled to "deliver basic services while endeavoring to fight terrorism, illegal migration and oil smuggling." [30]  In an attempt to make the government more effective, reports have surfaced throughout 2017 of a consensus to restructure the GNA and overall Libyan Political Agreement. [31] [32]  In July 2018, Libya rejected European Union 's plan aimed at stopping migration from Libya. [33]  On 10 April 2019, United Nations chief António Guterres said, at the UN headquarters, that he still hopes to avoid a "bloody battle for Tripoli". Two days before that, troops loyal to Khalifa Haftar began moving toward the capital. [34]  References[ edit ]		nam	lybia fight and corruption	sebastien		Fayez al-Sarraj
Carel	John Rogers	Individual	https://www.wsfa.com/2020/11/04/state-rep-john-rogers-says-hes-working-get-early-voting-alabama/	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Thousands of Alabamians took advantage of absentee voting in the 2020 Presidential Election leading many to wonder why the state doesn’t offer early voting.  That’s a decision for Alabama lawmakers, and one state representative is already working on it.  Early voting in Alabama is an issue Rep. John Rogers is pushing for right now.  “I’m pre-filing a bill I’m trying to work both sides of the aisle. I’m trying to work with Republicans and Democrats so we can get a chance to vote early,” Rogers said.  “So far, I’ve got all the Democrats. I just got to get a few Republicans to concur,” he explained.  Thousands of voters waited hours in long lines to cast their ballots on Election Day.  And while many took advantage of absentee voting, Rogers said the state needs more ways to accommodate voters.  “It’s a constitutional right to have the right to vote and we should make it easier. By early voting you make it easier for folks to get to the polls and vote,” Rogers said.  His republican colleague, Rep. Danny Garrett agrees.  “I think you could have a process that works that allows people an opportunity to vote and we certainly want people to vote. We want them to exercise that right, and I think we should accommodate them just like we do accommodate people in other areas of life,” Garrett said.  He added that we may not have to wait as long for results with early voting.  “Texas for example, was called fairly early last night and Texas had a large, I want to say it was maybe 70% was early vote. So, they already had that tabulated, so they just added the election day votes and were able to call that pretty quickly,” Garrett explained.  Both representatives said early voting may also encourage more people to get out and vote.  Rep. Garrett said about 62% of Alabama voters turned out for the November 3 election compared to the 15% to 20% at most other elections.

Carel	Securities and Exchange Board India	Organization	https://www.livemint.com/Money/bUoY65Bj8nn5wH4Qfyvm6K/Sebi-gets-new-software-tools-for-fraud-detection-probes.html	Mumbai: With an aim to beef up its capabilities to detect frauds and bring scamsters to book, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is putting in place new software tools to help in its investigations and surveillance activities.  The new tools would help the capital markets watchdog in keeping a close watch on possible manipulative activities in the stock markets by monitoring suspicious trades as also by analysing the information available in the public domain such as on social media and other Internet platforms.  According to a senior official, Sebi has identified enhancement of its market surveillance capabilities as a core focus area for the current financial year.  “Capacity building for effective integrated surveillance particularly of derivatives market is essential so as to align with the ever-changing market dynamics.  “During the year, special focus will be laid on enhancement of skill sets for using analytical and statistical tools to facilitate effective surveillance," he added.  In the budget estimates for the current fiscal 2014-15, Sebi has already accounted for the necessary expenses towards ‘software for investigation work and Fraud Intelligence Software’, sources said, while adding that this project was currently under implementation.  Sebi has already carried out upgradation of its Integrated Market Surveillance System (IMSS), through which it undertakes its market surveillance functions and collects data for suspicious market activities through multiple sources, including its network systems at stock exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions.  Sebi also intends to further beef up in due course its Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence System (DWBIS), which is used for speedy analysis of data and identification of possible violations like insider trading, sources said. For the time being, an intermediate upgradation is being carried out of the DWIBS tool, while an open-tender process may be adopted in some time for further works in this regard.  Sebi already has got a sophisticated surveillance system, which generates at least 100 alerts of suspicious trading activities every day. After following up on all these alerts on various automated parameters, an estimated 8-10 alerts are taken for next-level analysis and therefore investigation and enforcement actions are carried out for necessary cases.  The surveillance systems also track media reports for information being shared among the investors and those are put under scanner that appear suspicious and in violation to the Sebi regulations and model codes of conduct for various entities, including listed companies and market intermediaries.  Sebi has also set up a Forensic Accounting Cell to tackle corporate frauds by listed firms and market entities. The cell also works towards improving the quality of financial information disclosed by the companies, besides assisting in detection of financial irregularities.  To enhance the quality of financial reporting done by listed entities, Sebi has set up a Qualified Audit Report Review (QARC) on which auditing regulator ICAI, stock exchanges and other stakeholders are also represented.  With an aim to strengthen its surveillance functions to detect fraudulent and manipulative activities, Sebi is also planning to study market intelligence infrastructure and techniques of regulators in the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong.  The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others.  The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by Sebi for the current fiscal. The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc.  With regard to Sebi’s capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously.  At present, Sebi’s average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip.  While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation.

Carel	Chin Chang-Ken	Individual	https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/raining-in-the-mountain-kong-shan-ling-yu-film-review	The leader of a monastery calmly juggles the ambitions of those around him in King Hu's wuxia drama.  Another in a string of restorations that in recent years have benefitted fans of wuxia legend King Hu, Raining in the Mountain is one of two pictures the late Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based auteur (most famous for Come Drink with Me and the Cannes favorite A Touch of Zen) made in South Korea. Considerably shorter and more direct than the other Korean project (Legend of the Mountain, which got its first U.S. run in 2018), this 1979 film focuses on mortal ambition and corruption instead of witchcraft, and again, is not for viewers who expect a high ratio of action to dialogue. But patient viewers will find much to enjoy in this parable-like story, which is billed as a heist film but is ultimately less concerned with thievery than with moral justice.  The remote Three Treasures Temple, overseen by a nonagenarian abbot (Chin Chang-Ken), is serene at first glance: set high up a mist-shrouded, forested mountain and populated by monks who spend their days in prayer and contemplation. But it's actually both a place simmering with internal conflict — among the young monks hoping the soon-to-retire abbot will choose them as his successor — and targeted by outsiders: One of the treasures that gives the place its name, a scroll containing the Mahayana Sutra, is a priceless relic that is not very well guarded.  Sadly, some of the abbot's most trusted advisers have designs on that scroll. As he prepares to choose which monk will replace him, the abbot seeks advice from his old friend Esquire Wen (Sun Yueh); a general named Wang (Tien Fung); and a lay Buddhist scholar (Wu Chia-Hsiang) who, though he travels with a coterie of young women, is said to be so spiritually oriented he's "immune to sensual pleasures."  Some if not all of the above have hidden agendas, but we know Wen's from the start: He travels with a servant and a concubine (Ming-Tsai Wu and frequent Hu collaborator Feng Hsu) who are actually cat burglars tasked with stealing the scroll for him. Much of the film's first half hour watches as the two sneak, hide and leap over walls while casing the temple's grounds, interrupted only by scenes introducing other characters and explaining how each fits into local politics.  We're nearly an hour into the picture before seeing anything that could be called action, when a constable named Chang Cheng (Chen Hui-Lou) catches the thieves with a box of pilfered prayer beads. The ensuing game of keep-away plays almost more like choreographed comedy than a fight scene, though, and looks even sillier in comparison to the violence-free but highly charged confrontation that comes next — when the lieutenant bumps into a man he once had imprisoned on false charges.  That convict, Chiu Ming (Tung Lin), purchased the right to become a monk instead of serving his sentence; the movie quickly establishes him as its embodiment of humility and virtue, happy to serve the abbot in any lowly capacity. As with that famous piece of calligraphy, which the abbot often dismisses as a "tattered old scroll," exceptional inner worth often comes in an unimpressive physical package.  Raining will eventually stage some colorful chase sequences through beautifully photographed woods, and Henry Chan's painterly widescreen compositions are well served by this restoration. But the richest thing the film offers lies within the temple's walls: As he did in The Fate of Lee Khan, which was set mostly inside a roadside inn, Hu brings a small space to life as a network of invisible schemes, alliances and ambition. Three or four important monks join the aforementioned characters in pursuit of either the abbot's spiritual blessing or his material possessions; most of them are using someone else as a tool, and few understand they're not the only ones who know how to smile while lying. It's hardly a spoiler to say that the abbot, who talks little and sees much, is not the easiest person to deceive.  Production company: Lo & Hu Company Productions Ltd.

Carel	Laura Reiff	Individual	http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2013-07/01/content_16692653.htm	Re-launched US visa plan lowers cash threshold for potential China migrants  As options to the lackluster stock market or the strictly contained property se cto r, China's expanding middle class is looking to other sources of investment in the hope of getting a profitable return, not just financially but psychologically.  While it may seem odd to encourage investing abroad in a Chinese newspaper headline, an American immigration plan has been re-launched with a lower threshold for would-be immigrant investors who want to improve on an already decent life in China.  The EB-5, a US Immigrant Investor program that offers temporary visas to foreign investors with the possibility of becoming permanent residents, has really taken off in the past three years because of a major change in the rules.  Paradoxically, the revelation of an investment fraud under the policy in January has garnered the program more attention, accompanied, naturally, by growing concerns.  The EB-5 requires foreign investors to pour $1 million into creating projects and jobs in targeted employment areas in the United States. Data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services suggest that 41 percent of all visa recipients in 2011 were Chinese nationals.  An eligible candidate can be anyone who put his or her lawfully gained a sse ts into an investment. However, a permanent green car d is only granted if it leads to the creation of 10 or more full-time jobs.  The program did not take off after regional centers were set up 10 years ago, said Laura Reiff, co-chair of business immigration and compliance practice at Miami-headquartered law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP.  "The program was announced in the early 1990s when the (US) Congress passed the law to attract investors to compete with big migration nations such as Australia and Canada. But not many people want to invest $1 million without knowing for sure they can create jobs," she said.  In 2003, an amendment was passed to the law to set up regional centers that allowed individual investors to put their money together to create bigger and more feasible projects.  A regional center is not merely a defined geographic area but rather is a legally established entity that coo rdinates foreign investment within that area in compliance with the EB-5 statutory, regulatory and precedent decision framework.  Reiff said regional centers are designated by the federal government in terms of geographic areas, allowing them to manage and market projects such as hotels manufacturing facilities, nursing houses and so on. These "quasi-government" agencies interact with the US government and investors on behalf of the projects, but most of them are privately run.  The reform gained added momentum when the benchmark investment amount was cut in half to $500,000, on the premise that the investment is made either in rural areas or in districts with high unemployment rates (considered to be 150 percent of the national average or more).

Dan	Vladimir Voronkov	Induvidual	https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/08/1070922	Vladimir Voronkov, Head of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said the global coronavirus crisis underscored the challenges involved in eliminating terrorism, as he presented the UN Security Council with the latest report on ISIL’s impact on international peace and security.  “This pandemic environment raises several strategic and practical challenges for counter-terrorism, which we discussed during the Virtual Counter-Terrorism Week organized by my Office last month,” he told Council members during video-teleconference briefing.  “ #ISIL & other terrorist groups seek to exploit the far-reaching disruption & negative socio-economic & political impacts of the pandemic.

ISIL expands ‘opportunistic propaganda’ efforts amid pandemic  In non-conflict areas, the threat seems to have decreased in the short term, with COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions apparently lowering the risk of attacks.  However, “opportunistic propaganda efforts” by ISIL could be fuelling an ongoing trend of attacks by individuals and small groups, he said.  Unclear, he added, is how the pandemic is affecting ISIL’s recruitment and fundraising efforts, or whether there is a change in strategic direction under its new leader, Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla. His predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed during a US military operation in Syria in 2019.  Putting a spotlight on regional developments, Mr. Voronkov said that ISIL continues to consolidate its position in some parts of the Middle East previously under its control, “operating increasingly confidently and openly”.  More than 10,000 ISIL fighters are estimated to be active in Iraq and Syria, moving freely in small cells between the two countries, he said, adding that 2020 has seen a “significant increase” in ISIL attacks in both States compared to 2019.  COVID-19 and suspected terrorists  The COVID-19 crisis has further complicated the already dire and unsustainable situation of several thousand people – especially women and children – with suspected links to ISIL. Some countries are still repatriating children, but there has been only limited progress on overcoming legal, political and practical hurdles to repatriation, he said.  “The global threat from ISIL is likely to increase if the international community fails to meet this challenge,” Mr. Voronkov warned, calling for decisive action from Member States on humanitarian, human rights and security grounds.  Turning to Africa, he described Islamic State in West Africa Province and its 3,500 members as a “major focus of ISIL global propaganda” as it reinforces its links with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara – “the most dangerous group in the tri-border area of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger”.  While ISIL has only a few hundred fighters in Libya, it is exploiting tensions between ethnic groups and represents a portent threat capable of broader regional impact, he said, adding that ISIL could potentially expand its activities if the conflict in the North Africa nation escalates.  In Europe, the main threat comes from Internet-driven homegrown terrorist radicalization, he said. Acute concerns surround the release of prisoners with terrorist background and connections, while the rise of right-wing violent extremism means that intelligence services in some European countries are shifting their priorities away from ISIL.  Looking towards Asia, he said that ISIL’s affiliate in Afghanistan, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, remains capable of high-profile attacks - despite territorial losses and the arrest of its leaders - as it seeks to use the country to spread its influence across the region and to attract fighters who oppose the peace agreement between the Taliban and the United States.

Carel	NASAA	Organization	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/scammers-targeting-your-retirement-funds-2013-10-23	At a time when it’s almost impossible to earn much interest on bonds, and equities seem too risky, some retirement savers are investing their individual retirement account in nontraditional investments. But beware of schemes that threaten your retirement, particularly self-directed IRAs.  The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) reports that scam artists pitching self-directed IRAs is now among the top 10 threats facing investors today.  To be sure, self-directed IRAs can be a safe way to invest retirement funds, NASAA said in release. But investors should be mindful of potential fraudulent schemes when considering a self-directed IRA.  By way of background, a self-directed IRA is “an IRA held by a trustee or custodian that permits investment in a broader set of assets than is permitted by most IRA custodians,” according to the SEC. “Most IRA custodians are banks and broker-dealers that limit holdings in IRA accounts to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs. Custodians and trustees for self-directed IRAs, however, may allow investors to invest retirement funds in other types of assets such as real estate, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities.” Read Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud.  These sorts of investments are not inherently bad, but NASAA, SEC and others warn that such investments have unique risks, such as lack of disclosure and liquidity, that must be considered.  What’s more, NASAA is warning investors “fraud promoters pushing a Ponzi scheme or other investment fraud can misrepresent the responsibilities of self-directed IRA custodians in order to deceive investors into believing that their investments are legitimate or protected against losses.”  For the record, custodians and trustees of self-directed IRAs may have limited duties to investors, and generally will not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of an investment or its promoters, NASAA said in its release.  “While a scam artist may suggest that self-directed IRA custodians analyze and validate investments, those custodians only hold the assets in a self-directed IRA and generally do not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of any investment,” NASAA said.  In some cases, NASAA said fraud promoters convince investors to move assets from an existing self-directed or traditional IRA into a fake self-directed IRA held by a supposed custodian created and owned by the scam artist.  And, fraudsters also exploit the tax-deferred characteristics of self-directed IRAs, and know that the financial penalty for early withdrawal may cause investors to be more passive or to keep funds in a fraudulent scheme longer than those who invest through other means, NASAA said.  Meanwhile, IRA experts say there is plenty that investors who want to use self-directed IRAs can do to avoid dealing with scam artists.  What are your goals?  The first item on your punch list when thinking about self-directed IRA is this: Does the investment fit in with your overall plan? “Be sure your IRA investment is consistent with your investment goals, risk tolerances and experiences,” said James Jones, founder and CEO of the Self-Directed IRA Investment Institute and vice president of business development for Kingdom Trust Co.  Jeremy Rettick, an investment adviser representative of BCM and the chief marketing officer of Covenant Reliance Producers, says it’s essential that the investment fits in with your risk profile. “As the old saying goes, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’” said Rettick. “If you decide that a self-directed IRA is the right option for you consider only placing a portion of you total retirement dollars within the plan. As always consider how much risk you are taking on and if it is in line with your overall risk tolerance.”  Invest your time before investing your money  Next, you have to invest your time vetting everything and anything having to do with your self-directed IRA—the investment, the adviser and the custodian—before you invest your money.  Consider first what Rettick calls the “Warren Rule.”  “As Warren Buffett said, ‘Never invest in a business you can’t understand,’” said Rettick. “This philosophy has worked well for Mr. Buffet and could pay dividends to the investor. There are many nontypical investments available within self-directed IRAs. Bottom line he investor needs to understand what they are investing in.”  Jones holds that same point of view. “The most important advice I give daily for investors of self-directed IRAs is: You should know your alternative asset class and more specifically the actual investment better than your financial planner knows stocks, bonds and mutual funds.”  Whether it is real estate, private equity or debt, crowdfunding, precious metals and the like, Jones said “you should already be investing in these categories with good knowledge, experience, networks and advisers.”  And Rob Spalding, the founder and senior adviser with Alternative Solutions Group, noted the following: “Investors should always be vigilant about any investment they make, whether with mutual fund fees or due diligence on a private investment offer involving a self-directed IRA. Ultimately, investors need to be mindful of the investments they make inside or outside of self-directed IRAs.”  Rettick said investors also need to be mindful of the following:  Liquidity: Find out how liquid the investments are. Do you have to keep money invested for a certain period to avoid any early withdraw penalty?  Investment values: Ask how the value of your investments will be calculated on your statements. Custodians may list the value as reported to them by the promoter but the price may not accurately reflect the price at which the investment could be sold.  “Guaranteed” returns: Is the investment FDIC-insured? If not, what is guaranteed and how is it guaranteed?  Fees/commissions: They must share commissions, fees and loads that may apply. Make sure you know what you are paying and if the amount is competitive.  Tax consequences: Talk to an accountant to understand fully the limitations within the plan. The IRS has numerous prohibited transactions that could disqualify the IRA’s tax deferred status forcing you to pay income taxes on the full value of the IRA.  Jones also recommends asking a trusted professional, such as your accountant, lawyer or ﬁnancial adviser, for a second opinion about the proposed self-directed IRA investment by having them review of the investment offering or subscription agreement.  Know your custodian  Besides knowing your investment, it’s imperative that you get to know your custodian and the people behind the investment. “Remember, you are now the investor and adviser,” said Jones. “Due your own extensive due diligence to start, not only the investment offering, but the company and its officers even though you likely know them. You should only invest in asset classes you know, with people that you know. You should never invest with strangers.”  Rettick also recommends you make sure your funds will be held by a credible independent trustee/custodian. “Typically you can talk to your bank, credit union or a well-known custodian,” he said. “If the promoter holds the funds directly that is a huge red flag.”  The trustee/custodian isn't required to conduct due diligence with respect to the quality or suitability of the investment, but they should have in place fraud detection measures. “Ask your IRA custodian what fraud detection measures they have in place, such as checking the company’s good standing with regulators and authorities in the state they do business,” said Jones.  What’s more, Jones noted that neither your IRA custodian nor any governmental agency endorses or guarantees non-FDIC insured investments. “While an IRA custodian can educate investors on alternative asset classes, they can never advise, direct or steer them to an investment,” said Jones. “If an investment sponsor is promoting self-directed IRAs, check with that IRA custodian to see if they in fact have a relationship.”  Additional resources for investors who want to vet their custodians for self-directed IRAs can be found at the Retirement Industry Trust Association (RITA). RITA, according to Spalding, is a trade association for custodians that aims to enhance industry best practices and fight investor fraud.  Work with experienced professionals  The self-directed IRA business has been around for a while, but it’s growing rapidly and there are plenty of newcomers to the business. That’s why Spalding recommends that you work only licensed and regulated advisers.  “Beyond healthy skepticism, self-investigation and asking the investment sponsor for substantial due diligence items, investors should consider working with a licensed financial advisers, especially registered investment advisers or RIAs, who have experience with financial due diligence and alternative investments,” Spalding said. RIAs are generally regulated by the SEC or their state securities division.  Few would argue with the need to vet advisers pitching self-directed IRAs. “They should be properly licensed to sell securities in their state,” said Rettick.  At a minimum, the SEC suggests that you make sure your brokers, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives have not had disciplinary problems or been in trouble with regulators or other investors before you invest or pay for any investment advice. Read Protect Your Money: Check Out Brokers and Investment Advisers. Other resources include the SEC, NASAA, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Watch for red flags  Jones also suggests looking out for fraud red ﬂags including but not limited to an unknown solicitation coming to you, guaranteed investment returns, high pressure sales techniques, short investment decision time lines requiring immediate action to complete the transaction, and too-good-to-be-true statements. “Scam artists know investors decide too often on emotional decisions and not careful analysis,” said Jones. “Be prepared to walk away from every deal, and trust your gut.”  Additionally, with the pending Federal JOBS Act legislation and the formalization of real equity-based crowdfunding, Spalding said the need for investors to be watchful of their investments is only going to intensify.  After you invest  After you’ve opened a self-directed IRA, Jones recommends that you carefully review each account statement and follow up with questions to the investment sponsor if you do not understand it or something doesn't make sense or seems suspicious. “Review these statements with your advisers and never alone,” he said.  Remember too that the IRA custodian maintains your account and forwards account information to you but it is not responsible for any proﬁts or losses on your investments, said Jones.  And, if ever you suspect some suspicious activity related to the investments in your self-directed IRA, Jones says you should report it to your IRA custodian as well as state and federal authorities.

But beware of schemes that threaten your retirement, particularly self-directed IRAs.\n\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) reports that scam artists pitching self-directed IRAs is now among the top 10 threats facing investors today.\n\nTo be sure, self-directed IRAs can be a safe way to invest retirement funds, NASAA said in release. But investors should be mindful of potential fraudulent schemes when considering a self-directed IRA.\n\nBy way of background, a self-directed IRA is “an IRA held by a trustee or custodian that permits investment in a broader set of assets than is permitted by most IRA custodians,” according to the SEC. “Most IRA custodians are banks and broker-dealers that limit holdings in IRA accounts to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs. Custodians and trustees for self-directed IRAs, however, may allow investors to invest retirement funds in other types of assets such as real estate, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities.” Read Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud.\n\nThese sorts of investments are not inherently bad, but NASAA, SEC and others warn that such investments have unique risks, such as lack of disclosure and liquidity, that must be considered.\n\nWhat’s more, NASAA is warning investors “fraud promoters pushing a Ponzi scheme or other investment fraud can misrepresent the responsibilities of self-directed IRA custodians in order to deceive investors into believing that their investments are legitimate or protected against losses.”\n\nFor the record, custodians and trustees of self-directed IRAs may have limited duties to investors, and generally will not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of an investment or its promoters, NASAA said in its release.\n\n“While a scam artist may suggest that self-directed IRA custodians analyze and validate investments, those custodians only hold the assets in a self-directed IRA and generally do not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of any investment,” NASAA said.\n\nIn some cases, NASAA said fraud promoters convince investors to move assets from an existing self-directed or traditional IRA into a fake self-directed IRA held by a supposed custodian created and owned by the scam artist.\n\nAnd, fraudsters also exploit the tax-deferred characteristics of self-directed IRAs, and know that the financial penalty for early withdrawal may cause investors to be more passive or to keep funds in a fraudulent scheme longer than those who invest through other means, NASAA said.\n\nMeanwhile, IRA experts say there is plenty that investors who want to use self-directed IRAs can do to avoid dealing with scam artists.\n\nWhat are your goals?\n\nThe first item on your punch list when thinking about self-directed IRA is this: Does the investment fit in with your overall plan? “Be sure your IRA investment is consistent with your investment goals, risk tolerances and experiences,” said James Jones, founder and CEO of the Self-Directed IRA Investment Institute and vice president of business development for Kingdom Trust Co.\n\nJeremy Rettick, an investment adviser representative of BCM and the chief marketing officer of Covenant Reliance Producers, says it’s essential that the investment fits in with your risk profile. “As the old saying goes, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’” said Rettick. “If you decide that a self-directed IRA is the right option for you consider only placing a portion of you total retirement dollars within the plan.

Custodians and trustees for self-directed IRAs, however, may allow investors to invest retirement funds in other types of assets such as real estate, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities.” Read <a href="http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/sdira.pdf">Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These sorts of investments are not inherently bad, but NASAA, SEC and others warn that such investments have unique risks, such as lack of disclosure and liquidity, that must be considered.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, NASAA is warning investors “fraud promoters pushing a Ponzi scheme or other investment fraud can misrepresent the responsibilities of self-directed IRA custodians in order to deceive investors into believing that their investments are legitimate or protected against losses.”</p>\n\n<p>For the record, custodians and trustees of self-directed IRAs may have limited duties to investors, and generally will not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of an investment or its promoters, NASAA said in its release.</p>\n\n<p>“While a scam artist may suggest that self-directed IRA custodians analyze and validate investments, those custodians only hold the assets in a self-directed IRA and generally do not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of any investment,” NASAA said.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, NASAA said fraud promoters convince investors to move assets from an existing self-directed or traditional IRA into a fake self-directed IRA held by a supposed custodian created and owned by the scam artist.</p>\n\n<p>And, fraudsters also exploit the tax-deferred characteristics of self-directed IRAs, and know that the financial penalty for early withdrawal may cause investors to be more passive or to keep funds in a fraudulent scheme longer than those who invest through other means, NASAA said.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, IRA experts say there is plenty that investors who want to use self-directed IRAs can do to avoid dealing with scam artists.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your goals?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first item on your punch list when thinking about self-directed IRA is this: Does the investment fit in with your overall plan? “Be sure your IRA investment is consistent with your investment goals, risk tolerances and experiences,” said James Jones, founder and CEO of the Self-Directed IRA Investment Institute and vice president of business development for Kingdom Trust Co.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy Rettick, an investment adviser representative of BCM and the chief marketing officer of Covenant Reliance Producers, says it’s essential that the investment fits in with your risk profile. “As the old saying goes, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’” said Rettick. “If you decide that a self-directed IRA is the right option for you consider only placing a portion of you total retirement dollars within the plan. As always consider how much risk you are taking on and if it is in line with your overall risk tolerance.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Invest your time before investing your money</strong></p>\n\n<p>Next, you have to invest your time vetting everything and anything having to do with your self-directed IRA—the investment, the adviser and the custodian—before you invest your money.</p>\n\n<p>Consider first what Rettick calls the “Warren Rule.”</p>\n\n<p>“As Warren Buffett said, ‘Never invest in a business you can’t understand,’” said Rettick. “This philosophy has worked well for Mr. Buffet and could pay dividends to the investor. There are many nontypical investments available within self-directed IRAs. Bottom line he investor needs to understand what they are investing in.”</p>\n\n<p>Jones holds that same point of view. “The most important advice I give daily for investors of self-directed IRAs is: You should know your alternative asset class and more specifically the actual investment better than your financial planner knows stocks, bonds and mutual funds.”</p>\n\n<p>Whether it is real estate, private equity or debt, crowdfunding, precious metals and the like, Jones said “you should already be investing in these categories with good knowledge, experience, networks and advisers.”</p>\n\n<p>And Rob Spalding, the founder and senior adviser with Alternative Solutions Group, noted the following: “Investors should always be vigilant about any investment they make, whether with mutual fund fees or due diligence on a private investment offer involving a self-directed IRA. Ultimately, investors need to be mindful of the investments they make inside or outside of self-directed IRAs.”</p>\n\n<p>Rettick said investors also need to be mindful of the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Find out how liquid the investments are. Do you have to keep money invested for a certain period to avoid any early withdraw penalty?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Investment values:</strong> Ask how the value of your investments will be calculated on your statements. Custodians may list the value as reported to them by the promoter but the price may not accurately reflect the price at which the investment could be sold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“Guaranteed” returns:</strong> Is the investment FDIC-insured? If not, what is guaranteed and how is it guaranteed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fees/commissions:</strong> They must share commissions, fees and loads that may apply. Make sure you know what you are paying and if the amount is competitive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tax consequences:</strong> Talk to an accountant to understand fully the limitations within the plan. The IRS has numerous prohibited transactions that could disqualify the IRA’s tax deferred status forcing you to pay income taxes on the full value of the IRA.</p>\n\n<p>Jones also recommends asking a trusted professional, such as your accountant, lawyer or ﬁnancial adviser, for a second opinion about the proposed self-directed IRA investment by having them review of the investment offering or subscription agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Know your custodian</strong></p>\n\n<p>Besides knowing your investment, it’s imperative that you get to know your custodian and the people behind the investment. “Remember, you are now the investor and adviser,” said Jones. “Due your own extensive due diligence to start, not only the investment offering, but the company and its officers even though you likely know them. You should only invest in asset classes you know, with people that you know. You should never invest with strangers.”</p>\n\n<p>Rettick also recommends you make sure your funds will be held by a credible independent trustee/custodian. “Typically you can talk to your bank, credit union or a well-known custodian,” he said. “If the promoter holds the funds directly that is a huge red flag.”</p>\n\n<p>The trustee/custodian isn\'t required to conduct due diligence with respect to the quality or suitability of the investment, but they should have in place fraud detection measures. “Ask your IRA custodian what fraud detection measures they have in place, such as checking the company’s good standing with regulators and authorities in the state they do business,” said Jones.</p>\n\n<p>What’s more, Jones noted that neither your IRA custodian nor any governmental agency endorses or guarantees non-FDIC insured investments. “While an IRA custodian can educate investors on alternative asset classes, they can never advise, direct or steer them to an investment,” said Jones. “If an investment sponsor is promoting self-directed IRAs, check with that IRA custodian to see if they in fact have a relationship.”</p>\n\n<p>Additional resources for investors who want to vet their custodians for self-directed IRAs can be found at the <a href="http://www.ritausa.org/">Retirement Industry Trust Association (RITA)</a>. RITA, according to Spalding, is a trade association for custodians that aims to enhance industry best practices and fight investor fraud.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Work with experienced professionals</strong></p>\n\n<p>The self-directed IRA business has been around for a while, but it’s growing rapidly and there are plenty of newcomers to the business. That’s why Spalding recommends that you work only licensed and regulated advisers.</p>\n\n<p>“Beyond healthy skepticism, self-investigation and asking the investment sponsor for substantial due diligence items, investors should consider working with a licensed financial advisers, especially registered investment advisers or RIAs, who have experience with financial due diligence and alternative investments,” Spalding said. RIAs are generally regulated by the SEC or their state securities division.</p>\n\n<p>Few would argue with the need to vet advisers pitching self-directed IRAs. “They should be properly licensed to sell securities in their state,” said Rettick.</p>\n\n<p>At a minimum, the SEC suggests that you make sure your brokers, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives have not had disciplinary problems or been in trouble with regulators or other investors before you invest or pay for any investment advice.

Other resources include the <a href="http://www.investor.gov/">SEC</a>, <a href="http://www.nasaa.org/">NASAA</a>, and the <a href="http://www.saveandinvest.org/">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Watch for red flags</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jones also suggests looking out for fraud red ﬂags including but not limited to an unknown solicitation coming to you, guaranteed investment returns, high pressure sales techniques, short investment decision time lines requiring immediate action to complete the transaction, and too-good-to-be-true statements. “Scam artists know investors decide too often on emotional decisions and not careful analysis,” said Jones. “Be prepared to walk away from every deal, and trust your gut.”</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, with the pending Federal JOBS Act legislation and the formalization of real equity-based crowdfunding, Spalding said the need for investors to be watchful of their investments is only going to intensify.</p>\n\n<p><strong>After you invest</strong></p>\n\n<p>After you’ve opened a self-directed IRA, Jones recommends that you carefully review each account statement and follow up with questions to the investment sponsor if you do not understand it or something doesn\'t make sense or seems suspicious. “Review these statements with your advisers and never alone,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Remember too that the IRA custodian maintains your account and forwards account information to you but it is not responsible for any proﬁts or losses on your investments, said Jones.</p>\n\n<p>And, if ever you suspect some suspicious activity related to the investments in your self-directed IRA, Jones says you should report it to your IRA custodian as well as state and federal authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, published by MarketWatch.

Carel	Xi Jinping	Individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/china-s-president-xi-beefs-his-anti-corruption-crackdown-n851491	BEIJING — The next phase of Chinese President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption crackdown will see almost five times as many officials in Beijing under the state's watchful eye, officials said Tuesday.  In the past five years, Xi’s sweeping drive has punished more than 1.5 million corrupt Communist Party officials, including former political rivals and senior military leaders. Observers say such measures have boosted Xi's popularity among ordinary people.  For the first time, authorities gave foreign journalists access to the once-secretive apparatus behind the anti-graft campaign which has helped Xi consolidate his rule. He is now seeking a controversial measure that eliminates term limits and will potentially allow him to remain in power indefinitely.  Beijing has been chosen together with two other provinces to pilot the crackdown's expansion beyond the ruling Communist Party to government officials and people working for state-owned enterprises as well as those providing education, health and other services.  The new measure will leave almost a million officials in China's capital city facing monitoring and regular disciplinary check-ups, a huge increase from the 210,000 previously impacted. Beijing is home to around 21 million people.  “This will ensure that supervision covers everyone working in the public sector who exercises public power,” said Zhang Shuofu, director-general of the newly established Beijing Municipal Supervision Commission.  Both the Communist Party’s disciplinary body and the city government’s watchdog agency will work together in a multi-story office building.  More than 770 officials have been transferred from other departments to bolster this new apparatus.  "Abuse of power, dereliction of duty ... malpractice for personal gains, and waste of state assets," will all be targeted, according to Zhang.  Whistleblowers will be welcomed at a reception hall that can sit 30 people.  “We will insure the identity and legal rights of whistleblowers and protect them from retaliation,” said Liu Zeqing, the reception director.  In severe cases, the commission will employ the new power of “detention” to assist with any investigation. Suspects can be held for three months to six months, with that amount of time potentially deducted from any subsequent term of imprisonment.  "We firmly believe that our political environment will, through tireless efforts, like seas fallen calm and rivers running clean, be clear and free of corruption," Zhang added.

Shakshi	Mustafa Al-Kadhimi	Individual	https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/7/who-is-mustafa-al-kadhimi-iraqs-new-prime-minister	Iraq’s new Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office after the country’s parliament approved a new government on Wednesday following nearly six months of political wrangling.  The parliament approved 15 ministers out of a prospective 22-seat cabinet in a vote of confidence. Five candidates were rejected while voting on two ministers was postponed, leaving seven ministries still empty, including the key oil and foreign affairs positions.  Two previous nominees for the role of prime minister – Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi and Adnan al-Zurfi – failed to secure enough support among cabinet ministers.  This led to President Barham Salih appointing al-Kadhimi as prime minister-designate last month as the third candidate to form a cabinet, amidst a backdrop of anti-government protests.  The protests began in October 2019 after thousands of Iraqis took to the streets and called for the overhaul of what they said was the country’s political and corrupt ruling elite.  Heavy-handed responses by the government security forces, which killed hundreds of protesters, forced then Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to resign, although he remained in a caretaker role until Allawi was appointed in early February.  Before the voting session on the new cabinet on Wednesday, al-Kadhimi said his government would be a “solution-based, not a crisis government”. He promised early elections and rejected the use of Iraq as a battleground by other countries.  The prime minister also pledged to address the repercussions of the economic crisis by rationalising spending and negotiating to restore Iraq’s share of oil exports.  Early life  Born Mustafa Abdellatif Mshatat in 1967 in the capital Baghdad, he left Iraq in 1985 to Iran, before moving to Germany and the United Kingdom, which he later became a citizen of.  He holds a bachelor’s degree in law and is better known for his work as a journalist, where he chose the title of al-Kadhimi.  He was known to oppose the rule of the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, al-Kadhimi returned to Iraq and cofounded the Iraqi Media Network, running in parallel with his work as executive director of the Iraq Memory Foundation, an organisation founded for the purpose of documenting the crimes under Hussein’s Baath regime.  Al-Kadhimi also served as editor-in-chief of Iraq’s Newsweek magazine for three years from 2010. He is also an opinions writer as well as the editor of the Iraq section of the US-based Al-Monitor website.  In June 2016, al-Khadhimi took over the role of director of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, in light of the intensification of the battles against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).  During his tenure, he forged links with dozens of countries and agencies operating within the US-led international coalition against ISIL.  During a rare visit to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, accompanied by former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, al-Kadhimi was seen in a long embrace with his friend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).  Al-Kadhimi is widely viewed by associates and politicians as having a pragmatic mentality in addition to cultivating relations with all the main players across the Iraqi political spectrum: a good relationship with the US, and another that has recently reached out to the Iranians.  Iran and its allied Iraqi Fatah political bloc had previously vetoed al-Kadhimi’s appointment.  Last month, Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed group close to Iran and linked to the Popular Mobilization Units, issued a statement accusing al-Kadhimi of having blood on his hands for the deaths of its leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, and accused him of collaborating with the US.  However, with the oil price crash and the coronavirus pandemic, compromises were made between the Fatah bloc and al-Kadhimi who said he will uphold the muhasasa, or political apportionment system.  Introduced in Iraq after the 2003 US-led invasion in an attempt to provide proportional government representation among Iraq’s various ethno-sectarian groups, many Iraqis believe the system is deeply flawed and acts as a conduit for corruption and political patronage.  According to Iraqi political analyst Hisham al-Hashimi, al-Kadhimi faces no easy task in getting the country back on its feet again.  “I don’t doubt his ability on the technical issues such as forming equitable laws and a fair commission,” al-Hashimi told Al Jazeera.  “He will succeed in preparing for early elections, but the timing is not on his side due to the dire economic conditions and the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.”	[{'query': {'id': '1605095352132-042955785d5c3dd9', 'domain': 'aljazeera.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/7/who-is-mustafa-al-kadhimi-iraqs-new-prime-minister', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/7/who-is-mustafa-al-kadhimi-iraqs-new-prime-minister', 'author': 'Al Jazeera', 'headline': 'Who is Mustafa al-Kadhimi, Iraq’s new prime minister?', 'mainImage': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9044f44ad0fc48a3b4a7d2123b8aba08_18.jpeg?fit=999%2C562', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Iraq’s new Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office after the country’s parliament approved a new government on Wednesday following nearly six months of political wrangling.\n\nThe parliament approved 15 ministers out of a prospective 22-seat cabinet in a vote of confidence.

Carel	IMF	Organization	https://internationalbanker.com/technology/blockchain-aml-harnessing-blockchain-technology-detect-prevent-money-laundering/	The global impact of money laundering is staggering; with related transactions estimated at 2 to 5% of global GDP – amounting to up to $2 trillion. The IMF defines money laundering as a process of conducting financial transactions in a manner that obscures the link between funds and their origin. However, money laundering is more than just a financial crime – performed by criminals and terrorists to finance their illegal activities, it not only hampers the global economy but also poses a threat to security.  Even though anti-money laundering (AML) solutions and regulations are in place across the world, less than 1% of illicit financial flows are currently seized by authorities due to the complex nature of the activity. Global spend on AML compliance is expected to cross $8 billion by 2017, but countries as well as financial institutions are unable to enforce these policies effectively enough to plug the holes in their systems.  It’s clear that traditional AML solutions are unable to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of financial transactions that need to be monitored for laundering activities. Meanwhile, money launderers are constantly discovering more innovative ways to conduct illicit financial transactions, while the institutions attempt to catch up with these increasingly sophisticated criminals. The need of the hour is an innovative technology which can combat money laundering in a scalable, cost-effective and comprehensive manner.  Challenges of Existing AML Solutions  Aging AML solutions are inadequate to meet today’s business challenges and are unprepared for tomorrow’s needs. The existing transaction monitoring systems, based on traditional technology, are unable to keep pace with the growing wave of new digital financial services, including cryptocurrencies. Criminals have begun leveraging these emerging channels for their money laundering activities, making it even harder for authorities to trace them.  Unlike traditional financial transactions that require financial institutions as intermediaries, crypto and other digital routes are faster, encrypted for greater security, often anonymous and in most parts of the world, remain unregulated by governments till date. Existing AML solutions are not equipped to investigate these highly encrypted and P2P forms of financial transactions yet.  Secondly, most AML efforts that are currently implemented are highly individualistic in nature, with each financial institution deploying its own solution and every country having its own laws to prevent money laundering. There is also not enough standardization and the lack of collaboration makes money laundering more challenging to detect and act against.  Rising globalization has caused an exponential increase in cross-border financial transactions. The volume and complexity of financial transactions have increased manifold. Without automation, end-to-end analytics and limited visualization capabilities, traditional transaction monitoring tools and solutions are being rendered ineffective.  Blockchain for AML Transaction Monitoring  Blockchain is essentially a cryptographic ledger comprising of a digital log of transactions which can be shared across a public or private network. The technology, by its very nature, lends itself to integrated decentralized monitoring efforts of financial transactions.  An anti-money laundering system built on the blockchain can leverage the cryptographically secure, decentralized and immutable nature of the technology to identify and stop suspicious transactions effectively. A distributed blockchain-based system using ‘smart-contracts’ with inbuilt algorithms, will allow financial institutions to securely parse data through an AML engine on the blockchain; with the automation providing high efficiency and ensuring minimum friction.  Each financial institution which would be part of this system would serve as a node within the private permissioned blockchain network, and would use the network directory and smart contracts to record transactions on the blockchain.  Since relevant information would be stored in the blockchain and be made available to each node, suspicious activity can be detected and highlighted to all related participants. Alerts can then be issued to stakeholders and the transaction can automatically be flagged and stopped for further investigation. The blockchain network is immediately updated with the record of such an alert in an immutable and tamper-proof manner.  A blockchain-based AML platform makes it possible for regulatory authorities, risk officers, auditors and other relevant stakeholders to monitor complex transactions in an automated and effective manner, as well as immutably record audit trails of suspicious transactions across the system.  The design of the blockchain can ensure compliance with data sovereignty laws while complementing existing legacy AML solutions, enhancing their effectiveness by adding an additional layer of scrutiny and visibility. The overall platform based on blockchain can be used by participating financial institutions to instantly alert each other about any potentially fraudulent transactions and flag them for further investigation.  Getting started – harnessing the potential of Blockchain for AML transaction monitoring  Any risk executive looking to harness the potential of blockchain for AML within a financial institution, auditory or regulatory authority should consider the following methodology to get started:  Understand application of Blockchain for AML and secure executive sponsorship – Before embarking on a blockchain project, it is imperative to get a good understanding of distributed ledger technology and how it can be leveraged for AML transaction monitoring.  Form a working group, validate hypothesis and design a PoC engagement to get started with – Identify a core team with representation from across stakeholder groups to collaboratively work on the initiative. Engage external experts to form a well-rounded and well-informed team. On-board participants and kick-off the project – Set up a lab-like environment. Start small. Begin with a few select cases/red flag triggers that can be showcased to a wider audience to highlight benefits and prime adoption.  Develop the prototype for select use cases – Use the experimental environment and a technical team to set up the blockchain network, develop the application and deploy the smart contracts  Evaluate the prototype(s) and pick the ones most promising for mainstream deployment – Once the prototype(s) are developed, tested rigorously by the team and validated by the stakeholders, select winners that can be adopted and piloted on an enterprise-wide level.  Considerations for Mainstream Deployment of Blockchain-based AML Solution  The technology is still in its early days and use cases exploring the potential of blockchain are isolated and limited. However, to truly realize their potential, implementations of blockchain based solutions for AML need to be integrated into the core IT landscape within each participating institution.  If deployed within a bank to connect its various globally dispersed branches, the decentralized system will complement existing legacy AML applications and add an extra ring of scrutiny and visibility.  Leveraging a blockchain platform for AML nationwide or across a geographical region will give regulators, auditors and other stakeholders an effective and powerful set of tools to monitor complex transactions and immutably record the audit trail of suspicious transactions across the system. However, this will need cross-industry participation and require buy-in from leaders across regulatory authorities as well as the participating banks and other financial institutions.  Either way, it’s only a matter of time before financial institutions and regulators adopt distributed ledger technology to connect, gain visibility and collaboratively prevent money laundering.

The need of the hour is an innovative technology which can combat money laundering in a scalable, cost-effective and comprehensive manner.\n\nChallenges of Existing AML Solutions\n\nAging AML solutions are inadequate to meet today’s business challenges and are unprepared for tomorrow’s needs. The existing transaction monitoring systems, based on traditional technology, are unable to keep pace with the growing wave of new digital financial services, including cryptocurrencies. Criminals have begun leveraging these emerging channels for their money laundering activities, making it even harder for authorities to trace them.\n\nUnlike traditional financial transactions that require financial institutions as intermediaries, crypto and other digital routes are faster, encrypted for greater security, often anonymous and in most parts of the world, remain unregulated by governments till date. Existing AML solutions are not equipped to investigate these highly encrypted and P2P forms of financial transactions yet.\n\nSecondly, most AML efforts that are currently implemented are highly individualistic in nature, with each financial institution deploying its own solution and every country having its own laws to prevent money laundering. There is also not enough standardization and the lack of collaboration makes money laundering more challenging to detect and act against.\n\nRising globalization has caused an exponential increase in cross-border financial transactions. The volume and complexity of financial transactions have increased manifold. Without automation, end-to-end analytics and limited visualization capabilities, traditional transaction monitoring tools and solutions are being rendered ineffective.\n\nBlockchain for AML Transaction Monitoring\n\nBlockchain is essentially a cryptographic ledger comprising of a digital log of transactions which can be shared across a public or private network. The technology, by its very nature, lends itself to integrated decentralized monitoring efforts of financial transactions.\n\nAn anti-money laundering system built on the blockchain can leverage the cryptographically secure, decentralized and immutable nature of the technology to identify and stop suspicious transactions effectively. A distributed blockchain-based system using ‘smart-contracts’ with inbuilt algorithms, will allow financial institutions to securely parse data through an AML engine on the blockchain; with the automation providing high efficiency and ensuring minimum friction.\n\nEach financial institution which would be part of this system would serve as a node within the private permissioned blockchain network, and would use the network directory and smart contracts to record transactions on the blockchain.\n\nSince relevant information would be stored in the blockchain and be made available to each node, suspicious activity can be detected and highlighted to all related participants. Alerts can then be issued to stakeholders and the transaction can automatically be flagged and stopped for further investigation. The blockchain network is immediately updated with the record of such an alert in an immutable and tamper-proof manner.\n\nA blockchain-based AML platform makes it possible for regulatory authorities, risk officers, auditors and other relevant stakeholders to monitor complex transactions in an automated and effective manner, as well as immutably record audit trails of suspicious transactions across the system.\n\nThe design of the blockchain can ensure compliance with data sovereignty laws while complementing existing legacy AML solutions, enhancing their effectiveness by adding an additional layer of scrutiny and visibility. The overall platform based on blockchain can be used by participating financial institutions to instantly alert each other about any potentially fraudulent transactions and flag them for further investigation.\n\nGetting started – harnessing the potential of Blockchain for AML transaction monitoring\n\nAny risk executive looking to harness the potential of blockchain for AML within a financial institution, auditory or regulatory authority should consider the following methodology to get started:\n\nUnderstand application of Blockchain for AML and secure executive sponsorship – Before embarking on a blockchain project, it is imperative to get a good understanding of distributed ledger technology and how it can be leveraged for AML transaction monitoring.\n\nForm a working group, validate hypothesis and design a PoC engagement to get started with – Identify a core team with representation from across stakeholder groups to collaboratively work on the initiative. Engage external experts to form a well-rounded and well-informed team.\nOn-board participants and kick-off the project – Set up a lab-like environment. Start small. Begin with a few select cases/red flag triggers that can be showcased to a wider audience to highlight benefits and prime adoption.\n\nDevelop the prototype for select use cases – Use the experimental environment and a technical team to set up the blockchain network, develop the application and deploy the smart contracts\n\nEvaluate the prototype(s) and pick the ones most promising for mainstream deployment – Once the prototype(s) are developed, tested rigorously by the team and validated by the stakeholders, select winners that can be adopted and piloted on an enterprise-wide level.\n\nConsiderations for Mainstream Deployment of Blockchain-based AML Solution\n\nThe technology is still in its early days and use cases exploring the potential of blockchain are isolated and limited. However, to truly realize their potential, implementations of blockchain based solutions for AML need to be integrated into the core IT landscape within each participating institution.\n\nIf deployed within a bank to connect its various globally dispersed branches, the decentralized system will complement existing legacy AML applications and add an extra ring of scrutiny and visibility.\n\nLeveraging a blockchain platform for AML nationwide or across a geographical region will give regulators, auditors and other stakeholders an effective and powerful set of tools to monitor complex transactions and immutably record the audit trail of suspicious transactions across the system. However, this will need cross-industry participation and require buy-in from leaders across regulatory authorities as well as the participating banks and other financial institutions.\n\nEither way, it’s only a matter of time before financial institutions and regulators adopt distributed ledger technology to connect, gain visibility and collaboratively prevent money laundering.', 'authorsList': ['Floyd DCosta'], 'breadcrumbs': [{'link': 'https://internationalbanker.com', 'name': 'Home'}, {'link': 'https://internationalbanker.com/technology/', 'name': 'Technology'}, {'link': 'https://internationalbanker.com/technology/blockchain-aml-harnessing-blockchain-technology-detect-prevent-money-laundering/', 'name': 'Blockchain for AML – Harnessing Blockchain Technology to Detect and Prevent Money Laundering'}], 'description': 'The global impact of money laundering is staggering; with related transactions estimated at 2 to 5% of global GDP – amounting to up to $2 trillion.

Shakshi	Barham Salih	Individual	https://historica.fandom.com/wiki/Barham_Salih	Barham Salih (born 1960) was Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq from 2004 to 2009 and Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan from 2009 to 2012 (under Massoud Barzani). In 2014 he ran for President of Iraq but lost, with his 17 votes against 21 votes for Fuad Masum.  Biography  Salih was born in Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan and joined the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) movement in late 1976 and later the PUK resistance in 1979, when he was arrested by the Iraqi Army. He was tortured in prison, and when he was released he continued his high schooling, with a 96.5% grade. After continuous persecution, he left for the United Kingdom to flee Iraq. He graduated for civil engineering from the University of Cardiff in 1983 and the University of Liverpool in 1987, and after the Gulf War of 1990-91 he was made head of the PUK office in the United States.  After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship in Iraq in 2003 he became involved in politics again, first serving as interim Deputy Prime Minister and then official Deputy Prime Minister from 2004 to 2009, when he became Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan under Massoud Barzani. He served until 2012, and in 2014 he ran for president in the Shi'a and Kurdish-ruled government of Iraq, but lost 17-24 votes against Fuad Masum, a fellow Kurd.

Carel	Sasha Hutchison	Individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586	We are all getting back to the basics.  While it might feel good to bake bread, the best way to get through the coronavirus pandemic could be to stock your emergency fund and learn to “do-it-yourself” with household chores so you can save on expenses.  One bright spot: You might have more time on your hands.  Think optimistically. You can learn to DIY, sock away cash and set a disaster budget for tough times.  If you’ve been putting off thinking about money, now’s the time to dedicate those extra hours in the week — no more commuting, no more rushed work mornings — to shoring up your finances.  Hold off on panicking by looking ahead, says Sasha Hutchison, 38, an accounting manager and personal finance blogger in Austin, Texas.  Take a look at your net worth: what you owe, what you can do to bring in cash now. “It helps you to feel more in control,” Hutchison said.  When Hutchison says to look at everything, she means everything. A health savings account or a flexible spending account through your job can help pay for health care. How much cash do you have on hand? What’s in your portfolio, even if it’s shrinking? It might be a difficult time to collect from anyone who owes you money — but still good to know that it’s out there.  Cash-back credit cards can be another source. Groceries and gas help accumulate points quickly. (Hutchison pays off the balance each month.)  An emergency fund is more critical than ever. In one week in March, things changed almost daily, says Liz Gendreau, 39, who blogs about family finance on her website, Chief Mom Officer.  “You might get reduced hours, a pay cut,” said Gendreau, who lives in Hartford County, Connecticut. “Before that happens, ideally, is the time to take a really close look at your budget.”  You’ll never regret having emergency savings — only not saving while you had the chance.  When things go back to the way they were, you can use that pile of cash to pay off debt or for something you wanted to do.  A budget for slim times  Got a budget? That’s great. Now might be a very good time to create and use the emergency version.  According to Heather Albrecht, 37, a financial coach in Hartford, Vermont, it’s best to make this plan before you need it. It’s so much easier when you don’t look for things to cut under duress. Write it down, so you can pull it out and see the plan you’ve made.  What small luxuries do you want to keep? What you can live without? The more you cut, the longer you can make savings last.  “Be ruthless,” Albrecht said. “You can always add in things if you feel you can’t live without them.”  Rabbi Steve Leder on finding a silver lining in hardship  May 27, 202006:14  Hello, DIY  Many people outsource practically everything, from housecleaning to yard work to delivery services, says Tara Koup, 43, a writer for QVC who lives in Paoli, Pennsylvania.  Koup says these practical skills are a top way to save.  In the pre-Covid-19 world, people turned to pros because they were busy and pressured.  But more time at home means less of an excuse to avoid learning to cook, clean, conserve, reuse.  “I use what is around me for free instead of purchasing,” Koup said. “Living simply is a good way to save money in the long run.”	[{'query': {'id': '1605093046850-af11870724f37da5', 'domain': 'nbcnews.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586', 'author': 'Jill Cornfield, CNBC', 'images': ['https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/tdy_news_10a_leder_200527_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg', 'https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_08/3236041/200219-taxes-al-1501_f92388c1bac207ab190750247d04d91a.fit-760w.jpg', 'https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_08/3236041/200219-taxes-al-1501_f92388c1bac207ab190750247d04d91a.fit-2000w.jpg'], 'headline': 'These simple financial tweaks can help you survive — and even thrive — during the pandemic', 'mainImage': 'https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_08/3236041/200219-taxes-al-1501_f92388c1bac207ab190750247d04d91a.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'We are all getting back to the basics.\n\nWhile it might feel good to bake bread, the best way to get through the coronavirus pandemic could be to stock your emergency fund and learn to “do-it-yourself” with household chores so you can save on expenses.\n\nOne bright spot: You might have more time on your hands.\n\nThink optimistically.

You can learn to DIY, sock away cash and set a disaster budget for tough times.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve been putting off thinking about money, now’s the time to dedicate those extra hours in the week — no more commuting, no more rushed work mornings — to <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/faqs-about-money-management-during-the-coronavirus/">shoring up your finances</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Hold off on panicking by looking ahead, says Sasha Hutchison, 38, an accounting manager and <a href="http://www.yourfrugalfriendblog.com/">personal finance blogger</a> in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at your net worth: what you owe, what you can do to bring in cash now. “It helps you to feel more in control,” Hutchison said.</p>\n\n<p>When Hutchison says to look at everything, she means everything. A health savings account or a flexible spending account through your job can help pay for health care. How much cash do you have on hand? What’s in your portfolio, even if it’s shrinking? It might be a difficult time to collect from anyone who owes you money — but still good to know that it’s out there.</p>\n\n<p>Cash-back credit cards can be another source. Groceries and gas help accumulate points quickly. (Hutchison pays off the balance each month.)</p>\n\n<p>An <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-how-to-build-a-cash-cushion-as-outbreak-spreads.html">emergency fund</a> is more critical than ever. In one week in March, things changed almost daily, says Liz Gendreau, 39, who blogs about family finance on her website, <a href="https://chiefmomofficer.org/">Chief Mom Officer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“You might get reduced hours, a pay cut,” said Gendreau, who lives in Hartford County, Connecticut. “Before that happens, ideally, is the time to take a really close look at your budget.”</p>\n\n<p>You’ll never regret having emergency savings — only not saving while you had the chance.</p>\n\n<p>When things go back to the way they were, you can use that pile of cash to pay off debt or for something you wanted to do.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586#anchor-Abudgetforslimtimes"><h2>A budget for slim times</h2></a></p>\n\n<p>Got a budget? That’s great. Now might be a very good time to create and use the emergency version.</p>\n\n<p>According to Heather Albrecht, 37, a <a href="https://www.balancefinancialcoaching.com/">financial coach</a> in Hartford, Vermont, it’s best to make this plan before you need it. It’s so much easier when you don’t look for things to cut under duress. Write it down, so you can pull it out and see the plan you’ve made.</p>\n\n<p>What small luxuries do you want to keep? What you can live without? The more you cut, the longer you can make savings last.</p>\n\n<p>“Be ruthless,” Albrecht said. “You can always add in things if you feel you can’t live without them.”</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.today.com/video/rabbi-steve-leder-on-finding-a-silver-lining-in-hardship-83965509573"><source srcset="https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/tdy_news_10a_leder_200527_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg"><source srcset="https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/tdy_news_10a_leder_200527_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg"><img src="https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202005/tdy_news_10a_leder_200527_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg"></source></source></a></p>\n\n<h2><a href="https://www.today.com/video/rabbi-steve-leder-on-finding-a-silver-lining-in-hardship-83965509573">Rabbi Steve Leder on finding a silver lining in hardship</a></h2>\n\n<p>May 27, 202006:14</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586#anchor-HelloDIY"><h2>Hello, DIY</h2></a></p>\n\n<p>Many people outsource practically everything, from housecleaning to yard work to delivery services, says Tara Koup, 43, a writer for QVC who lives in Paoli, Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Koup says these practical skills are a top way to save.</p>\n\n<p>In the pre-Covid-19 world, people turned to pros because they were busy and pressured.</p>\n\n<p>But more time at home means less of an excuse to avoid learning to cook, clean, conserve, reuse.</p>\n\n<p>“I use what is around me for free instead of purchasing,” Koup said. “Living simply is a good way to save money in the long run.”</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-05-27T19:51:50.000Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-05-27T17:57:00.000Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]	random	budget management tips	sebastien		These simple financial tweaks can help you survive — and even thrive — during the pandemic

Canberk	Experian	Company	https://www.zdnet.com/article/experian-south-africa-discloses-data-breach-impacting-24-million-customers/	The South African branch of consumer credit reporting agency Experian disclosed a data breach on Wednesday.  The credit agency admitted to handing over the personal details of its South African customers to a fraudster posing as a client.  While Experian did not disclose the number of impacted users, a report from South African Banking Risk Centre (SABRIC), an anti-fraud and banking non-profit, claimed the breach impacted 24 million South Africans and 793,749 local businesses.  Experian said it reported the incident to local authorities, which were able to track down the individual behind the incident. Since then, Experian said it obtained a court order, "which resulted in the individual's hardware being impounded and the misappropriated data being secured and deleted."  Experian said that none of the data has been used for fraudulent purposes before being deleted and that the fraudster did not compromise its infrastructure, systems, or customer database.  "Our investigations indicate that an individual in South Africa, purporting to represent a legitimate client, fraudulently requested services from Experian," the agency said in a statement.  "Our investigations also show that the suspect had intended to use the data to create marketing leads to offer insurance and credit-related services."  According to Experian, only personal information was exposed in the incident, and no financial or credit-related information was involved.  The credit reporting agency described the shared data as "information which is provided in the ordinary course of business or which is publicly available."  Nonetheless, the data was deemed personal enough for South African privacy regulators to open a case in regards to the incident.

Carel	OFAC	Organization	https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/12824/corporates-and-compliance---avoid-fines-and-reputational-damage	Action against corporates by financial regulators demonstrating they are widening their focus and bringing corporates into the world of financial crime compliance is well documented. Non-compliance can attract heavy fines and the risk of reputational damage which would be considered reckless, at best.  Regulations to combat financial crime include anti-money laundering (AML) laws, financial sanctions and monitoring of high-risk individuals. Sanctions are among the most challenging of the financial crime regulations for corporations. In addition to jurisdictional issues, operational decisions on matters such as sanctions list management, transaction currency, customer or employee nationality, local employment laws and transaction routing must be considered.  The multi-jurisdictional challenge  The majority of economic sanctions emanate from the US and Europe. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has recently fined a number of firms – including those operating outside of the US – for sanctions violations. In fact, three of the four entities fined by OFAC for sanctions violations early this year, were corporations and compliance experts believe that the size and scale of fines for corporates is set to grow.  OFAC administers a number of different sanctions programs, covering countries such as Syria, Iran and Russia as well as ‘specially designated nationals’ (SDNs) who are defined in almost 60 different lists. The sanctions are either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to meet the foreign policy and national security goals of the US.  Other countries, such as the UK and France, have similar bodies to monitor those suspected of financial crime.  Corporates playing catchup  With regulators clearly signalling their intention to take a closer look at corporate compliance with international sanctions, making the assumption that a bank is responsible for protecting its corporate clients against potential violations will not be a mitigating factor when it comes to regulatory action.  As businesses expand across borders, the exposure to potential violations increases and can extend to off-shore affiliates. Many corporates are playing catch up with their understanding of regulatory responsibilities and as their knowledge increases, so does their concern that their internal processes may need to be more robust.  It is true to say that financial crime compliance affects every industry, but some sectors will be more highly exposed to potential violations because of the countries in which they operate, others because of the individuals or institutions with whom they do business.  Airlines, logistics, oil exploration and pharmaceuticals have been relatively proactive in managing their risk, while those companies that operate predominantly in perceived ‘risky’ jurisdictions have likely been sensitised to the importance of compliance.  There are a number of ways in which corporates can address the issue of regulatory compliance:  #1 Screening financial transactions is a very effective way to mitigate the risk of sanctions violations. This has the added benefit that corporations not only assure themselves that the transaction is compliant, but they can avoid payment blockages where a query on a single transaction could hold up all the remaining payments in a batch. Corporate treasury departments can expedite payments and improve straight-through processing.  #2 Screening customers and suppliers during the on-boarding process is vital, ongoing screening is essential. Checks are made against lists issued by various bodies (including OFAC) to ensure that the countries, companies or individuals with whom they deal are not subject to sanctions.  #3 Sanctions list management is recognised as a challenging task. The lists change regularly, sometimes daily, with names of entities and individuals being added and subtracted. As such, customer and supplier databases would need to be screened regularly to maintain ongoing compliance. Diligence is mandatory, as the job of managing sanctions lists and updating sanctions filters is both complex and time consuming.  #4 Beyond your borders. Although it may be obvious it is worth considering the example that companies operating in the US must comply with US regulations in their everyday business activities, it may not have been as clear that this obligation also extends to organisations outside of the US that are buying US goods, trading in US dollars or have US staff on their payroll who are involved in payment processing.  The onus is on the corporate to be compliant and it must be a high priority to implement effective controls.  Creating a framework for the future  Fighting financial crime remains a high priority for regulators and governments across the world. Regulators and policy makers, although initially focused on the financial industry, are now widening their net to include the broader corporate community.  Corporates can learn from the financial industry and incorporate financial crime compliance into the day-to-day management of their business.  Regulatory compliance costs are going to increase as businesses expand into new countries and every effort has to be made to identify how regulations may affect their business. Implementing practical steps to ensure their compliance is fit for purpose will not only protect reputation and avoid fines; it will ensure their business can prosper as it expands to new territories.  6026	[{'query': {'id': '1605370895006-10f52009b449e774', 'domain': 'finextra.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/12824/corporates-and-compliance---avoid-fines-and-reputational-damage', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/12824/corporates-and-compliance---avoid-fines-and-reputational-damage', 'author': 'Editorial Team', 'headline': 'Corporates and compliance - avoid fines and reputational damage', 'mainImage': 'https://www.finextra.com/finextra-images/member_photos/thumb_84672_robert_scheider.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Action against corporates by financial regulators demonstrating they are widening their focus and bringing corporates into the world of financial crime compliance is well documented.

Sanctions are among the most challenging of the financial crime regulations for corporations. In addition to jurisdictional\n issues, operational decisions on matters such as sanctions list management, transaction currency, customer or employee nationality, local employment laws and transaction routing must be considered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The multi-jurisdictional challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>The majority of economic sanctions emanate from the US and Europe. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has recently fined a number of firms – including those operating outside of the US – for sanctions violations. In fact,\n three of the four entities fined by OFAC for sanctions violations early this year, were corporations and compliance experts believe that the size and scale of fines for corporates is set to grow.</p>\n\n<p>OFAC administers a number of different sanctions programs, covering countries such as Syria, Iran and Russia as well as ‘specially designated nationals’ (SDNs) who are defined in almost 60 different lists. The sanctions are either comprehensive or selective,\n using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to meet the foreign policy and national security goals of the US.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries, such as the UK and France, have similar bodies to monitor those suspected of financial crime.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Corporates playing catchup</strong></p>\n\n<p>With regulators clearly signalling their intention to take a closer look at corporate compliance with international sanctions, making the assumption that a bank is responsible for protecting its corporate clients against potential violations will not be\n a mitigating factor when it comes to regulatory action.</p>\n\n<p>As businesses expand across borders, the exposure to potential violations increases and can extend to off-shore affiliates.\xa0 Many corporates are playing catch up with their understanding of regulatory responsibilities and as their knowledge increases, so\n does their concern that their internal processes may need to be more robust.</p>\n\n<p>It is true to say that financial crime compliance affects every industry, but some sectors will be more highly exposed to potential violations because of the countries in which they operate, others because of the individuals or institutions with whom they\n do business.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines, logistics, oil exploration and pharmaceuticals have been relatively proactive in managing their risk, while those companies that operate predominantly in perceived ‘risky’ jurisdictions have likely been sensitised to the importance of compliance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are a number of ways in which corporates can address the issue of regulatory compliance:</strong></p>\n\n<p>#1 <strong>Screening financial transactions</strong> is a very effective way to mitigate the risk of sanctions violations. This has the added benefit that corporations not only assure themselves that the transaction is compliant, but they can avoid payment blockages\n where a query on a single transaction could hold up all the remaining payments in a batch. Corporate treasury departments can expedite payments and improve straight-through processing.</p>\n\n<p>#2 <strong>Screening customers and suppliers</strong> during the on-boarding process is vital, ongoing screening is essential. Checks are made against lists issued by various bodies (including OFAC) to ensure that the countries, companies or individuals with whom\n they deal are not subject to sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>#3 <strong>Sanctions list management</strong> is recognised as a challenging task.

Shakshi	Hassan Rouhani	Individual	https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hassan-Rouhani	Presidency and diplomacy  Following Rouhani’s inauguration in August, he launched a diplomatic campaign to improve Iranian engagement with the West. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Rouhani criticized international sanctions against Iran but emphasized his country’s willingness to seek compromise over the Iranian nuclear program. His conciliatory overtures led to a telephone call with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama in late September, the first direct conversation between a U.S. and an Iranian leader since 1979.  Rouhani’s pledge to restart international dialogue regarding Iran’s nuclear activities was fulfilled in early November with the opening of talks between Iran and a group comprising the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (known collectively as the P5+1). By the end of the month, an interim agreement had been reached that eased sanctions on Iran and placed a variety of restrictions on the nuclear program. A final agreement was reached in July 2015 that required Iran to reduce its nuclear stockpile and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities in exchange for gradual reduction of sanctions. Speaking after the agreement was reached, Rouhani said that it would help build trust between Iran and the West. In January 2016, UN inspectors certified that Iran had made satisfactory progress toward achieving its objectives under the nuclear agreement. This triggered the lifting of international sanctions. The reintegration of Iran’s economy—especially the petroleum and finance sectors—with the global economy had immediate macroeconomic benefits; GDP growth rose sharply and inflation dropped under 10 percent for the first time since the 1990s.  Rouhani won a second term as president by a landslide in May 2017, winning 57 percent of the vote to 38 percent for his nearest competitor, the conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi. The election results were largely interpreted as a referendum on the nuclear agreement. Rouhani benefited from the enthusiastic support of young Iranians eager for greater economic opportunity and more international engagement. Nonetheless, many Iranians failed to see significant economic improvement in their everyday lives, leading to massive demonstrations in December 2017.  In May 2018 U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear agreement and that sanctions would be reimposed. Other signatories to the treaty agreed to uphold it, though many businesses based in those countries pulled out of Iran and a significant amount of international trade with Iran was cut because of the United States’ far-reaching sanctions. Rouhani began to take a harder line, and Iran made a show of military exercises, ballistic missile testing, and satellite launches. These moves were met with disapproval from some of the other signatories, who warned that such activities would spread distrust and undermine the agreement.  As it became clear in 2019 that the other signatories could not guarantee the benefits of the agreement, Rouhani announced in May of that year that Iran would begin breaching the agreement. The Iranian government gradually pulled back from its commitments and began carrying out attacks in the region, including in the Gulf of Oman.  In mid-November, as sanctions continued to bite, Rouhani announced that the government would raise fuel prices. Protests erupted across the country, prompting a brutal crackdown accompanied by an unprecedented Internet blackout.

Carel	Ahmad Maslan	Individual	https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ahmad-maslan-defends-najib-says-pm-not-stupid-take-government-money	(July 10): Datuk Ahmad Maslan has defended Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, saying the prime minister is not that stupid to take government money following The Wall Street Journal ’s (WSJ) report that US$700 million (RM2.67 billion) was transferred into his personal bank accounts.  The deputy finance minister also said Najib was not such a person to take government money and Malaysians should not trust the global business newspaper.  "What kind of stupid prime minister would take RM2.46 billion in funds from a government agency into his personal account?  "This is an improbability (kemusaliran) of the greatest kind. If it is true, it is a stupidity (kebebalan yang terlau amat sangat) of the greatest kind," he said.  "The prime minister has told us that the information is 100% not true. Don't worry, he is not that kind of person. We should not be like WSJ to believe in such weird news," Ahmad said in his speech at the closing ceremony for the Customs Department's nationwide goods and service tax (GST) engagement programme in Ipoh this morning.  The Umno information chief said in the past week, he had been busy visiting several Umno divisions in Kuala Kedah, Sungai Petani, Bayan Baru, Batu Kawan, Kuching and Shah Alam to explain about 1MDB, GST and WSJ report in closed-door meetings.  Ahmad said he did not think anyone would be so stupid to keep such a large amount of public funds in their personal account.  He added that he had made a phone call to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) president and group executive director Arul Kanda Kandasamy yesterday, after reading reports of the Finance Ministry's wholly-owned investment vehicle office being raided by police and officers from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Agency (MACC).  He said he had asked Arul if any misappropriation had been carried out by 1MDB and if a single sen from 1MDB had entered the prime minister's account, both of which Arul denied.  "Sometimes, many things are just perceptions. 1MDB is actually a good firm that wants to develop the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) in Kuala Lumpur into a great financial centre," said Ahmad.  Last week, WSJ reported that US$681 million (RM2.6 billion) originating from Tanore Finance, a company in the British Virgin Islands, was deposited into Najib's accounts in two transactions on March 21 and 25 in 2013, ahead of the general election in May that year.  The business daily also uploaded documents used in its report which showed instructions for telegraphic transfers and charts showing the money trail.  A special government task force probing the allegations confirmed that Najib had accounts at AmBank, but the two accounts had been closed before the WSJ broke the story. –	[{'query': {'id': '1605093111274-7511114ac06598d0', 'domain': 'theedgemarkets.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ahmad-maslan-defends-najib-says-pm-not-stupid-take-government-money', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ahmad-maslan-defends-najib-says-pm-not-stupid-take-government-money', 'author': 'Ista Kyra', 'headline': 'Ahmad Maslan defends Najib, says PM not stupid to take government money', 'mainImage': 'https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Ahmad-Maslan_tmi.png', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': '(July 10): Datuk Ahmad Maslan has defended Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, saying the prime minister is not that stupid to take government money following The Wall Street Journal ’s (WSJ) report that US$700 million (RM2.67 billion) was transferred into his personal bank accounts.\n\nThe deputy finance minister also said Najib was not such a person to take government money and Malaysians should not trust the global business newspaper.\n\n"What kind of stupid prime minister would take RM2.46 billion in funds from a government agency into his personal account?\n\n"This is an improbability (kemusaliran) of the greatest kind.

Carel	IRIS Analytics	Organization	https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-acquires-iris-analytics-strengthening-fraud-detection-analytics-300204979.html	ARMONK, N.Y. and KOBLENZ, Germany, Jan. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has acquired IRIS Analytics, a privately held company specializing in real-time analytics to help combat payment fraud.  Only 16 percent of banks polled in a recent global IBM Institute of Business Value study could detect fraud as it is attempted. Once new schemes were identified and confirmed, it is estimated that countermeasures typically require over four weeks to deploy 1. Existing fraud detection techniques are constrained by the dependency on specialized "black box" models that are hard to understand, explain, and adapt. As the payments industry continues to evolve with faster, alternative and mobile payments innovations and the expanding use of chip & PIN, fraudsters have become more technologically sophisticated and organized, adapting their fraud techniques more quickly.  IRIS provides a real-time fraud analytics engine that leverages machine learning to generate rapid anti-fraud models while also supporting the creation and modification of ad-hoc models, proven successful on various sized payment platforms. Acting as a "virtual analyst" to help identify new fraud patterns, IRIS applies machine learning models to help analysts detect fraud and act quickly to help reduce fraudulent events. IRIS serves to bridge the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best fit analytics interactively, while testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.  "The cognitive computing approach unleashes a new paradigm in fighting fraud," said Alistair Rennie, general manager, Industry Solutions, IBM. "By integrating IRIS Analytics with IBM's counter fraud technology, we will help organizations more accurately detect fraud at scale and speed so that they are in a position to implement countermeasures quickly, with more control and transparency, while at the same time assist with dramatically lowering false positives."  IRIS is in use by leading banks and payment processors throughout the world. For example, the French payment card switch: e-rsb, opérated by STET, utilizes IRIS for 5.5 billion annual credit and debit card transactions. "With an average response time of less than five milliseconds per transaction even during peak periods when we are processing over 750 transactions per second, IRIS enables us to detect potential fraud without adding any notable overhead to our service," states Pierre Juhen, Deputy CEO of STET. "In addition, we are able to respond to newly identified fraud patterns by deploying new countermeasures in a few hours without taking down the system."  "Defenses against financial crime are in critical need of innovation and improvement. As the payments industry evolves with new payments methods such as chip and PIN, mobile payments and immediate payments, the ability for financial institutions to accurately make decisions about what is suspicious and what is legitimate before the payment is executed is required," said Constantin von Altrock, Chief Executive Officer of IRIS Analytics. "The combination of IRIS technology with IBM's Counter Fraud capabilities creates a comprehensive solution for real time payment fraud prevention."  Founded in 2007, IRIS is headquartered in Koblenz, Germany.  Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  For more information about IBM Safer Planet, please visit http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/safer-planet/  About IRIS Analytics IRIS Analytics provides technology and consultancy services to the payments industry to beat electronic payment fraud. It develops and markets the IRIS off-the-shelf fraud prevention platform which powers real-time fraud scoring across the full range of electronic payment channels, including credit, debit, prepaid, online and mobile. IRIS enables payment processors, switches, payment service providers, wallets and issuers across the world to analyse and respond to complex fraud patterns in real time, staying one step ahead of evolving, unanticipated fraud threats.

Carel	John Gannon	Individual	https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2011/07/05/how-to-check-out-your-stock-broker/?sh=2bc656974b68	There is a new reality for investors in the post financial crisis era. "Stocks for the long run" might not always be the best option, and almost all of the experts paid to help us invest wisely failed during 2007 and 2008. Many have chosen to go it alone, but others still find it necessary to hire a pro. Choosing the right financial advisor is critical, and luckily it has become much easier to check on your broker.  In the post-Madoff environment, everyone should check up on their financial advisor's background. It's one of the most basic steps that a majority of investors just don’t bother to do. A survey by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that just 15% of investors have checked an advisor’s background or credentials with a state or federal regulator.  John M. Gannon, senior vice president of investor education at FINRA says knowing that you’re doing business with a licensed financial professional is the first critical step in avoiding investment fraud. “One of the first things investors should do when considering a financial professional is to look up their licenses and make sure they’re registered. Investors who already have financial professionals should check up their broker’s registration on an annual basis,” he says.  Gannon is referring to a database on FINRA’s Web site dubbed BrokerCheck. FINRA, which is a self-regulatory organization that oversees brokerage firms and their employees, maintains the database that stores some vital information on about 1.3 million current and former FINRA-stockbrokers and 17,000 current and former FINRA-registered brokerage firms.  BrokerCheck’s files disclose information about a stockbroker’s employment history (in and out of the financial services industry), where he’s registered, licenses he holds and, perhaps most importantly, it lists any investment related investigations, disciplinary actions, arbitrations, criminal records and bankruptcies.  Those disciplinary actions or disputes, while they don’t always tell the whole story, are important when vetting a financial advisor. Don’t be hesitant to ask about prior customer disputes or arbitrations with a potential advisor.  Not every financial advisor you come across will be found on FINRA’s BrokerCheck. There are more than 275,000 so-called investment advisor representatives registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The main difference between a FINRA registered stockbroker (who carry a Series 7 license) and an SEC-registered investment advisor (Series 65) is that the later is bound by a fiduciary duty meaning the law requires them to put their clients’ interests before their own.  A Series 7 stockbroker, on the other hand, is held to a suitability standard meaning he is able to sell you investment products that are, well, suitable. In other words, a Series 7 broker could sell you a pricy mutual fund that suits your needs even though there’s a less expensive one that does the same.  It’s easy to quickly look up either type of advisors’ records. Investment advisors held to the fiduciary standard must register with the SEC (or state regulator if they manage less than $25 million in assets). Their registration can be found on the SEC’s Web site through its Investment Adviser Public Disclosure page. Investment advisors are required to disclose more information than their Series 7 counterparts, including the amount of money they manage, the number of clients they work with, the type of clients they typically work with, and types of services offered.  The appeal of an investment advisor is great on the surface. Fiduciary, fee-only conflict free advice—what’s not to love? But fee-only investment advice doesn’t necessarily mean fraud-free. Let’s put it this way, Bernard Madoff was an SEC registered investment advisor.  Also keep in mind that a financial advisor could be registered as both a Series 7 stockbroker with FINRA as well as an investment advisor with the SEC or state regulator. These folks are typically referred to as duallyregistered advisors and can play two roles: one held to a fiduciary standard and the other to the suitability standard. So one minute a dually-registered advisor could be selling you a product that’s suitable for your needs and the next he could offer you investment advice that is held to a fiduciary standard.  This is one of the fastest growing sectors within the world of financial advisors. More and more stockbrokers are getting a license to provide fiduciary investment advice. The dual licenses are a nice way for advisors to collect both commissions and offer fee-based investment advice but it’s confusing for investors.  You should check if an advisor is registered with both FINRA and the SEC. If he is then make sure you always know which hat he is wearing because in a single meeting with you he can switch hats.  While looking up a financial advisor’s registration should be one of your first steps in your search for an advisor it’s by no means the only one in the process. Here are some issues to consider on your hunt for a financial advisor:  Make sure your financial advisor can address your specific financial needs. If you’re looking for retirement planning help, you want to make sure that’s something your advisor has experience with by asking about the types of clients he typically serves, for example.  Referrals are a great way to find an advisor but make sure you’re getting them from people whose circumstances and goals are similar to yours. A 40-something single male without children might not have the same definition of a great financial advisor as a 60-something male with a family of five and whose kids are gearing up for college.  Find out how the advisor is paid. This will vary based on the kind of license(s) he has but typically investment advisors are paid on fees, and brokers are paid on commission. When dealing with a broker, ask for his firm’s commission schedule. Ask investment advisors if their fee is based on assets or time, or if it’s a flat fee. Remember, dually-licensed advisors are paid both ways so ask the advisor to give you an idea of what your total cost might look like based on your investment needs.  Ask how often the office typically communicates with its clients. Be specific. If the advisor says “once a month” then asks if those communications are face-toface meetings, phone calls or mailings.  If you need frequent attention (more than once a quarter) from your financial advisor, ask about his client to staff ratio. If he has 300 clients and a staff of 6, chances are your weekly phone calls won’t get returned right away. You shouldn’t feel bad about wanting to touch base with your financial advisor beyond the usual annual or quarterly meeting especially when the market is volatile, so ask the advisor about his frequency of contact with different clients. If everyone is getting just a quarterly meeting then chances are so will you.  A good place to start looking for an advisor is the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) Web site. NAPFA is an organization whose members are independent, fee-only advisors paid solely by the client and get no compensation based on financial products they recommend.  Most importantly, make sure you shop around for a financial advisor. FINRA’s Gannon says investors make a big mistake when they don’t comparison shop for advisors.  “We spend lots of time comparison shopping for cars, televisions and gadgets but not enough time searching for the right advisor,” he says.  What Your Broker's Designations Really Mean  Here, in alphabetical order, is a list of the 20 marks and designations you are most likely to run into during your search for financial advisors.  AEP: The Accredited Estate Planner designation requires the recipient to have five years of estate planning experience. The person must be an attorney or financial planner with appropriate credentials in that field. Given by the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils, the credential requires just two graduate level courses, but  then needs 30 hours of coursework every two years to stay in good standing.  ATA or ATP: An Accredited Tax Advisor or Accredited Tax Preparer has completed the College for Financial Planning’s Accredited Tax Preparer Program and passed an exam administered by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy on Taxation.  CAA: A Certified Annuity Advisor must be a lawyer, insurance agent or financial planner, who completes class work (either self-study or in a classroom) developed by Advisor Certification Services.  CAS: The Certified Annuity Specialist designation competes with the CAA. It requires a bachelor’s degree or one year of experience in financial services and completion of a self-study course and passing an examination administered by the Institute of Business & Finance.  CDP or CDFA: One growing sub-specialty among financial advisors is dealing with divorce cases. A Certified Divorce Planner is an experienced advisor who has completed coursework from The Institute for Certified Divorce Planners, while a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst is an experienced advisor who chose instead to  study with the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts.  CFA: Chartered Financial Analysts pass a rigorous, three-level test on investment analysis, economics, portfolio theory, accounting, corporate finance and more, administered by the CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research). CFAs also must demonstrate expertise in a specialized area of investments.  CFP: Certified Financial Planners must meet experience and education requirements and pass a 10-hour exam given by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. To remain in good standing, they must take at least 30 hours of continuing education classes every two years.  CFS: Certified Fund Specialists need only have a bachelor’s degree or one year of experience in financial services to take the self-study course and pass an examination administered by the Institute of Business & Finance.  ChFC: Chartered Financial Consultants are typically insurance agents with several years of experience, who have passed courses in financial planning from The American College. It is a credential for an insurance agent who wants to branch into other types of financial planning; many agents get this in conjunction with the CLU credential, since some of the academic requirements are the same.  CIMA: The Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA)—a trade group for advisors who specialize in high-net-worth clients and institutional investors—gives the Certified Investment Management Analyst credential to experienced consultants who complete a five-month study program at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago or the University of California–Berkeley. Candidates cannot have any history of criminal or regulatory violations, civil judicial actions or warranted customer complaints. IMCA has also started awarding the Certified Private Wealth Advisor (CPWA) credential for expertise in “the life cycle of wealth.”  CLTC: The Certified in Long-Term Care program is run by the CLTC Board of Standards and is one of the few standards that look at the vexing issue of long-term care insurance. That said, the credential has no prerequisites or required experience; it is given for the completion of a correspondence course or a two-day in-person class, plus an exam.  CLU: Chartered Life Underwriter is generally considered the highest professional designation for life insurance agents, who must meet extensive experience and education requirements, with the courses coming from The American College.  CMFC: Chartered Mutual Fund Consultants have completed a 72-hour self-study course on mutual funds. The program is administered by the College for Financial Planning and overseen by the Investment Company Institute, which is the trade association for the mutual fund industry.  CPA: Certified Public Accountants are tax specialists who must have a college degree, pass a strict national exam, and keep current on changes in tax law.  CRPC, CRC, CRFA or CRP: These are four separate-but-similar designations for advisors who want a credential that shows their ability to assist retirees and pre-retirees. Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor, given by the College for Financial Planning, seems to be most popular, but not significantly different from a Certified Retirement Counselor (bestowed by the International Foundation for Retirement Education), a Certified Retirement Financial Advisor (given by the Society of Certified Retirement Financial Advisors), or a Certified Retirement Planner (from Retirement Planners LLC). There is also a PRPS—Personal Retirement Planning Specialist— credential, given mostly to insurance professionals looking to broaden their expertise, especially as it comes to selling annuity/lifetime income products.  CSA, CSC or CSFP: Certified Senior Advisors have taken classes on working with senior citizens that go beyond the finances to help them understand the health, insurance, and other issues that could come into play. The same applies to the Certified Senior Consultant and Chartered Senior Financial Planner credentials.  CWM: Chartered Wealth Managers have at least three years’ experience and typically have an advanced degree. They complete coursework with the American Academy of Financial Management. A similar, competing credential is the CWC, or Certified Wealth Consultant, run by The Heritage Institute.  EA: Enrolled Agents are tax preparers who either worked for the IRS for at least five years or passed a test on federal tax law.  JD: The Juris Doctor is a law degree, not an actual financial-planning credential. That said, there are plenty of lawyers who wind up in financial planning and services, whether that is through estate planning, tax law or getting an additional financial-planning credential. When that happens, you can expect that the JD mark will be prominent among their credentials.  PFS: Personal Financial Specialists are CPAs who have met education and experience requirements and passed a comprehensive exam on financial planning. Because this credential is always linked to the CPA—designees typically list it as CPA/PFS—the person who has it is typically qualified to help a client with both investment and tax issues. That said, many PFS advisors no longer do tax work and focus more on tax-efficient financial planning.  RIA: Not really a credential at all; when someone tells you he’s a “registered investment advisor,” it simply means that he has registered with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission and has paid a registration fee.		random	advice on how to choose a financial advisor	sebastien		How To Check Out Your Stock Broker
Shakshi	Ali Khamenei	Individual	https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ali-Khamenei	Second leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran  As Khomeini’s health declined and it remained unclear who would be both qualified to succeed him and sympathetic to his vision of velāyat-e faqīh, in 1989 he appointed a council to revise the constitution. Its work had not been completed by the time of his death in June, and it appointed Khamenei as the next rahbar, or leader. However, Khamenei did not meet the qualifications: he was not yet a senior cleric, having been accorded only the somewhat less lofty title of hojatoleslām. Moreover, he favoured a strongly centralized government under the leader, in part to forestall the influence of foreign powers in domestic politics. Changes to the constitution, approved in a referendum in July, loosened the qualifications, eliminated the post of prime minister and strengthened the presidency, and gave the leader significant power to oversee and intervene in political affairs.  In the early 1990s Khamenei enjoyed a good working relationship with Pres. Hashemi Rafsanjani, another revolutionary figure with whom he was close. His relations with reformist president Mohammad Khatami, however, who served from 1997 to 2005, were strained. Against Khamenei’s conservatism and deep distrust of the United States, Khatami had a liberalizing agenda and favoured rapprochement with the United States.  Presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  Although Khamenei projected an official neutrality, subtle support for the candidacy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad —a conservative former mayor of Tehrān and a relative unknown—was detectable in some of Khamenei’s speeches prior to Ahmadinejad’s victory in the 2005 presidential elections. Many found Ahmadinejad’s success surprising, and it was clear that he would not have been elected without Khamenei’s support. During his first term in office, Ahmadinejad endeared himself to Khamenei through his bellicose stance toward opponents both at home and abroad, particularly by flaunting the nation’s nuclear program. Nonetheless, the two at times found themselves at odds, particularly as they engaged in a power struggle in Ahmadinejad’s second term.  Khamenei’s leadership saw its strongest challenge during the presidential election of 2009, when Ahmadinejad faced a surprisingly formidable opponent in Mousavi —Khamenei’s former prime minister (1981–89), around whom the country’s reformist contingent had coalesced. Although preelection polls had shown a tight contest, Ahmadinejad was declared the victor with more than 60 percent of the vote, and the result was quickly endorsed by Khamenei. Suspecting fraud, the opposition rejected the result and gathered to protest, staging massive popular demonstrations in Tehrān and elsewhere. In some instances, protesters shouted slogans calling for Khamenei’s downfall. In the media the protests were dubbed the Green Movement, after the colour associated with Mousavi’s campaign. Although the first protests were largely peaceful, police and paramilitary groups were deployed to suppress them; a handful of protesters and members of the opposition were killed, and many more were arrested. Following nearly a week of protests, Khamenei issued his first public response to the unrest, again supporting Ahmadinejad’s victory and warning the opposition against further demonstrations. Despite the government’s attempts at suppression, protests continued for the rest of the year.  Relations between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad soured during the latter’s second term as president. It was believed that Ahmadinejad was trying to wrest power from the clerical establishment. Tensions came into public view in April 2011 when Ahmadinejad refused to report to cabinet meetings or his presidential office for 11 days after Khamenei vetoed his dismissal of the minister of intelligence. He returned to work under the threat of impeachment. Ahmadinejad took another provocative step in May, when he named himself acting minister of oil before the clerical establishment could intervene. In March 2012 Ahmadinejad was summoned by the Majles for an unprecedented session of questioning over his policies and his power struggles with Khamenei. Ahmadinejad finished his term in 2013 but was barred from running again in 2017.  Presidency of Hassan Rouhani  Under Ahmadinejad’s successor, the centrist cleric Hassan Rouhani, Iran changed direction in foreign affairs, moving rapidly toward reducing friction with the West. International negotiations toward an agreement to end Iran’s nuclear research programs in exchange for the lifting of sanctions began within several months of Rouhani’s election in 2013. Throughout the negotiation process, Khamenei maintained a skeptical public posture, voicing objections about aspects of the agreement that he saw as possible infringements on Iran’s sovereignty. Nevertheless, a final agreement was reached in 2015 with Khamenei’s approval.  Rouhani won reelection in 2017 in a landslide, but the benefits of lifted sanctions and resolution of the nuclear issue were short-lived. After many Iranians failed to see much relief in their everyday lives, demonstrations broke out in December 2017. They took aim not only at Rouhani but at Khamenei as well. The situation worsened in May 2018 when U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from the nuclear agreement and would reimpose sanctions; despite Iranian compliance with the deal, Trump argued that the deal did not do enough to constrain Iran. In August, as the first set of sanctions went into force, Khamenei rebuked Rouhani for having conceded too much in the arrangements of the 2015 agreement. Nonetheless, he dismissed calls for Rouhani to step down. Rouhani’s policy of rapprochement now appeared to be over, and Iran returned to the virulent display of military development that Khamenei had long favoured. This display was condemned by other signatories of the nuclear deal, who had pledged active support to maintain the deal despite U.S. withdrawal.  In 2019, as the renewed sanctions continued to bite and it was becoming apparent that the other signatories were unable to guarantee Iran the benefits of the deal, Khamenei sought a more aggressive government stance in facing the crisis.

Its work had not been completed by the time of his death in June, and it appointed Khamenei as the next rahbar, or leader. However, Khamenei did not meet the qualifications: he was not yet a senior cleric, having been accorded only the somewhat less lofty title of hojatoleslām. Moreover, he favoured a strongly centralized government under the leader, in part to forestall the influence of foreign powers in domestic politics. Changes to the constitution, approved in a referendum in July, loosened the qualifications, eliminated the post of prime minister and strengthened the presidency, and gave the leader significant power to oversee and intervene in political affairs.\n\nIn the early 1990s Khamenei enjoyed a good working relationship with Pres. Hashemi Rafsanjani, another revolutionary figure with whom he was close. His relations with reformist president Mohammad Khatami, however, who served from 1997 to 2005, were strained. Against Khamenei’s conservatism and deep distrust of the United States, Khatami had a liberalizing agenda and favoured rapprochement with the United States.\n\nPresidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n\nAlthough Khamenei projected an official neutrality, subtle support for the candidacy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad —a conservative former mayor of Tehrān and a relative unknown—was detectable in some of Khamenei’s speeches prior to Ahmadinejad’s victory in the 2005 presidential elections. Many found Ahmadinejad’s success surprising, and it was clear that he would not have been elected without Khamenei’s support. During his first term in office, Ahmadinejad endeared himself to Khamenei through his bellicose stance toward opponents both at home and abroad, particularly by flaunting the nation’s nuclear program. Nonetheless, the two at times found themselves at odds, particularly as they engaged in a power struggle in Ahmadinejad’s second term.\n\nKhamenei’s leadership saw its strongest challenge during the presidential election of 2009, when Ahmadinejad faced a surprisingly formidable opponent in Mousavi —Khamenei’s former prime minister (1981–89), around whom the country’s reformist contingent had coalesced. Although preelection polls had shown a tight contest, Ahmadinejad was declared the victor with more than 60 percent of the vote, and the result was quickly endorsed by Khamenei. Suspecting fraud, the opposition rejected the result and gathered to protest, staging massive popular demonstrations in Tehrān and elsewhere. In some instances, protesters shouted slogans calling for Khamenei’s downfall. In the media the protests were dubbed the Green Movement, after the colour associated with Mousavi’s campaign. Although the first protests were largely peaceful, police and paramilitary groups were deployed to suppress them; a handful of protesters and members of the opposition were killed, and many more were arrested. Following nearly a week of protests, Khamenei issued his first public response to the unrest, again supporting Ahmadinejad’s victory and warning the opposition against further demonstrations. Despite the government’s attempts at suppression, protests continued for the rest of the year.\n\nRelations between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad soured during the latter’s second term as president. It was believed that Ahmadinejad was trying to wrest power from the clerical establishment. Tensions came into public view in April 2011 when Ahmadinejad refused to report to cabinet meetings or his presidential office for 11 days after Khamenei vetoed his dismissal of the minister of intelligence. He returned to work under the threat of impeachment. Ahmadinejad took another provocative step in May, when he named himself acting minister of oil before the clerical establishment could intervene. In March 2012 Ahmadinejad was summoned by the Majles for an unprecedented session of questioning over his policies and his power struggles with Khamenei. Ahmadinejad finished his term in 2013 but was barred from running again in 2017.\n\nPresidency of Hassan Rouhani\n\nUnder Ahmadinejad’s successor, the centrist cleric Hassan Rouhani, Iran changed direction in foreign affairs, moving rapidly toward reducing friction with the West. International negotiations toward an agreement to end Iran’s nuclear research programs in exchange for the lifting of sanctions began within several months of Rouhani’s election in 2013. Throughout the negotiation process, Khamenei maintained a skeptical public posture, voicing objections about aspects of the agreement that he saw as possible infringements on Iran’s sovereignty. Nevertheless, a final agreement was reached in 2015 with Khamenei’s approval.\n\nRouhani won reelection in 2017 in a landslide, but the benefits of lifted sanctions and resolution of the nuclear issue were short-lived. After many Iranians failed to see much relief in their everyday lives, demonstrations broke out in December 2017. They took aim not only at Rouhani but at Khamenei as well. The situation worsened in May 2018 when U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from the nuclear agreement and would reimpose sanctions; despite Iranian compliance with the deal, Trump argued that the deal did not do enough to constrain Iran. In August, as the first set of sanctions went into force, Khamenei rebuked Rouhani for having conceded too much in the arrangements of the 2015 agreement. Nonetheless, he dismissed calls for Rouhani to step down. Rouhani’s policy of rapprochement now appeared to be over, and Iran returned to the virulent display of military development that Khamenei had long favoured. This display was condemned by other signatories of the nuclear deal, who had pledged active support to maintain the deal despite U.S. withdrawal.\n\nIn 2019, as the renewed sanctions continued to bite and it was becoming apparent that the other signatories were unable to guarantee Iran the benefits of the deal, Khamenei sought a more aggressive government stance in facing the crisis. He categorically rejected renegotiating the agreement with the U.S., backed a gradual breach of the deal, and engaged in hawkish rhetoric.

Carel	Frank Abagnale	Individual	https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Choosing-the-best-web-fraud-detection-system-for-your-company	Each U.S. consumer has, on average, at least one credit card and two bank cards they use to make in-person and online purchases, pay bills and send money to others. Collectively, U.S. consumers make billions of noncash transactions every year; these are prime targets of cybercriminals looking to walk away with as much of that money as they can.  Although the rate of cybercrime and attempted fraud increases each year, the portion of lost e-commerce revenue by North American merchants is just under 1%, according to the 2014 CyberSource Online Fraud Report, a number that's remained fairly static since 2010. Experts point to the efficient management of web fraud as the key reason. Even so, payment fraud is a great concern to consumers, and merchants and financial institutions take the hit for most of the money lost as a result of fraud in the form of refunds and chargebacks.  Web fraud detection explained  Organizations that accept payment cards over the web -- also referred to as card not present (CNP) transactions -- or organizations that back those payments, will deploy web fraud detection software or services to detect and help prevent fraud.  Web fraud detection systems typically focus on new account origination, account takeover and payment fraud. With account takeover and new account origination fraud detection, organizations attempt to root out unauthorized or fraudulent users posing as legitimate users. Payment fraud detection involves determining whether purchases are being or have been made with stolen payment cards. Some vendors also offer fraud intelligence services, authentication, malware detection (such as man-in-the-browser infections on computers and mobile devices) and secure clients, as well as managed services in which the vendor is primarily responsible for monitoring and taking action on instances of fraud.  Web fraud detection system vendors generally provide either an on-premises software product or platform, or a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that scans financial transactions made via the web or with mobile devices.  How web fraud detection works  Web fraud detection software (or a cloud-based service) runs background processes that scan transactions and score them based on the possibility of fraud. Many different data points are considered to determine the score, such as user behavior, device ID, other device characteristics, geolocation, order links and so on. The data is then compared against "normal" attributes. If the transaction is deemed valid, it's allowed and processed. If the transaction falls outside of an accepted range, an alert is issued and the transaction may be automatically suspended or denied.  To detect fraud, vendors typically use either a predictive behavioral scoring model, in which an account holder's behavior is the predominant criteria, or a rule-based system that uses pattern recognition. Some products or services use both types of scoring models.  Even with automated systems available, organizations still need to manually analyze certain transactions, such as those that an automated tool flags as fraudulent.  Who needs web fraud detection services? Organizations of all sizes -- from SMBs to enterprises -- that deal with any volume of CNP transactions that are too burdensome or time-intensive to review manually should have some type of fraud detection in place. Specific customers include banking and financial services institutions, e-commerce merchants, human resources and payroll services, and social networking sites, just to name a few. Web fraud detection services especially help organizations that need to meet Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements.  How is web fraud detection sold? SaaS offerings are the most straight-forward approach to web fraud detection. A customer simply signs up for a service and agrees to pay a monthly fee based on the number of anticipated transactions (or a similar metric). The customer can scale the fraud detection service up or down as its needs change.  On-premises software requires an upfront cost for the software and any hardware or infrastructure upgrades required to support the software. Companies that lack a full-time security support team (most often small to midsize companies) may need to pay the vendor for initial setup just to get the software up and running properly, plus minimal staff training.  Managing and supporting web fraud detection  Web fraud detection management and support varies depending on how it's implemented.  SaaS-based web fraud detection is hosted by a service provider; customers access the service through a configuration interface to customize settings and perform typical administrative tasks.  On-premises web fraud detection systems require more administrative effort for installation and maintenance of the server on which the software runs, for the software itself, and for the customer's network infrastructure.  Web fraud detection systems and services can't detect every instance of fraud, but they greatly reduce a merchant's or financial institution's risk and provide a high level of protection to consumers.  Features  Frank Abagnale, a former imposter and fraudster who wrote the book Catch Me If You Can believes "punishment for fraud and the recovery of stolen funds [is] so rare, prevention is the only viable course of action." An organization that conducts business over the web should interpret that statement to include detection as well. That is, prevention of web fraud is a combination of accurate fraud detection along with layers of security that help to protect users, devices and networks.  Web fraud detection, sometimes referred to as online fraud detection, is a set of services or a software product that detects fraudulent transactions or activities conducted over the web. A typical web fraud detection system detects new account origination (identity fraud), account takeover (stolen user credentials) and payment fraud (e.g., with a stolen credit card), but can offer much more. How a web fraud detection system accomplishes detection and to what extent is what sets one tool apart from the others. So it's important to understand key features available in a fraud detection tool in order to evaluate these products and choose the best for your company.  Sector focus: Some web fraud detection vendors focus specifically on the banking/financial services industry or e-commerce, whereas others offer products that claim to tackle nearly any type of sector that maintains online accounts and conducts transactions.  A financial services company may best be served by a web fraud detection system created specifically for that industry. The same applies to e-commerce and retailers. Government agencies offering e-government services, social networking sites, insurance companies and so forth can broaden their research to look at sector-neutral products (those that support many different verticals), which represent the lion's share of available products.  Multiple layers: In both its Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection (revised on July 21, 2015) and in previous publications, Gartner highly recommends using multiple fraud-prevention layers designed to help prevent or stop further damage from internet-based malware attacks. The most significant layers involve endpoints (Layer 1), navigation (Layer 2) and users or entities (Layer 3).  According to Gartner's layering scheme, an endpoint product analyzes computer, mobile device or telephony device characteristics, such as recent login data, and provides validation of a user's account privileges. A navigation system analyzes session navigation for anomalies. A user- or entity-centric product compares transactions to the "norm" for that user or entity, for a specific channel such as e-commerce.  Many web fraud detection systems provide protection for all three layers; others focus on only one layer. It's possible to get complete coverage from various products, but it makes sense to look for a product that provides protection at all three layers.  Analytics and continuous profiling: Rule-based analytics rely on pattern recognition, which is based on what is already known. Predictive behavioral analytics look at an account holder's behavior and seek anomalies based on expected behavior. Models produce risk scores, which are evaluated against user or entity profiles created from the results of analytics.  Products that get high marks in this category are those that provide continuous profiling of accounts and users to detect fraud, using one or both analytical models, though behavioral analytics is somewhat preferable over rule-based.  Integration of external intelligence: One part of the security industry that's gained significant traction in recent years is threat intelligence. A threat intelligence service gathers raw data about emerging threats from several sources (and perhaps millions of endpoints), and then analyzes and filters that data to produce useable information.  Security control systems, such as security information and event management and next-gen firewalls, use threat intelligence to better protect an organization from emerging or zero-day threats. An identity intelligence service, or identify proofing service, provides an analysis of user identity and access characteristics (user roles, policy violations, biometric data and so on), gathered from public and proprietary data sources. Identity intelligence is often used to verify a person's identity before an organization approves an account and issues credentials.  For the most comprehensive coverage, organizations should give preference to web fraud detection systems that can integrate external threat intelligence and/or identity intelligence. In fact, the majority of products are expected to provide this feature by 2017.  Compliance: Ensure your organizations choice of web fraud detection system meets the requirements of all necessary compliance regulations. For example, if an organization accepts payment cards, it should ask if the product under consideration carry PCI DSS-certification.  Many organizations need to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or FACTA Red-Flags, or require SSAE 16 or ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management. Keep a list of the organization's compliance requirements handy when vetting web fraud detection systems and ask each vendor on the short list to provide documentation that indicates the product's compliance support.  Other considerations: Web fraud detection vendors typically provide downloadable data sheets, brochures and similar product assets on their websites to prospective customers. Be sure to check the copyright dates on the available assets, especially the data sheets, and consider dropping from consideration any products with asset dates older than a year or two. Web fraud detection systems must adapt to a constant influx of new threats, and incorporate innovation to remain relevant and competitive. Old assets may be an indicator of a product that's not technologically fresh and effective.  As organizations research vendors and products, they'll read about how the web fraud detection industry has undergone a lot of churn since 2013, mainly from mergers and acquisitions. When a vendor is acquired to fill in a technology gap in a portfolio, innovation can suffer. When talking to each vendor sales rep, be sure to ask the following:  The bottom line  Evaluating web fraud detection systems requires more than a search through data sheets and marketing materials, all of which can be misleading and out of date. Take advantage of one-on-one demos offered by the vendors, during which you can ask the sales reps specific product questions in relation to your organization's industry/channel and transaction volume. That's the best time to establish realistic pricing as well, because most web fraud detection systems are based on volume.

Collectively, U.S. consumers make billions of noncash transactions every year; these are prime targets of cybercriminals looking to walk away with as much of that money as they can.\n\nAlthough the rate of cybercrime and attempted fraud increases each year, the portion of lost e-commerce revenue by North American merchants is just under 1%, according to the 2014 CyberSource Online Fraud Report, a number that\'s remained fairly static since 2010. Experts point to the efficient management of web fraud as the key reason. Even so, payment fraud is a great concern to consumers, and merchants and financial institutions take the hit for most of the money lost as a result of fraud in the form of refunds and chargebacks.\n\nWeb fraud detection explained\n\nOrganizations that accept payment cards over the web -- also referred to as card not present (CNP) transactions -- or organizations that back those payments, will deploy web fraud detection software or services to detect and help prevent fraud.\n\nWeb fraud detection systems typically focus on new account origination, account takeover and payment fraud. With account takeover and new account origination fraud detection, organizations attempt to root out unauthorized or fraudulent users posing as legitimate users. Payment fraud detection involves determining whether purchases are being or have been made with stolen payment cards. Some vendors also offer fraud intelligence services, authentication, malware detection (such as man-in-the-browser infections on computers and mobile devices) and secure clients, as well as managed services in which the vendor is primarily responsible for monitoring and taking action on instances of fraud.\n\nWeb fraud detection system vendors generally provide either an on-premises software product or platform, or a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that scans financial transactions made via the web or with mobile devices.\n\nHow web fraud detection works\n\nWeb fraud detection software (or a cloud-based service) runs background processes that scan transactions and score them based on the possibility of fraud. Many different data points are considered to determine the score, such as user behavior, device ID, other device characteristics, geolocation, order links and so on. The data is then compared against "normal" attributes. If the transaction is deemed valid, it\'s allowed and processed. If the transaction falls outside of an accepted range, an alert is issued and the transaction may be automatically suspended or denied.\n\nTo detect fraud, vendors typically use either a predictive behavioral scoring model, in which an account holder\'s behavior is the predominant criteria, or a rule-based system that uses pattern recognition. Some products or services use both types of scoring models.\n\nEven with automated systems available, organizations still need to manually analyze certain transactions, such as those that an automated tool flags as fraudulent.\n\nWho needs web fraud detection services? Organizations of all sizes -- from SMBs to enterprises -- that deal with any volume of CNP transactions that are too burdensome or time-intensive to review manually should have some type of fraud detection in place. Specific customers include banking and financial services institutions, e-commerce merchants, human resources and payroll services, and social networking sites, just to name a few. Web fraud detection services especially help organizations that need to meet Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements.\n\nHow is web fraud detection sold? SaaS offerings are the most straight-forward approach to web fraud detection. A customer simply signs up for a service and agrees to pay a monthly fee based on the number of anticipated transactions (or a similar metric). The customer can scale the fraud detection service up or down as its needs change.\n\nOn-premises software requires an upfront cost for the software and any hardware or infrastructure upgrades required to support the software. Companies that lack a full-time security support team (most often small to midsize companies) may need to pay the vendor for initial setup just to get the software up and running properly, plus minimal staff training.\n\nManaging and supporting web fraud detection\n\nWeb fraud detection management and support varies depending on how it\'s implemented.\n\nSaaS-based web fraud detection is hosted by a service provider; customers access the service through a configuration interface to customize settings and perform typical administrative tasks.\n\nOn-premises web fraud detection systems require more administrative effort for installation and maintenance of the server on which the software runs, for the software itself, and for the customer\'s network infrastructure.\n\nWeb fraud detection systems and services can\'t detect every instance of fraud, but they greatly reduce a merchant\'s or financial institution\'s risk and provide a high level of protection to consumers.\n\nFeatures\n\nFrank Abagnale, a former imposter and fraudster who wrote the book Catch Me If You Can believes "punishment for fraud and the recovery of stolen funds [is] so rare, prevention is the only viable course of action." An organization that conducts business over the web should interpret that statement to include detection as well. That is, prevention of web fraud is a combination of accurate fraud detection along with layers of security that help to protect users, devices and networks.\n\nWeb fraud detection, sometimes referred to as online fraud detection, is a set of services or a software product that detects fraudulent transactions or activities conducted over the web.

Some vendors also offer fraud <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/An-introduction-to-threat-intelligence-services-in-the-enterprise">intelligence</a> services, authentication, <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Fundamentals-of-endpoint-security-Antimalware-protection-in-the-enterprise">malware detection</a> (such as man-in-the-browser infections on computers and mobile devices) and secure clients, as well as managed services in which the vendor is primarily responsible for monitoring and taking action on instances of fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Web fraud detection system vendors generally provide either an on-premises software product or platform, or a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that scans financial transactions made via the web or with mobile devices.</p>\n\n<h2>How\xa0web\xa0fraud detection works</h2>\n\n<p>Web fraud detection software (or a cloud-based service) runs background processes that scan transactions and score them based on the possibility of fraud. Many different data points are considered to determine the score, such as user behavior, device ID, other device characteristics, geolocation, order links and so on. The data is then compared against "normal" attributes. If the transaction is deemed valid, it\'s allowed and processed. If the transaction falls outside of an accepted range, an alert is issued and the transaction may be automatically suspended or denied.</p>\n\n<p>To detect fraud, vendors typically use either a predictive behavioral scoring model, in which an account holder\'s behavior is the predominant criteria, or a rule-based system that uses pattern recognition. Some products or services use both types of scoring models.</p>\n\n<p>Even with automated systems available, organizations still need to manually analyze certain transactions, such as those that an automated tool flags as fraudulent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who needs web fraud detection services? </strong>Organizations of all sizes -- from <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/SMB-small-and-medium-sized-business-or-small-and-midsized-business">SMBs</a> to enterprises -- that deal with any volume of CNP transactions that are too burdensome or time-intensive to review manually should have some type of fraud detection in place. Specific customers include banking and financial services institutions, e-commerce merchants, human resources and payroll services, and social networking sites, just to name a few. Web fraud detection services especially help organizations that need to meet Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is web fraud detection sold?</strong> SaaS offerings are the most straight-forward approach to web fraud detection. A customer simply signs up for a service and agrees to pay a monthly fee based on the number of anticipated transactions (or a similar metric). The customer can scale the fraud detection service up or down as its needs change.</p>\n\n<p>On-premises software requires an upfront cost for the software and any hardware or infrastructure upgrades required to support the software. Companies that lack a full-time security support team (most often small to midsize companies) may need to pay the vendor for initial setup just to get the software up and running properly, plus minimal staff training.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing and supporting web fraud detection</h2>\n\n<p>Web fraud detection management and support varies depending on how it\'s implemented.</p>\n\n<p>SaaS-based web fraud detection is hosted by a service provider; customers access the service through a configuration interface to customize settings and perform typical administrative tasks.</p>\n\n<p>On-premises web fraud detection systems require more administrative effort for installation and maintenance of the server on which the software runs, for the software itself, and for the customer\'s network infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Web fraud detection systems and services can\'t detect every instance of fraud, but they greatly reduce a merchant\'s or financial institution\'s risk and provide a high level of protection to consumers.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<p>Frank Abagnale, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJIc16aqpO8">former imposter and fraudster</a> who wrote the book <em>Catch Me If You Can</em> believes "punishment for fraud and the recovery of stolen funds [is] so rare, prevention is the only viable course of action." An organization that conducts business over the web should interpret that statement to include <em>detection</em> as well. That is, prevention of web fraud is a combination of accurate fraud detection along with layers of security that help to protect users, devices and networks.</p>\n\n<p>Web fraud detection, sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cyber-crime-what-every-business-needs-to-know"><em>online fraud</em></a><em> detection</em>, is a set of services or a software product that detects fraudulent transactions or activities conducted over the web. A typical web fraud detection system detects new account origination (identity fraud), account takeover (stolen user credentials) and payment fraud (e.g., with a stolen credit card), but can offer much more. How a web fraud detection system accomplishes detection and to what extent is what sets one tool apart from the others. So it\'s important to understand key features available in a fraud detection tool in order to evaluate these products and choose the best for your company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sector focus: </strong>Some web fraud detection vendors focus specifically on the <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/Transaction-analytics-tools-can-rescue-companies-from-fraud">banking/financial services</a> industry or e-commerce, whereas others offer products that claim to tackle nearly any type of sector that maintains online accounts and conducts transactions.</p>\n\n<p>A financial services company may best be served by a web fraud detection system created specifically for that industry. The same applies to e-commerce and retailers. Government agencies offering e-government services, social networking sites, insurance companies and so forth can broaden their research to look at sector-neutral products (those that support many different verticals), which represent the lion\'s share of available products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple layers: </strong>In both its <em>Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection</em> (revised on July 21, 2015) and in previous publications, Gartner highly recommends using multiple fraud-prevention layers designed to help prevent or stop further damage from internet-based malware attacks. The most significant layers involve endpoints (Layer 1), navigation (Layer 2) and users or entities (Layer 3).</p>\n\n<p>According to Gartner\'s layering scheme, an endpoint product analyzes computer, mobile device or telephony device characteristics, such as recent login data, and provides validation of a user\'s account privileges. A navigation system analyzes session navigation for anomalies. A user- or entity-centric product compares transactions to the "norm" for that user or entity, for a specific channel such as e-commerce.</p>\n\n<p>Many web fraud detection systems provide protection for all three layers; others focus on only one layer. It\'s possible to get complete coverage from various products, but it makes sense to look for a product that provides protection at all three layers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Analytics and continuous profiling: </strong>Rule-based analytics rely on pattern recognition, which is based on what is already known. <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/predictive-analytics">Predictive behavioral analytics</a> look at an account holder\'s behavior and seek anomalies based on expected behavior. Models produce risk scores, which are evaluated against user or entity profiles created from the results of analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Products that get high marks in this category are those that provide continuous profiling of accounts and users to detect fraud, using one or both analytical models, though behavioral analytics is somewhat preferable over rule-based.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Integration of external intelligence: </strong>One part of the security industry that\'s gained significant traction in recent years is threat intelligence. A <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/An-introduction-to-threat-intelligence-services-in-the-enterprise">threat intelligence service</a> gathers raw data about emerging threats from several sources (and perhaps millions of endpoints), and then analyzes and filters that data to produce useable information.</p>\n\n<p>Security control systems, such as <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Introduction-to-SIEM-services-and-products">security information and event management</a> and <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Introduction-to-next-generation-firewalls-in-the-enterprise">next-gen firewalls</a>, use threat intelligence to better protect an organization from emerging or zero-day threats. An identity intelligence service, or identify proofing service, provides an analysis of user identity and access characteristics (user roles, policy violations, biometric data and so on), gathered from public and proprietary data sources. Identity intelligence is often used to verify a person\'s identity before an organization approves an account and issues credentials.</p>\n\n<p>For the most comprehensive coverage, organizations should give preference to web fraud detection systems that can integrate external threat intelligence and/or identity intelligence. In fact, the majority of products are expected to provide this feature by 2017.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compliance</strong>: Ensure your organizations choice of web fraud detection system meets the requirements of all necessary compliance regulations. For example, if an organization accepts payment cards, it should ask if the product under consideration carry PCI DSS-certification.</p>\n\n<p>Many organizations need to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or <a href="https://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/Red-Flags-Rule-RFR">FACTA Red-Flags</a>, or require <a href="https://searchcloudsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/SSAE-16">SSAE 16</a> or <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.co.uk/definition/ISO-27001">ISO/IEC 27001</a> for information security management. Keep a list of the organization\'s compliance requirements handy when vetting web fraud detection systems and ask each vendor on the short list to provide documentation that indicates the product\'s compliance support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other considerations: </strong>Web fraud detection vendors typically provide downloadable data sheets, brochures and similar product assets on their websites to prospective customers. Be sure to check the copyright dates on the available assets, especially the data sheets, and consider dropping from consideration any products with asset dates older than a year or two. Web fraud detection systems must adapt to a constant influx of new threats, and incorporate innovation to remain relevant and competitive. Old assets may be an indicator of a product that\'s not technologically fresh and effective.</p>\n\n<p>As organizations research vendors and products, they\'ll read about how the web fraud detection industry has undergone a lot of churn since 2013, mainly from mergers and acquisitions. When a vendor is acquired to fill in a technology gap in a portfolio, innovation can suffer. When talking to each vendor sales rep, be sure to ask the following:</p>\n\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n\n<p>Evaluating web fraud detection systems requires more than a search through data sheets and marketing materials, all of which can be misleading and out of date. Take advantage of one-on-one demos offered by the vendors, during which you can ask the sales reps specific product questions in relation to your organization\'s industry/channel and transaction volume. That\'s the best time to establish realistic pricing as well, because most web fraud detection systems are based on volume.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong><br><em>Ed Tittel is a 30-plus year IT veteran who\'s worked as a developer, networking consultant, technical trainer, writer and expert witness.

Shakshi	Benjamin Netanyahu	Individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697	Published  image copyrightEPA  In more than 14 years as prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has become both Israel's longest-serving leader and the first to face criminal prosecution while in office.  Lauded by his supporters as "King Bibi" and as a "magician" for his knack of winning elections, the leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party is fighting for his political survival as he prepares to stand trial on corruption charges.  His success in polls has owed much to his image as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.  He has taken a hard line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any discussion of peace, and long warned of danger from Iran.  Brother's legacy  Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949. In 1963 his family moved to the US when his father Benzion, a prominent historian and Zionist activist, was offered an academic post.  At the age of 18, Benjamin returned to Israel, where he spent five distinguished years in the army, serving as a captain in an elite commando unit, the Sayeret Matkal. He took part in a raid on Beirut's airport in 1968 and fought in the 1973 Middle East war.  After his military service, Mr Netanyahu went back to the US, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  image copyrightGPO via Getty Images  In 1976, Mr Netanyahu's brother, Jonathan, was killed leading a raid to rescue hostages from a hijacked airliner in Entebbe, Uganda. His death had a profound impact on the Netanyahu family, and his name became legendary in Israel.  Mr Netanyahu set up an anti-terrorism institute in his brother's memory and in 1982 became Israel's deputy chief of mission in Washington.  Overnight, Mr Netanyahu's public life was launched. An articulate English speaker with a distinctive American accent, he became a familiar face on US television and an effective advocate for Israel.  Mr Netanyahu was appointed Israel's permanent representative at the UN in New York in 1984.  Rise to power  Only in 1988, when he returned to Israel, did he become involved in domestic politics, winning a seat for the Likud party in the Knesset (parliament) and becoming deputy foreign minister.  He later became party chairman, and in 1996, Israel's first directly elected prime minister after an early election following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.  image copyrightGetty Images  Mr Netanyahu was also Israel's youngest leader and the first to be born after the state was founded in 1948.  Despite having fiercely criticised the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, Mr Netanyahu signed a deal handing over 80% of Hebron to Palestinian Authority control and agreed to further withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.  He lost office in 1999 after he called elections 17 months early, defeated by Labour leader Ehud Barak, Mr Netanyahu's former commander.  Political revival  Mr Netanyahu stepped down and was succeeded as Likud leader by Ariel Sharon.  After Mr Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001, Mr Netanyahu returned to government, first as foreign minister and then as finance minister. In 2005, he resigned in protest at the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip.  His chance came again in 2005, when Mr Sharon - just before a massive stroke that left him in a coma - split from Likud and set up a new centrist party, Kadima.  Life and times  1949 - born in Tel Aviv 1967-73 - serves as soldier commando captain 1984 - becomes ambassador to UN 1988 - enters Knesset and government 1996 - becomes prime minister 1999 - loses election 2002-03 - serves as foreign minister 2003-05 - serves as finance minister; resigns over withdrawal from Gaza Dec 2005 - wins back leadership of Likud party 2009 - returns as prime minister 2013 - re-elected as prime minister 2015 - wins fourth term 2019 - charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust 2020 - begins fifth term  Mr Netanyahu won the Likud leadership again and was elected prime minister for the second time in March 2009.  He agreed an unprecedented 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, enabling peace talks with Palestinians, but negotiations collapsed in late-2010.  Although in 2009 he publicly announced his conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he later toughened his position. "A Palestinian state will not be created, not like the one people are talking about. It won't happen," he told an Israeli radio station in 2019.  Conflict in Gaza  Despite his tough rhetoric and fulsome support for Israeli military action, Mr Netanyahu has not managed to put a stop to attacks from Palestinian militants under Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  In late 2012, he ordered a major offensive after an escalation of rocket fire into Israel, but stopped short of sending in ground troops.  However, after a relative lull, cross-border violence flared again and after a surge of rocket attacks in July 2014, Mr Netanyahu ordered another military campaign.  image copyrightAFP  The 50-day war left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead, most of them civilians, according to UN and Palestinian officials. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.  Although during the conflict Israel had the support of the United States, its closest ally, relations between Mr Netanyahu and President Barack Obama were difficult.  They reached a low point when Mr Netanyahu addressed Congress in March 2015, warning against a "bad deal" arising out of US negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme. The Obama administration condemned the visit as interfering and damaging.  Trump ties  The advent of Donald Trump's presidency in 2017 led to a closer alignment between US and Israeli government policies, and within a year Mr Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  The move sparked fury across the Arab world - which supports the Palestinians' claim to the eastern half of Jerusalem occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war - but it handed Mr Netanyahu a major political and diplomatic coup.  image copyrightAFP  Just over a year later, Mr Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, further reversing decades of US policy and earning Mr Netanyahu's praise.  And in January, Mr Netanyahu was in Washington for the launch of Mr Trump's "vision for peace" between Israel and the Palestinians.  The prime minister hailed it as the "opportunity of the century" and vowed to move swiftly to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley that were allocated to Israel under Mr Trump's proposals. The Palestinians rejected the plan, calling it "the slap of the century".  Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump also see eye-to-eye on Iran. The prime minister has repeatedly warned of the danger to the international community of leaving it with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. In 2018, he welcomed Mr Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and Washington's strengthening of economic sanctions against it.  Shadow of charges  In the past few years, Mr Netanyahu has been dogged by a long corruption investigation, which culminated in him being charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases in November 2019.  Mr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage.  He denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a politically motivated "witch hunt" engineered by his opponents.  Even if he is convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down as prime minister until the appeals process was exhausted - something that could take years.  'National emergency government'  Despite the corruption claims, Mr Netanyahu survived three inconclusive general elections in less than a year and won a record fifth term in office.  In each of the polls his main challenger was Benny Gantz, a former military chief who built an opposition movement on the basis of popular discontent with Mr Netanyahu.  image copyrightAFP  image copyrightEPA  Mr Gantz vowed never to sit with a prime minister under criminal indictment. But after failing to form a coalition with a majority in the Knesset after February's election, and with Israel battling the Covid-19 pandemic, he agreed to form a "national emergency government" with Mr Netanyahu.

But after failing to form a coalition with a majority in the Knesset after February\'s election, and with Israel battling the Covid-19 pandemic, he agreed to form a "national emergency government" with Mr Netanyahu.', 'authorsList': ['BBC News'], 'breadcrumbs': [{'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world', 'name': 'World'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/africa', 'name': 'Africa'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/asia', 'name': 'Asia'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/australia', 'name': 'Australia'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/europe', 'name': 'Europe'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america', 'name': 'Latin America'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world/middle_east', 'name': 'Middle East'}], 'description': "Benjamin Netanyahu is a shrewd political operator - and one of Israel's most controversial leaders.", 'probability': 0.869166, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697', 'dateModified': '2020-05-14T12:45:04+00:00', 'datePublished': '2020-05-14T12:45:04+00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<article class="css-14im5m3-ArticleWrapper e1nh2i2l0"><header class="css-94m6rd-HeadingWrapper e1nh2i2l1"><h1 tabindex="-1" id="main-heading" class="css-1c1994u-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10">Israel\'s Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM</h1><div><dl class="css-11c8au8-MetadataStrip e1ojgjhb0"><div class="css-8d0yke-MetadataStripItem e1ojgjhb1"><dt class="css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0">Published</dt><dd class="css-1n98t8y-MetadataContent e1ojgjhb2"><span class="css-1hizfh0-MetadataSnippet ecn1o5v0"><span class="css-1n712b9-IconContainer ecn1o5v2"><svg width="1em" height="1em" viewbox="0 0 32 32" class="css-47d2zd-StyledIcon e6m7o990" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true"><title>duration</title><path d="M17 15.4V6h-2v10.6l8.8 5.1 1-1.8-7.8-4.5z"></path><path d="M16 4A12 12 0 1 1 4 16 12 12 0 0 1 16 4m0-4a16 16 0 1 0 16 16A16 16 0 0 0 16 0z"></path></svg></span><span aria-hidden="false"><time datetime="2020-05-14T12:45:04.000Z">14 May</time></span></span></dd></div></dl></div><div class="css-2yhany-StyledTagContainer ed0g1kj0"><span class="css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0">Related Topics</span><div class="css-1emjddl-Cluster e1ihwmse0"><ul class="css-1oubwgi-ClusterItems e1ihwmse1"><li class="css-dh1p3g-StyledTag ed0g1kj1"><a href="/news/topics/cwgw7z7dvlwt" class="css-1sd1v8r-StyledLink ed0g1kj2">Netanyahu corruption trial</a></li></ul></div></div></header><div data-component="image-block" class="css-vk3nhx-ComponentWrapper e1xue1i80"><figure class="css-1759m9z-StyledFigure e34k3c20"><div class="css-kwaqyc-StyledFigureContainer e34k3c22"><span class="css-1xtcmof-Placeholder e16icw910"><span></span></span><span class="css-1ecljvk-StyledFigureCopyright e34k3c23"><span class="css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0">image copyright</span>EPA</span></div><figcaption class="css-1rnnz6t-StyledFigureCaption e34k3c21"><span class="css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0">image caption</span>Netanyahu is Israel\'s longest serving leader - and it\'s first to go on trial</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i81"><div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p><b class="css-14iz86j-BoldText e5tfeyi0">In more than 14 years as prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has become both Israel\'s longest-serving leader and the first to face criminal prosecution while in office.</b></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i81"><div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Lauded by his supporters as "King Bibi" and as a "magician" for his knack of winning elections, the leader of Israel\'s right-wing Likud party is fighting for his political survival as he prepares to stand trial on corruption charges. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i81"><div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>His success in polls has owed much to his image as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i81"><div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>He has taken a hard line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any discussion of peace, and long warned of danger from Iran.</p></div></div><div data-component="crosshead-block" class="css-mysbf6-ComponentWrapper-CrossheadComponentWrapper e1xue1i82"><h2 class="css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10">Brother\'s legacy</h2></div><div data-component="text-block" class="css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i81"><div class="css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949.

In 1963 his family moved to the US when his father Benzion, a prominent historian and Zionist activist, was offered an academic post.</p>\n\n<p>At the age of 18, Benjamin returned to Israel, where he spent five distinguished years in the army, serving as a captain in an elite commando unit, the Sayeret Matkal. He took part in a raid on Beirut\'s airport in 1968 and fought in the 1973 Middle East war.</p>\n\n<p>After his military service, Mr Netanyahu went back to the US, where he earned bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>\n\n<figure>image copyrightGPO via Getty Images<figcaption>image captionNetanyahu (R) was a captain of the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>In 1976, Mr Netanyahu\'s brother, Jonathan, was killed leading a raid to rescue hostages from a hijacked airliner in Entebbe, Uganda. His death had a profound impact on the Netanyahu family, and his name became legendary in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Netanyahu set up an anti-terrorism institute in his brother\'s memory and in 1982 became Israel\'s deputy chief of mission in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight, Mr Netanyahu\'s public life was launched. An articulate English speaker with a distinctive American accent, he became a familiar face on US television and an effective advocate for Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Netanyahu was appointed Israel\'s permanent representative at the UN in New York in 1984.</p>\n\n<h2>Rise to power</h2>\n\n<p>Only in 1988, when he returned to Israel, did he become involved in domestic politics, winning a seat for the Likud party in the Knesset (parliament) and becoming deputy foreign minister.</p>\n\n<p>He later became party chairman, and in 1996, Israel\'s first directly elected prime minister after an early election following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.</p>\n\n<figure>image copyrightGetty Images<figcaption>image captionIn 2019 Netanyahu became Israel\'s longest-serving prime minister</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Mr Netanyahu was also Israel\'s youngest leader and the first to be born after the state was founded in 1948.</p>\n\n<p>Despite having fiercely criticised the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, Mr Netanyahu signed a deal handing over 80% of Hebron to Palestinian Authority control and agreed to further withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>He lost office in 1999 after he called elections 17 months early, defeated by Labour leader Ehud Barak, Mr Netanyahu\'s former commander.</p>\n\n<h2>Political revival</h2>\n\n<p>Mr Netanyahu stepped down and was succeeded as Likud leader by Ariel Sharon.</p>\n\n<p>After Mr Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001, Mr Netanyahu returned to government, first as foreign minister and then as finance minister. In 2005, he resigned in protest at the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>His chance came again in 2005, when Mr Sharon - just before a massive stroke that left him in a coma - split from Likud and set up a new centrist party, Kadima.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Life and times</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>1949 - born in Tel Aviv</li><li>1967-73 - serves as soldier commando captain</li><li>1984 - becomes ambassador to UN</li><li>1988 - enters Knesset and government</li><li>1996 - becomes prime minister</li><li>1999 - loses election</li><li>2002-03 - serves as foreign minister</li><li>2003-05 - serves as finance minister; resigns over withdrawal from Gaza</li><li>Dec 2005 - wins back leadership of Likud party</li><li>2009 - returns as prime minister</li><li>2013 - re-elected as prime minister</li><li>2015 - wins fourth term</li><li>2019 - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-47409739">charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust</a></li><li>2020 - begins fifth term</li></ul>\n\n<p>Mr Netanyahu won the Likud leadership again and was elected prime minister for the second time in March 2009.</p>\n\n<p>He agreed an unprecedented 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, enabling peace talks with Palestinians, but negotiations collapsed in late-2010.</p>\n\n<p>Although in 2009 he publicly announced his conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he later toughened his position. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31904962">"A Palestinian state will not be created, not like the one people are talking about. It won\'t happen,"</a> he told an Israeli radio station in 2019.</p>\n\n<h2>Conflict in Gaza</h2>\n\n<p>Despite his tough rhetoric and fulsome support for Israeli military action, Mr Netanyahu has not managed to put a stop to attacks from Palestinian militants under Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2012, he ordered a major offensive after an escalation of rocket fire into Israel, but stopped short of sending in ground troops.</p>\n\n<p>However, after a relative lull, cross-border violence flared again and after a surge of rocket attacks in July 2014, Mr Netanyahu ordered another military campaign.</p>\n\n<figure>image copyrightAFP<figcaption>image captionViolence from Gaza has drawn a tough response from Mr Netanyahu</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The 50-day war left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead, most of them civilians, according to UN and Palestinian officials.

Carel	Dan Amiram	Individual	https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/30/the-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat/?sh=49ff93be4612	How hard is it to ferret out securities fraud? It might be as easy as looking for how many times the digit `1’ appears in a company's financial entries instead of ‘9.’  A simple mathematical law that applies to everything from the height of mountains to the population of towns in Tajikistan can also be used to uncover suspicious numbers in public-company accounting, an expert at Columbia Business School says in a new paper.  Benford’s Law states that the quantity of most things in the real world is more likely to be described by a number beginning in 1 than any other digit, and the likelihood of it being described by other digits declines as those digits get higher.  When Columbia’s Dan Amiram and two coauthors applied Benford’s Law to public companies, they found the same rules hold true: Companies whose financial statements were significantly out of compliance with the law were far more likely to get caught by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities. And when companies restated their earnings, a before-and-after comparison showed that the new, real numbers complied with Benford’s Law while the old ones didn’t.  “It was absolutely shocking,” Amiram said of the study with coauthors Zahn Bozanic of Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business and Ethan Rouen of Columbia, which he says already has drawn inquiries from hedge funds, short-sellers annd the SEC. “Every year, every industry fits perfectly to Benford’s Law.”  That result might seem absurd, or at least counterintuitive, given the presumably random nature of things like the number of widgets sold or profit from an aluminum smelter. Why is it more likely that a company sold 10 widgets, or 10,000, in a year than 700 or 700,000?  The answer reflects the intersection of statistics and our method of counting things. As a pure matter of math, increasing the quantity of anything from 1 to 2, or 100 to 200, or 1 million to 2 million, means a 100% increase, whereas an increase from 9 to 10, or 9 million to 10 million, only requires an 11% increase. That means any count of something in the real world is far more likely to begin with a low digit than a high digit, including when a company starts the year with revenue of $0 and increases that figure each day.  “In this world, there are more small things than large things,” explained Mark Nigrini, a professor of accounting at West Virginia University and author of Benford's Law, a 100,000-word treatise on the practical application of the law toward fraud, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion and other skullduggery. “Any town or city would have a population with a first digit of 1 far longer than any other digit.”  The actual statistical probability under Benford’s Law is 30% for the digit 1, 17.6% for 2, 12.5% for 3, and so on down to 4.6% for 9. And that’s what Amiram found when he studied more than 40,000 public-company annual reports from 2001 to 2011. Benford's Law described those results in aggregate, whether across the entire dataset or industry by industry. Nearly 86% of the firm-year observations complied with the law.  Things got more interesting when he looked at companies that were busted by the SEC. (He drew his data from the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases database.) There, he found companies that were ultimately caught in accounting improprieties had a statistical measure of deviation from the results predicted by Benford’s Law of more than 20 times the average for all firms. Even more fascinating, that measure of deviation plunged in the three years before the companies were caught, supporting the widely accepted theory that the SEC only uncovers frauds after they start falling apart and companies can no longer fudge their numbers.  This method has the same flaw as many other fraud-detection tools: It turns up a lot of false positives, or at least companies that never show up in the SEC's enforcement database. Amiram suspects many of the companies that deviate significantly from Benford’s Law may actually be cooking the books but will never be caught, either because of the SEC’s limited enforcement budget or because they escape the agency’s five-year statute of limitations.  The reliability of this tool for detecting fraud is supported, however, by direct observations of companies that have restated earnings. Those companies showed a statistically significant shift from non-compliance with Benford's Law to compliance before and after they restated earnings.  “For same firm year, the same operation, the same firm, we have two sets of numbers,” Amiram said. “The corrected numbers are very close to Benford’s law, and the previous ones are absolutely off.”  To give one example, Sprint Nextel ’s financials deviated from the distribution of digits predicted by Benford’s Law in the two years before it restated earnings in 2001, and fell into compliance after that. AT&T results, by comparison, followed the law the entire time.  Fraudsters can try and fudge their numbers in a way that complies with Benford’s predictions, but it won’t be easy. In another test, Amiram deliberately altered Alcoa ’s financial results for 2011, changing sales, cost of goods sold and taxes randomly in 1,000 simulations. Alcoa’s measure of deviation increased practically every time.  Benford’s Law has been used in a large number of forensic applications, including voter fraud, Greece's effort to hide its debt, and determining whether digital photographs have been altered. It's also been in the toolkit of auditors for years, said Amiram, a former auditor, but only at the level of operating accounts. He said his paper is the first to apply the law to company-level financial reports accessible through databases like Compustat.  Amiram began thinking about a Benford's Law screen on financial results after a friend who is a professor at Dartmouth sent him a Facebook link to the `10 Weirdest Math Facts." He detailed Rouen, a Ph.D candidate, to study financial reports and quickly became convinced they had "finally found one of the most useful applications of that law."He's spoken to the SEC about his research, but doesn't know if the agency is using it.  Now he plays a parlor game with his students, separating them into groups of "truth-tellers" and "liars" with the first group compiling a list of the lengths of major world rivers and the second one making the numbers up. Benford's Law identifies the liars every time, he said.  When it comes to financial fraud, he said: "If you manipulate the numbers, 90% of the time you’re going to violate Benford’s Law."  Given the apparently rampant level of securities fraud that plaintiff lawyers claim to find each year, it is surprising they haven't turned to this tool as a first screen to determine whether they're suing the right company. Maybe they could even use it to find real examples of fraud, instead of waiting for the company or the SEC to disclose it first.

Even more fascinating, that measure of deviation plunged in the three years before the companies were caught, supporting the widely accepted theory that the SEC only uncovers frauds after they start falling apart and companies can no longer fudge their numbers.\n\nThis method has the same flaw as many other fraud-detection tools: It turns up a lot of false positives, or at least companies that never show up in the SEC\'s enforcement database. Amiram suspects many of the companies that deviate significantly from Benford’s Law may actually be cooking the books but will never be caught, either because of the SEC’s limited enforcement budget or because they escape the agency’s five-year statute of limitations.\n\nThe reliability of this tool for detecting fraud is supported, however, by direct observations of companies that have restated earnings. Those companies showed a statistically significant shift from non-compliance with Benford\'s Law to compliance before and after they restated earnings.\n\n“For same firm year, the same operation, the same firm, we have two sets of numbers,” Amiram said. “The corrected numbers are very close to Benford’s law, and the previous ones are absolutely off.”\n\nTo give one example, Sprint Nextel ’s financials deviated from the distribution of digits predicted by Benford’s Law in the two years before it restated earnings in 2001, and fell into compliance after that. AT&T results, by comparison, followed the law the entire time.\n\nFraudsters can try and fudge their numbers in a way that complies with Benford’s predictions, but it won’t be easy. In another test, Amiram deliberately altered Alcoa ’s financial results for 2011, changing sales, cost of goods sold and taxes randomly in 1,000 simulations. Alcoa’s measure of deviation increased practically every time.\n\nBenford’s Law has been used in a large number of forensic applications, including voter fraud, Greece\'s effort to hide its debt, and determining whether digital photographs have been altered. It\'s also been in the toolkit of auditors for years, said Amiram, a former auditor, but only at the level of operating accounts. He said his paper is the first to apply the law to company-level financial reports accessible through databases like Compustat.\n\nAmiram began thinking about a Benford\'s Law screen on financial results after a friend who is a professor at Dartmouth sent him a Facebook link to the `10 Weirdest Math Facts." He detailed Rouen, a Ph.D candidate, to study financial reports and quickly became convinced they had "finally found one of the most useful applications of that law."He\'s spoken to the SEC about his research, but doesn\'t know if the agency is using it.\n\nNow he plays a parlor game with his students, separating them into groups of "truth-tellers" and "liars" with the first group compiling a list of the lengths of major world rivers and the second one making the numbers up. Benford\'s Law identifies the liars every time, he said.\n\nWhen it comes to financial fraud, he said: "If you manipulate the numbers, 90% of the time you’re going to violate Benford’s Law."\n\nGiven the apparently rampant level of securities fraud that plaintiff lawyers claim to find each year, it is surprising they haven\'t turned to this tool as a first screen to determine whether they\'re suing the right company. Maybe they could even use it to find real examples of fraud, instead of waiting for the company or the SEC to disclose it first.', 'authorsList': ['Daniel Fisher'], 'description': "Benford's Law, which predicts the distribution of mountain heights and voting patterns, can also be used to uncover fraud.", 'probability': 0.9621771, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/30/the-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat/', 'dateModified': '2014-05-30T14:20:11-04:00', 'datePublished': '2014-05-30T07:47:00-04:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class="article-body fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article"><div class="article-sharing"><ul class="article-sharing__container"><li class="article-sharing__item"><a class="social-icon facebook" onclick="window.open(&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdanielfisher%2F2014%2F05%2F30%2Fthe-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat%2F&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')" aria-label="Share Facebook" data-ga-track="Facebook Click"><span class="screen-reader-text">Share to Facebook</span><svg class="fs-icon fs-icon--facebook" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 60 60"><path d="M32.9 49H25V30h-3.9v-6.6H25v-3.9c0-5.4 2.2-8.5 8.5-8.5h5.2v6.6h-3.3c-2.5 0-2.6.9-2.6 2.6v3.3h5.9l-.5 6.5H33v19h-.1z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="article-sharing__item"><a class="social-icon twitter" onclick="window.open(&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdanielfisher%2F2014%2F05%2F30%2Fthe-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat%2F&amp;text=The%20Simple%20Mathematical%20Law%20That%20Financial%20Fraudsters%20Can\'t%20Beat%20via%20%40forbes&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')" aria-label="Share Twitter" data-ga-track="Twitter Click"><span class="screen-reader-text">Share to Twitter</span><svg class="fs-icon fs-icon--twitter" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 60 60"><path d="M22.2 38.9c-3.4-.3-6.1-1.7-7.5-5.1h3.6c-3.9-1.4-5.6-4.3-5.9-8.4 1.2.6 2.3.7 3.5.7-2.1-1.6-3.6-3.4-3.7-6.1-.1-1.5.5-2.8 1.3-4 4.4 5 9.7 8.3 16.5 8.9v-2.7c.1-1.9.6-3.6 1.9-5.1 2.5-2.8 6.9-3.1 9.8-.7.2.2.5.4.7.6.2.2.4.2.7.2 1.1-.3 2-.9 3-1.4.5-.3 1.1-.6 1.7-1-.4 1.1-.9 2-1.5 2.8-.6.8-1.3 1.6-2.2 2.2 1.6-.2 3.2-.6 4.8-1.1-.3.4-.6.8-.9 1.1l-2.7 2.4c-.1.1-.2.3-.2.4.1 3.3-.6 6.5-1.9 9.6-1.9 4.2-4.7 7.5-8.6 9.9-2.5 1.5-5.2 2.4-8.1 2.9-5.5.8-10.5-.5-15.1-3.3-.1 0-.1-.1-.2-.1h.2c1.1.5 2.2.4 3.3.3 2.3-.2 4.5-.9 6.6-2.1l.9-.6v-.3z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="article-sharing__item"><a class="social-icon linkedin" onclick="window.open(&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdanielfisher%2F2014%2F05%2F30%2Fthe-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat%2F&amp;title=The%20Simple%20Mathematical%20Law%20That%20Financial%20Fraudsters%20Can\'t%20Beat&amp;summary=Benford\'s%20Law%2C%20which%20predicts%20the%20distribution%20of%20mountain%20heights%20and%20voting%20patterns%2C%20can%20also%20be%20used%20to%20uncover%20fraud.&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')" aria-label="Share Linkedin" data-ga-track="Linkedin Click"><span class="screen-reader-text">Share to Linkedin</span><svg class="fs-icon fs-icon--linkedin" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 60 60"><path d="M44.9 33.2v11h-6.4V34c0-2.6-.9-4.3-3.2-4.3-1.8 0-2.8 1.2-3.3 2.3-.2.4-.2 1-.2 1.6v10.7h-6.4s.1-17.4 0-19.2h6.4V27.9v-.1c.8-1.3 2.4-3.2 5.8-3.2 4.1 0 7.3 2.7 7.3 8.6zM18.7 15.8c-2.2 0-3.6 1.4-3.6 3.3 0 1.8 1.4 3.3 3.5 3.3 2.2 0 3.6-1.5 3.6-3.3 0-1.9-1.3-3.3-3.5-3.3zm-3.2 28.4h6.4V25h-6.4v19.2z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><p>How hard is it to ferret out securities fraud?

Carel	Michael Lane	Individual	https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/140343/how-to-get-a-job-in-compliance	It’s rather odd to have an industry that’s purging talent nearly across the board at mid and senior-levels while desperately hiring in one particular business area. But that’s essentially what’s happening on Wall Street. Banks are cutting costs and slicing salaries virtually everywhere. Just not in compliance.  Banks facing mountains of litigation and red tape from new regulations are thirsty for compliance staffers at all levels, and many are paying top dollar for the best candidates.  Deutsche Bank recently announced a plan to hire 500 compliance employees, BNP needs 475 extra compliance people and Standard Chartered has upped its compliance staff headcount by 30%. Then there is JPMorgan, which wants 13,000 more people working in controls, with a mix of fresh hires and internal transfers. They’re reported paying contractors north of $100 an hour for their services.  Clearly, the market has never been better for experienced compliance personnel. But what if your resume is missing that all-important “experience” aspect?  Touch the corners  The short answer is: it's not easy. Compliance is tough to break into if you don’t have the background, says Michael Lane, managing director of Compliance Search Group. Banks tend to want to hire big-name talent with direct experience. There are only so many veteran people to poach, though, so opportunities are starting to arrive for those with experience that touches compliance.  The best way to find a job in compliance is through a legal or operations track, says Anne Crowley, managing director at Jay Gaines and Company. Lawyers who work at banks, particularly those who work closely with general counsel, are beginning to earn more roles in compliance, added Neil Owen, global practice director of financial services recruitment for Robert Half. Even past experience as a paralegal can be beneficial, said Suzanne Havranek, fulfillment manager at Wall Street Services.  If you don’t have your JD, working in back-office operations – particularly in reconciliations – is a good starting point, said Crowley. “Banks want people who have been in the trenches, who understand the fault lines,” she said.  A great route for people with little experience is by working with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence controls, experts say. Banks often hire for these roles on a temporary basis, said Owen, giving prospective compliance employees an opportunity for exposure.  “There is absolutely an opportunity to transfer those skills into compliance,” Owen said. Client on-boarding is another way to gain exposure to compliance issues, says Havranek.  Finally, go work at a regulator. Banks often pull people from FINRA, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), not to mention state agencies.  Certifications  Earning a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS) credential will go a long way to opening doors. For senior-level roles, passing the Series 24 Exam administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a must. The American Banker Association runs a week-long compliance school in the autumn that is widely recognized.  Depending upon the specialization, firms like to see candidates with their CFA, MBA or Series 6 and 7. Audit and accounting training are big pluses as well.  Soft skills  Finding work in compliance isn’t just about experience and education, although that’s the minimum price of entry. Candidates need have a backbone to find work and be successful.  “You don’t need to be a jerk, but you need to be innately inquisitive,” said Crowley. “You often need to stand up to senior people. You need to be willing to say ‘show me,’ not ‘tell me.’”  That said, you must also be approachable. “Employees should want to come to you with anything,” Crowley said. But above all else, you must be ethical and honest, according to Owen.  Upside  “Compliance is so much more attractive than it was five to six years ago,” Owen said. With the deluge of problems banks have had, the attitude toward compliance officers has changed dramatically. “You’re not looked at as a cop,” Lane said. “You’re an integral part of the business now.”  Several chief compliance officers have recently been named to banks’ executive committees - something that would have been unheard of just a few years ago.  There is real opportunity for career progression,” Owen said.  Downside  Compliance departments within banks are structured much differently than they were years ago. As the units have gotten bigger, teams and individuals are beginning to be siloed into very specific roles, like covering one new regulation, according to George Kennedy, head of recruitment at Maywater Limited, a London-based international compliance consultancy and compliance recruitment firm.  Being a specialist helps with pay, but siloed teams also offer limited exposure and the work can turn dull.  Then there is the workload, says Kennedy. Despite the hiring, banks remain understaffed (hence the rising pay). The hours are longer and the stress associated with the job is on the rise, he says. The threat of having a blowup on your watch is ever-present.  In our recent informal survey, compliance and risk ranked as the third most stressful area in the industry, behind only investment banking and trading.

Carel	People's Bank of China	Organization	https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-to-back-fight-against-terror-financing-money-laundering/articleshow/60894554.cms	iBEIJING: After backing the BRICS declaration on terrorism naming Pakistan-based militant groups, China today said it will extend support to the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering in non-financial sectors.  "Money laundering and terrorist financing activities are gradually spreading to some non-financial sectors," the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, said in a statement, noting the risks in sectors like real estate intermediary services and jewellery sales.  The PBOC has already started monitoring and analysis in some of these sectors and will work with relevant government departments on anti-money laundering rules for non-financial industries, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported today.  Since China's anti-money laundering law became effective in 2007, supervision has improved, covering almost every financial sector, such as banking, securities, insurance, non-banking payment institutions and bank card clearing institutions.  According to a government guideline, made public earlier this week, China will coordinate supervision to counter money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.  By 2020, China should be able to effectively prevent and control money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion by improving laws and regulations and coordinating the work of different government departments, the statement issued last night said.  Observers say China's backing for anti-money laundering and terror financing efforts could lead to more effective measures at the international level to cut sources of finance to global terror outfits.  Shedding its earlier reservations, China had backed a tough declaration at the BRICS Summit earlier this month in Chinese city of Xiamen and identified Taliban, ISIL/DAISH, Al-Qaida and its affiliates, including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Hizb ut-Tahrir as terrorist groups.  "We deplore all terrorist attacks ... and condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever and stress that there can be no justification for any act of terrorism," the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, (BRICS) statement had said.  Considerable significance was attached to China endorsing the statement specially against militant outfits based in Pakistan, its closest ally, at the BRICS Summit in Xiamen as it had resisted their inclusion at last year's Summit in Goa.  The PBOC also dismissed concerns over strengthened government supervision of abnormal cross-border capital flow, saying that the monitoring will not disrupt normal and legal use of cross-border capital.  The monitoring work will be carried out backstage and does not require further information from citizens and enterprises, the central bank said.

Shakshi	Denmark	Country	https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/6/denmark-found-214-people-infected-with-mink-related-covid-19	Denmark’s State Serum Institute, which deals with infectious diseases, has found mink-related strands of the novel coronavirus in 214 people since June, according to a report on its website updated on November 5.  Meanwhile, one strain of the mutated coronavirus, which has prompted Denmark to cull its entire herd of mink, has been found in 12 people and on five mink farms so far.  Early this week, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the government wants to cull all minks on farms to minimise the risk of the weasel-like mammals’ re-transmitting COVID-19 to humans.  “It is very, very serious,” Frederiksen said. “Thus, the mutated virus in minks can have devastating consequences worldwide.”  Health minister Magnus Heunicke said half the 783 human COVID-19 cases in northern Denmark “are related” to minks.  The development has prompted fresh measures to stem the spread of the virus; more than a quarter million Danes went into lockdown Friday in a northern region of the country where the mutated variation of the coronavirus has infected minks being farmed for their fur.  The coronavirus evolves constantly and, to date, there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. But Danish authorities were not taking any chances.  In seven northern Denmark municipalities with some 280,000 residents sport and cultural activities have been suspended, public transportation has been stopped and regional borders have been closed.  Only people with so-called “critical functions” such as police and health officials and different authorities are being permitted to cross municipal boundaries.  People in the region have been urged to to be tested. As of Saturday, restaurants must close, and school students from fifth grade and up will switch to remote learning Monday.  “We must knock down completely this virus variant,” Heunicke said on Thursday.  Denmark is one of the world’s main mink fur exporters, producing an estimated 17 million furs a year. Kopenhagen Fur, a cooperative of 1,500 Danish breeders, accounts for 40 percent of global mink production. Most of its exports go to China and Hong Kong.  According to government estimates, culling the country’s 15 million minks could cost up to five billion kroner ($785m). National police head Thorkild Fogde said: “It should happen as soon as possible.”  Denmark’s minister for food, Mogens Jensen, said 207 farms were now infected, up from 41 last month, and the disease has spread to all of the western peninsula of Jutland.  Last month, Denmark started culling millions of minks in the north of the country. The government has promised to compensate farmers.  The country has registered 52,265 confirmed COVID-19 infections and 733 related deaths.

Carel	Egmont Group	Organization	https://tribune.com.pk/story/1522318/pakistan-blames-us-failure-curb-money-laundering	ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday put the blame of its failure to completely crack down on money laundering and terror financing on the United States and said Washington was not actively supporting its bid for membership of a global alliance.  In its capacity as co-sponsor, the US was not actively supporting Pakistan’s request for membership of the Egmont Group – a club of financial intelligence units (FIU) of 156 nations, said Syed Mansoor Ali, the Director General of Pakistan’s Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU).  Ali made the statement in a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that had called officials of the State Bank and the finance ministry to get an update on Pakistan’s request for the group’s membership.  The Egmont Group provides a platform for the secure exchange of expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Money laundering: FIA books Altaf Hussain for 'misusing KKF funds'  The official said in reply to a question that he did not know the reason behind the lacklustre US support for Pakistan’s membership. It is mandatory for an applicant state to seek the sponsorship of two members of the Egmont Group and the US and Japan had given their consent to Pakistan’s application.  Ali said both the US and Japan’s FIUs had visited Pakistan in November 2012 for observing the FMU’s facilities and systems.  The Financial Action Task Force – an inter-governmental body working to combat money laundering – recommends that its members seek the membership of Egmont Group also.  In September 2011, the federal cabinet permitted the initiation of the process of seeking the Egmont Group’s membership. It also approved allowing the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) and Japan’s Financial Intelligence Centre (JAFIC) to sponsor Pakistan’s membership.  Pakistan applied for the group’s membership in 2012 and the FINCEN and JAFIC conducted the onsite visits of the FMU. On the basis of their report, the Operation Working Group of Egmont technically cleared Pakistan’s membership, said Ali.  NAB urged to probe ‘money laundering’ allegations against Chinese company  However, the Legal Working Group of the organisation found some deficiencies in Pakistan’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act and rejected the application, he added.  Ali said that unlike foreign FIUs’ single-stage agreement, the FMU was following a two-tier system for sharing information. Pakistan addressed this legal objection in December 2015 by amending the AML law and adopting the single-stage agreement with the counterparts for the exchange of information.  Pakistan had shared the latest status with both Japan and the US, requesting them to resume the process of its membership, he said. “But the US is not actively taking up our request and we do not know the reasons,” said Ali.  Implications  The FMU and the law enforcement agencies are not able to completely analyse or investigate money laundering and terrorism financing cases wherever foreign jurisdictions are involved, according to the unit’s written statement shared with the standing committee.  Zardari's aide facilitated Ayyan in 'money laundering', says ASF official  It added that mostly illicit money emanating from Pakistan due to corruption and organised and other serious crimes went out of the country.  The assets acquired in Pakistan or abroad through illicit proceeds could be traced on the receipt of intelligence from the foreign FIUs or sharing of information with them, it added.  “Absence of any mechanism to exchange financial intelligence with other FIUs leaves us devoid of the opportunity to trace back the suspicious transactions having international dimensions,” according to the FMU statement.  “The platform of the Egmont would help the FMU in analysing the suspicious transactions and tracing the proceeds of crime, uncovering criminal assets across member countries by following the trail, thereby helping the FMU and LEAs in successfully combating the menace of money laundering and terrorist financing,” it said.  “I have got an impression during my interactions with foreign dignitaries that Pakistan was resisting to be part of Egmont Group,” said Saleem Mandviwalla, the committee’s chairman. He asked the finance ministry to actively pursue the case and report back to the committee next month.  Mansoor Ali said the group’s membership was very important for Pakistan and expressed the hope that the country might be able to get it next year. He said that despite engagements with the US, there had been no productive results so far.

Carel	CMS	Organization	https://gcn.com/articles/2015/08/20/medicare-fraud-prevention.aspx	By Paul McCloskey  One of the big guns in the government’s battle to reduce improper health care claims is the Fraud Prevention System (FPS), a nearly four-year effort by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to help automate the review of health care claims before, during and after they are filed. FPS is critical to CMS’ plan to move away from “pay and chase” to a prevention model of claims management in its fight against fraud.  In the past, CMS typically paid a claim, then checked its validity before making a decision to try to recover the funds if it discovered they had been paid improperly. That approach has made it easy for fraudsters to elude regulators by sending up a smoke screen of false claims and counter-claims during the payment process.  FPS uses predictive analytics to flag providers and other players in the health care supply chain who might have participated in payment fraud.  As in anti-fraud approaches in the credit card industry, FPS enables CMS to assign risk scores to specific claims and providers, thereby establishing a starting point for analysts to pursue a potential fraud case.  When FPS identifies irregular activity, it automatically generates potential investigative leads for program integrity contractors — the teams of experts and data scientists who can help identify actions that can be taken immediately, such as suspending payment or launching a case review.  CMS officials say the success of FPS often depends on quickly detecting fraudulent payments, a goal for which it is enhancing some of its response systems. Responding to a suggestion by the Government Accountability Office, CMS has improved the integration of FPS with its claims-processing system, giving FPS the ability to stop payment of improper claims by transmitting a claim denial message directly to the payment system.  “What this means is that FPS can identify billing patterns and claim aberrancies that would be undetectable or difficult to detect by CMS’ current claim edit modules or a single contractor reviewing on a claim-by-claim basis,” Shantanu Agrawal, director of the CMS Center for Program Integrity, said during a hearing held earlier this year by the House Ways and Means Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee.  Industry players say FPS shows promise but is still young. Louis Saccoccio, CEO of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, told the subcommittee that “it will take time to effectively refine and adjust the models for such a large and complex system as Medicare in order to realize the full potential that these powerful technologies offer.”  About the Author  Paul McCloskey is senior editor of GCN.

Shakshi	Benjamin Netanyahu	Individual	https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/10/14/is-the-normalisation-deal-really-a-win-for-israel/	The signing of the deal normalising relations between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates caused a stir in the Middle East. It seems Israel is increasingly gaining political ground in the region, expanding trade and financial relations, and solidifying an Arab-Israeli axis against Iran. All of this is happening against the will of the Palestinian people and without any concession from the Israelis.  These developments have raised a number of important questions on the political scene in the Middle East. Does this diplomatic success for Israel mean that the Palestinian question has been completely sidelined in Arab politics? Have Palestinians lost their “veto power” on the normalisation of relations between Arab states and Israel? Will the UAE be able to bypass the Palestinians, the original owners of the cause, and come up with a “solution” to the Palestinian issue?  The Palestinian loss of ‘veto power’  For decades, there has been a consensus among Arab states that any dealings with Israel have to be conditioned on a “land for peace” arrangement that includes its withdrawal from the territories it occupied during the 1967 war. That is, the Israelis would have to give up occupied territory for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in exchange for normalising relations with Arab countries.  This consensus gave an unspoken “veto power” on normalisation to the Palestinians, making the resolution of the Palestinian issue the only way in which Israel would be accepted in the Arab world.  What the Emirati-Bahraini-Israeli agreement has done is basically sideline this past Arab consensus on how to deal with the Palestinian issue and make public what has been going on informally for years – the normalisation of relations between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi.  It demonstrates Emirati and Bahraini disregard for the long-term Arab position of “land for peace”. Abu Dhabi and Manama have effectively given the Israelis what they want – open political relations, trade, and backing for their anti-Iran confrontation efforts – without any real concessions on the Palestinian issue.  For the Palestinians, this is a clear attempt to preserve the status quo and allow the Israelis to continue stealing Palestinian land, demolishing Palestinian homes, imprisoning and killing Palestinians and altogether solidifying their apartheid rule. Contrary to what the Emiratis have claimed, this deal has not stopped the annexation of Palestinian lands on the ground.  The Israelis do not hide their optimism that establishing full diplomatic relations with the UAE and Bahrain will open the door to establishing full relations with other countries, such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and perhaps Sudan. If these normalisation deals continue, then it would mean that the Palestinians have lost their “veto power” on normalisation with Israel and their cause has lost its political value to the Arab regimes.  While the deal is indeed bad news for the Palestinians, it is important not to exaggerate its significance. Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Washington have touted it as a “peace for peace” (as opposed to “land for peace”) initiative, trying to equate it to the peace agreements Egypt and Jordan concluded with Israel in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the architect of the deal, like most Israelis, knows very well that any such comparison is unrealistic.  After all, neither Bahrain nor the UAE has actually been at war with Israel and they also have no common borders, unlike Jordan and Egypt, which waged deadly wars against the Israelis. The peace deals that the two countries signed with Israel not only put an end to hostilities but also forced Israel to withdraw from territories it had occupied.  Nothing of such political importance was contained in the “peace” deal that Bahrain, the UAE and Israel signed last month.  The UAE, a peacemaker?  As bad as this deal is for the Palestinians, it does not make the Palestinian issue go away. Despite all the noise and PR, Israelis very well realise that normalisation of relations with Gulf nations will not “get rid of” millions of Palestinians. It cannot erase them from history or from reality.  There seems to be some hope among some moderate Israelis that the UAE, the new self-declared “peacemaker” of the region, could use the deal as a stepping stone and wield its influence to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a recent article, former Israeli diplomat, Nadav Tamir, wrote about the possibility of Abu Dhabi initiating new negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Tel Aviv to produce a settlement that includes a separate Palestinian state.  The success of such an initiative, however, is highly unlikely, given that the relations between Ramallah and Abu Dhabi are at an all-time low. The PA has made it clear it considers the Emirati deal with Israel a “betrayal” and has issued strongly-worded condemnations.  If the UAE fails to play a useful role in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians, Tamir fears that the agreement with the UAE could turn from a tactical achievement to strategic harm.  In the short-term, normalisation with Israel only adds to the isolation of the PA and could benefit Hamas – something that is not in the interest of Israel, which has long used the authorities in Ramallah to indirectly depoliticise and control the Palestinian population. In the long run, Arab normalisation with Israel without concessions on the Palestinian issue takes away the main Arab leverage to enforce a two-state solution, which could backfire.  A deeply weakened PA is likely to collapse and leave the administration of Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank to their occupier – Israel. Such a development would only further put to the fore the apartheid practices of the Israeli state, giving full rights to Israeli Jews, while oppressing and discriminating against the native Palestinian population.  This would likely provide even more fuel into the transnational grassroots opposition to Israeli occupation and apartheid, which is already putting significant pressure on Israel to give the Palestinians their rights.  In this sense, the continuing denial of statehood to the Palestinians by the Israeli right-wing ruling elite and the collapsing support for Israel among younger generations of Americans and Western Europeans puts the country even more firmly on a path towards a one-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians would enjoy equal rights. This would effectively mean the end of the Zionist dream of a Jewish state on all of historic Palestine.  The current Israeli political leadership is too short-sighted to see these potential developments. Netanyahu is enjoying the image boost the normalisation deal gave him and is probably hoping this would secure his re-election once the ruling coalition collapses and allow him to continue dodging jail over the corruption crimes he is being tried for. His premiership may well go down in history as the one that laid the groundwork for the end of the exclusive Jewish state in Palestine.  Thus, what may seem like a major loss for the Palestinian cause may turn out to be more harmful for the Zionist project. Sooner or later, the Israelis will have to face to consequences of denying Palestinian statehood.

Carel	Transparency International	Organization	https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worldwide-one-out-of-four-people-paid-a-bribe-last-year-8427183/	Slipping a $20 bill to the woman at the DMV might seem like a weird idea to you. Average people in the United States don’t tend to bribe their police officers or doctors. But worldwide, 27 percent of people say that they paid a bribe to get public services last year.  This statistic comes from Transparency International’s annual Global Corruption Barometer report, which surveyed people around the world about corruption. In some places, like Liberia and Sierra Leone, over 75 percent of people reported paying a bribe.  Even in the United States, 36 percent of respondents say that the level of corruption has increased a lot over the past two years. They pointed the finger largely at political parties—76 percent of people in the United States said that political parties were affected by corruption.  To get these numbers, Transparency International surveyed about 1,000 people from each of the 107 countries they looked at. That’s less than one percent of the population of most of these countries, and some of the questions on the survey might be seen as leading. (“To what extent is this country’s government run by a few big entities acting in their own best interest?”)  Still, the survey included some interesting stories of corruption. A woman in Venezuela had to bribe police to release her son who they had beaten and taken away for no reason. In Nepal, local officials made a list of fake mothers, to pocket money that was meant for women to give birth in hospitals rather than at home.  The survey didn’t just look at small bribes passed by hand between people either. It also looked a political bribes, parliamentary bribes, media bribes and medical bribes. The BBC writes:  It is political parties, “the driving force of democracies”, as TI calls them, which are perceived to be the most corrupt public institution.  That is, in large part, because corruption is not just about bribery. Almost two out of three people say they believe personal relationships are what help get things done in the public sector – one in two say their government is largely or completely run by special interest groups.  Corruption is, as the report suggests, a global problem, and one that isn’t going away. Very few people thought that their country was getting less corrupt. And while 9 out of 10 people in the survey say they want to act against corruption, many also reported that they felt they had no choice but to pay the bribes demanded of them.

Carel	Satti Charles	Individual	https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/fighting-fraud-behavioral-biometrics-cognitive-fraud-detection-i-3405	As fraudsters continually refine their techniques to steal banking customers' credentials, IBM fights back with new tools that use behavioral biometrics and cognitive fraud detection. IBM's Brooke Satti Charles offers a preview.  Satti Charles, a Financial Crime Prevention Strategist with IBM Security Trusteer, is enthusiastic about the new behavioral biometric analysis capabilities in Trusteer Pinpoint Detect, which uses patented analytics and machine learning for real-time fraud detection.  "This new behavioral biometric capability leverages cognitive technology that seamlessly analyzes users' mouse gestures, understanding subtle mouse movements, and delivers actionable risk recommendations," Satti Charles says. "And these capabilities help to maximize detection, reduce false positives and optimize strong authentication."  In an interview about IBM Security's new antifraud solution, Satti Charles discusses:  How behavioral biometrics differs from traditional biometric solutions; Why cognitive fraud detection is not just artificial intelligence; Potential use cases for detecting and preventing financial fraud.  Brooke Satti Charles is a Financial Crime Prevention Strategist with IBM Security Trusteer. Her primary focus is to highlight IBM's capabilities in fighting cyber-crime. Her career has been focused on research and reporting of cyber-crime, fraud, money laundering, insurance, terrorist financing, conflicts management, enterprise risk assessments and regulatory compliance. Prior to joining IBM, she held a number of roles at Bank of America and John Hancock/Manulife Financial Services. She is an accomplished writer and public speaker with a tremendous understanding of compliance and regulatory issues as well as the financial crime threat landscape.

Carel	Datuk Seri Nazir Razak	Individual	https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2020/11/02/scary-discovery-veteran-banker-nazir-razak-talks-about-prostate-cancer-diag/1918632	KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — Life was fine for veteran banker Datuk Seri Nazir Razak until one of his banker friends advised him to buy an insurance policy in October 2018 while he was in the UK.  In doing so, he was required to undergo a health screening as part of the procedure.  The basic health check-up then led to a shocking discovery which turned Nazir’s life around.  “I took a blood test and it was discovered that I had a high prostate-specific antigen score, which suggested that there might be a problem.”  Nazir was then advised by the doctor to go for further investigative screenings to get a conclusive result.  He then went for an MRI test and a biopsy over the next few months where he was diagnosed not only with prostate cancer, but it was discovered that it’s an aggressive one.  “It was a scary discovery as I had an aggressive prostate cancer and absolutely no symptoms,” he said.  To determine the aggressiveness of the disease, Nazir did a Gleason score assessment and discovered that his score stood at nine out of 10, which is considered highly aggressive.  He was then told not to waste any time and go for the surgery as soon as possible.  Nazir went for the surgery on February 5 last year to remove his prostate using robotic prostatectomy procedure.  This is where the surgeon sits at a control panel in the operating room and moves robotic arms to operate through several small incisions in the patient’s abdomen.  Nazir, who describes himself as a glass-half-full person, said although he was shocked by the discovery, he remained optimistic to recover from the disease as he was lucky enough to catch it at an early stage.  “The key to survival for prostate cancer patients is to catch it early and treat it before it escapes the prostate.”  He also admitted that he was fortunate enough to have a good support system – his wife, children and friends, who kept him upbeat to fight the disease.  “They kept being very positive although they may have had different thoughts themselves.”  He added that his wife, Datin Seri Azlina Aziz was very good in a crisis and helped him stay focused throughout the treatment.  Following the surgery, Nazir recalled that he went through a smooth recovery process for a few months before he returned to normalcy.  “Prostate cancer is not something to panic about. Those who go through it should remain calm so that they can make the right decision.”  According to the latest Malaysian National Cancer Registry Report 2012-2016 which was published last year, a total of 4,189 cases of prostate cancer were registered from the same period when compared with 3,132 cases between 2007 and 2011.  Of the reported cases, 68.6 per cent were detected at a late stage (III and IV), which was higher when compared to 2007-2011 report (60 per cent).  The report also highlighted prostate cancer as seventh most common cancer in Malaysia and third in males.  Road to recovery  Although the road to recovery was quite smooth for Nazir, the cancer experience was nothing short of a big lesson which changed his life priorities.  “One of the things I realised was that in my younger days I didn’t have the right work-life balance,” he said.  He recalled that he was very consumed by CIMB during his tenure as the chief executive officer and the group chairman with long working hours and a very little break.  “At the end of the day, work is important but it’s not everything.  “There is no point having all the money in the world if you don’t have a healthy body,” he said.  If he could reverse the time and do it all over again, Nazir said he would have chosen to be more disciplined and focus more on his personal life.  However, he now lives a healthy lifestyle by exercising, watching his food and going for regular health check-ups.  “But the biggest change for me is that I quit smoking,” he said with a big smile.  A new adventure  Moving forward, Nazir has taken one of his life’s challenges and is turning it into meaningful advocacy by sharing his experience to help his fellow countrymen gain more knowledge about prostate cancer.  The 53-year-old cancer survivor has teamed up with the Universiti Malaya’s Urological Cancer Trust Fund to run a five-year nationwide campaign dubbed #onlymencan.  View this post on Instagram  #onlymencan #prostatecancerawareness  A post shared by Nazir Razak (@nazir.razak) on  Nov 1, 2020 at 3:26pm PST  The idea came after Nazir realised there was a lack of awareness about prostate cancer in Malaysia.  After he returned home, Nazir met the committee at the trust fund to think of ways to give back to society.  However, he learned that there were capacity limitations when it came to having enough funds to run any sorts of awareness campaigns.  He then went on to raise a minimum of RM5 million from various foundations within his corporate network to fund his five-year campaign.  The first leg of his campaign, which takes place throughout November, will focus on educating people about prostate cancer and emphasising on the importance of early detection.  Citing recent studies he said late diagnosis among Malaysians is much higher than neighbouring Singapore (25 to 30 per cent) and the United States (less than 20 per cent).  As such he said the ultimate goal of the campaign would be to lower the number of newly-diagnosed advanced prostate cancer from the current 60 per cent to 30 per cent by 2025.  To better understand the general sentiment about prostate cancer in Malaysia, Nazir said they conducted a baseline study and interviews.  As a result, they found out that 15 per cent of Malaysians think women have a prostate, while 50 per cent think prostate cancer is something to do with urination.  “The level of understanding and awareness about prostate is very limited.  “We also noted that culturally people are reluctant to discuss prostate, simply because of the nature of the topic.”  Nazir also pointed out that many people may have symptoms such as urinary incontinence or impaired sexual functions but they tend to ignore it simply because they are shy to talk about it.  Apart from educating the society at large about prostate cancer, Nazir said his campaign will also focus on training general practitioners on how to deal with prostate cancer patients.  The campaign will be led by infectious diseases expert and UM medical faculty dean Prof Datuk Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman.  It will also include urology experts Prof Dr Ong Teng Aik and Prof Dr George Lee Eng Geap as well as prostate cancer survivors and key opinion leaders.  When asked why he decided to share his story publicly, Nazir quickly said he wanted to save lives and prevent people from going through pains by encouraging them to do regular screenings.  He also noted that after he opened up about his experience, many of his friends were encouraged to get checked.  “Every man has a 10 per cent chance of getting prostate cancer. The key to survival is early detection.”  He, however, agreed that many people are reluctant to go for regular screenings due to the fear of being diagnosed with a disease.  “I always tell them it’s not just about you; it’s about your family and the people around you.  “I just want everyone to know that in the case of prostate cancer, the chances of survival depends on how early you catch the disease.  “Get checked, detect it early and you’ll be able to survive and thrive,” he added.

While growing up, Nazir was sent to the UK at the age of 13 to pursue his undergraduate and post-graduate studies in the 80s.  It was there he met Azlina and they both are blessed with twins – a boy and a girl – who both are pursuing their masters in the UK at the moment.  Nazir is a well-known figure in Malaysia for his integral role in shaping and transforming CIMB Group Holdings Berhad into a leading regional financial group it is today.  He spent nearly three decades at the banking group, where he served as a group chief executive officer for 15 years and group chairman for four years before stepping down in 2018.  Despite leaving a legacy behind for turning CIMB Group completely around, Nazir said his venture into banking after he returned from the UK was totally accidental.  “I was initially planning to go into civil service as my late father thought one of us (the brothers) should do that.  “But Malaysia had changed when I came back and I was advised to enter the corporate sector.”  He said he was advised to go into banking as a stepping stone to corporate life.  Nazir then jokingly said as it turned out, his adventure in banking was never a stepping stone as he remained in the industry for 29 years.  Following his resignation, Nazir still has a hand in a few businesses including furniture and food.  He also has a private entity firm in Singapore and does “bits and bobs” in Malaysia.
