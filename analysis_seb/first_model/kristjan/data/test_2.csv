404,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau has approved filing of a corruption reference against former prime minister Shaukat Aziz.

According to the notification issued by the NAB, former minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi was also nominated in the corruption reference.

Also, former federal secretary Ismail Qureshi, Yousaf Memon and Dr Naseem A Khan were nominated in the case.

The NAB stated that in violation of the code of conduct, the suspects are accused of appointing Basharat Hasan Bashir consultant. Bashir did not leave his office despite his tenure ending after five years.",1
944,"A New Zealand physiology professor says transgender athletes have advantages over their female competitors and more research needs to be done by sporting regulators before they should compete against each other.

Otago University professor in physiology Alison Heather has researched transgender changes, particularly in top level sport.

She is adamant international sporting regulation bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have rushed a decision to include transgender athletes in male and female categories, as there has not been enough research.

Heather says the controversial inclusion of Kiwi weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is a good example of the IOC not taking the time to research the science behind a transition.

""It could be seen as an advantage and that is why they have male categories and female categories.""

Heather believes there is a potential muscle memory effect for Hubbard, having competed previously as a man.

She said the increased numbers of myonuclei (muscle fibres) could potentially allow Hubbard's muscles to train better than if she had not previously been a male.

""Also, whether hormone therapy has reduced the larger skeletal muscle fibre area of her previous male physique is questionable.""

In 2015, the IOC changed their regulations to include trans women in the women's category of events if they remained under the testosterone levels of 10 nanomoles per litre (NMOL/L) a year prior to competing, as well as during competition.

However, a CIS female (a born female) can reach nowhere near the testosterone level of 10 NMOL/L. The average female sits at 2.8 NMOL/L and the average male 23-25 NMOL/L. This means the likes of Hubbard competes at three times the amount of testosterone to other weightlifting females.

""It hasn't been studied, but logical science will tell you someone who has three times more testosterone has the advantage physically. We need to do more research before arguing either way.

""I don't know what the solution is, but right now it is not fair on CIS females competing against transgender women.""

Heather said not only can testosterone levels give trans women an advantage over their CIS female competitors, after transitioning a trans woman's muscle mass, lung capacity and muscle memory all remain the same as when they were CIS male. That could give the trans female athlete a possible advantage when competing in activities that involve physical strength.

""The physiological attributes of males that makes them naturally stronger including anatomical and biological features such as size, muscle mass, lung capacity, and heart size would be an advantage.""

Heather said higher testosterone levels could give an athlete an advantage for power and speed sports.

""Higher testosterone levels could potentially have performance enhancing effects.""

The IOC settled on a maximum level of 10 NMOL/L for trans female athletes - a level Heather deemed as set ""without adequate research"".
""There has been very little research into elite male to female transgender athletes.

""Whether this normalising of hormone levels (and at 10 NMOL/L it is debatable whether they are normalised enough) removes the vast majority of the advantage of having been male is still an unanswered question.""

Heather said there has been only one study of eight non-elite recreational runners who had transitioned from male to female, and their performance times were very similar. She said it was unfair to base restrictions and regulations on one study.

As current regulations sit with the IOC, there is also no restriction around the level of haemoglobin (increased haemoglobin increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood). Scientifically testosterone positively influences haemoglobin levels.

""Given the lack of research, there is a real need to study what physical advantages transgender females carry after hormone therapy with consideration required for different sports, trainability and for performance.

""Until then, it is very difficult to conclude that it is a level playing field for CIS women versus trans women.""

The IOC based the 10NMOL regulation on the lower level of a CIS male of 10 NMOL/L - the upper range for a female is 3.1 NMOL/L.

At highest level, a CIS female with polycystic ovary syndrome can have up to two times or more higher levels of testosterone, meaning around 6 NMOL/L.

Disorders of sexual development (DSD) women have testosterone levels in the lower male range of around 10 NMOL/L, and this is another controversial point when competing at an international level of sport, says Heather.

In 2015, Indian athlete Dutee Chand challenged the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) in the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS).

The CAS ruled there was evidence that high testosterone levels do increase lean body mass, creating a competitive advantage and the IAAF must produce sufficient evidence about the relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance.

They suspended the 10 NMOLl/L ruling, and DSD women were allowed to compete without hormone therapy to lower testosterone levels.

Earlier this year, British Journal of Sports Medicine scientists Stephane Bermon and Pierre-Yves Garnier found there was statistically significant differences in the performance of higher testosterone female athletes versus lower testosterone athletes at the 2011 and 2013 International Athletics Federation World Championships across five separate events.

However there has been no change on the suspension of the 10 NMOL/L threshold for DSD athletes - but in the meantime, the new regulations for transgender women were set. Meaning trans gender athletes and DSD athletes are at odds also.

AT A GLANCE:
Transgender athletes
- Presently, they are allowed to compete with 3X higher testosterone levels than the high range CIS female.
- Although there is no scientific evidence to support that this provides them with an advantage, it is known that testosterone (androgens) provide an advantage to females.
- Increased endogenous androgens increase explosive performance.
- Exogenous androgens can be used to enhance performance  increased power, strength and training capacity.",0
181,"Computer antivirus pioneer John McAfee tweeted last year that he hadn't filed a tax return in eight years.

It was OK, he explained. He was ""done making money."" His ""net income is negative.""

""Taxation is illegal,"" he said.

Now McAfee has been arrested in Spain on tax evasion charges. The U.S. Justice Department has accused him of failing to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018 despite making millions, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.

He is accused of making money from ""promoting crypto-currencies, consulting work, speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary."" His extradition to the U.S. is pending, according to the Justice Department.

Prosecutors said he evaded taxes by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts set up in others' names, according to the indictment. He also allegedly concealed assets, including real property, a vehicle and a yacht, by putting them in other people's names.

I have not filed a tax return for 8 years. Why? 1: taxation is illegal. 2: I paid tens of millions already and received Jack Shit in services. 3. I'm done making money. I live off of cash from McAfee Inc. My net income is negative. But i am a prime target for the IRS. Here I am.

â John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 3, 2019

He could face up to 30 years in prison and $1.75 million in fines if convicted.

McAfee was once a prominent figure in the software sector.

He founded McAfee LLC, which Intel bought for $7.68 billion in 2010. The company was not cited in the indictment.

But in recent years, he's made international headlines for other reasons: his involvement in a murder investigation in Belize, a failed presidential bid, deportation from Guatemala, and his detention in the Dominican Republic, to name a few.

In 2012, he abandoned his residence in Belize after his neighbor, Gregory Faull, was killed. He fled to Guatemala after being made a person of interest â not a suspect â in the case and said he feared for his life.

He reportedly was in Belize in the first place to lower his taxes.

Eventually, his location in Guatemala was revealed through the metadata of a photo posted by Vice Magazine online. He was arrested over entering the country illegally and was deported back to the United States.

Then, last year, a U.S. District Court ordered McAfee to pay $25 million in a wrongful death lawsuit in Faull's death, according to the Florida Record.

McAfee said he would not pay and he was ""never suspected of murder"" in a statement he posted to Twitter in March 2019.

""I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits for the past 11 years. They have all been frivolous,"" he wrote, calling the order ""the legal extortion game aimed at America's wealthy class.""

The Estate of Gregiry Faul was just awarded a $25 Million judgement against me: https://t.co/OZ65Jirsb3

He claimed to have ""no assets"" and said he couldn't pay, even if a lawsuit demanded it.

On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York against McAfee.

The complaint claimed McAfee ""leveraged his fame"" to make more than $23 million wrongfully from 2017 to 2018.

McAfee is accused of recommending initial coin offerings of cryptocurrency to his Twitter followers without disclosing he was being paid. Instead, he passed it off as unbiased investment advice.

At the time of this writing he has 1 million Twitter followers.

Amid his international escapades, McAfee also made a foray into U.S. politics. He had two bids for U.S. president, first in 2016 and briefly again in 2020.

After originally floating the idea of creating his own party, called the Cyber Party, he ran both times as a Libertarian. He failed to secure the party's nomination either time.

A Twitter account bearing his wife's name, Janice McAfee, posted a statement Tuesday defending her husband (and noting that both her and her husband's accounts are ""staffed by interns."") Her statement, retweeted by John McAfee's account, said a team of lawyers are working to assist him.

""Regardless of whatever John may or may not have done,"" Janice McAfee said, ""he has spent most of his retirement fighting not only for his own freedom, but everyone's freedom.""",1
603,"As Rajasthan stares at a political crisis, those reportedly close to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot were raided by the Income Tax Department and probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) today.

The I-T Department has unearthed transactions that are now under scanner over suspicions of funds being used for political gains, sources have told India Today TV.

250 officials of the I-T department raided four close associates of Ashok Gehlot and his family at over 40 locations, including Jaipur, Delhi and Mumbai.

The Income Tax Department carried out search and survey operations on three groups on July 13. These operations are being carried out at 20 premises in Jaipur, 6 in Kota, 8 in Delhi and 9 in Mumbai, the I-T Department said in a statement.

Several incriminating pieces of evidence in the form of loose papers, diaries and digital data have been found indicating trading in bullion, in cash and investment of cash in properties. Further investigations are in process, the tax department said.

The Congress has questioned the timing of the raids and has accused the BJP of attempting to destabilise its government in Rajasthan amid the political drama that unfolded with Deputy CM Sachin Pilot threatening to walk out of the party with his MLAs.

Finally the advocates of BJP have come onto the field. I-T Department has begun their raids in Jaipur. When will the ED come?, Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned on Twitter, adding hours later, BJPs second team is also here. ED has also reached Jaipur, just like I had said. When will the CBI come?

WHO WERE RAIDED

Ratan Kant Sharma

Mayank Sharma Enterprises, with alleged links to Ashok Gehlots son Vaibhav Gehlot, was raided by the Income Tax Department. At least eight locations linked to Mayank Sharma Enterprises in Mumbai were searched by I-T Department who said, The source of investment in the same remains to be verified.

The director of the entity, Ratan Kant Sharma, is said to be a close associate of Vaibhav Gehlot, the BJP has alleged.

The Enforcement Directorate suspects that Ratan Kant Sharma had allegedly remitted large amounts from overseas transactions, including Rs 96.7 crore from Mauritius.

Ratan Kant Sharma, Director of Triton Hotels owned by Mayank Sharma Enterprises, also has stakes in Jaipurs Fairmount Hotel and is believed to be a business partner of Vaibhav Gehlot.

ED officials said a team visited the Fairmount Hotel in Jaipur today in connection with a money laundering case. Employees of the hotel were also questioned by the ED.

Sunil Kothari

Sunil Kothari, Managing Director of Om Metals, reportedly has close links with Ashok Gehlots relatives, sources said.

The company is involved in several business activities like hotels, hydropower projects, metal and auto sectors, I-T Department said, adding, It is suspected to have invested unaccounted income generated from these activities into real estate.

The I-T Department is in possession of the receipts of allegedly dubious transactions of the firm linked to Sunil Kothari, they said.

These said transactions allegedly were carried out through the hawala network, the I-T Department suspects and is probing to find if these transactions were used for political gains.

The department is also probing if there was any tax evasion by the firm and individuals linked to the transactions.

Searches were conducted at atleast three premises of Om Metals in Delhis posh Sainik Farm area. The I-T team of 8-10 officials came in around 8 am. We dont know what is happening inside. There are two kothis owned by Om Metals here, one of the guards told the media.

Rajiv Arora

The I-T Department raided premises owned by Rajeev Arora, one of the founders of Amrapali Jewels and vice-president of the Rajasthan Congress, in Jaipur and Kota. The residence of Arora, who is reportedly a close aide of Ashok Gehlot, was raided in Jaipurs Ashok Nagar along with his corporate office by officials today.

Suspicious transactions, including those overseas, are being probed by the I-T Department who suspect the money was used for gaining political mileage.

Officials said that Amrapali Jewels, engaged in the business of trading of silver, gold jewellery and antique silver articles, has associate enterprises in various countries like the US and the UK, as well as properties and bank accounts in these countries.

The main allegation against the group is that a substantial part of its silver jewellery business is carried out outside the regular books of accounts, the statement read.

Dharmendra Rathore

The Civil Lines apartment of Dharmendra Rathore in Jaipur, a senior Congress leader of Rajasthan, was searched by the I-T Department today in a series of raids conducted amid the political turmoil in Rajasthan.",1
449,"The chief fundraiser and senior adviser to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who played a critical role in the rise to power of the charismatic politician, was involved in the movement of millions of dollars to offshore havens, the Paradise Papers reveal.

Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, who was instrumental in Trudeaus successful bid for the leadership of the Canadian Liberal party in 2013 and the premiership two years later, engaged through his family investment business in a complex web of entities in the US, Israel and the Cayman Islands. Multimillion-dollar cashflows between the three jurisdictions might legally have avoided taxes in the US, Canada and Israel.

The leaked documents unveil a close relationship between two wealthy families who collaborated to shift millions of dollars to the Cayman Islands. On one side were the Bronfman family, inheritors of the Seagram distillery fortune in Montreal.

On the other side was the Cayman Islands-based trust of Leo Kolber, a former Canadian senator and powerhouse within the Liberal party Trudeau now leads.

Accountants working for the families discussed the possibility of recasting interest owed by the Kolber trust to two US-based Bronfman funds as services rendered, on the basis that the loans were not in substance (only in form). Tax experts say that such interest-free loans would generally be barred under US tax laws.

The disclosures are likely to generate political heat for the Canadian prime minister, who swept to power in October 2015 partly on his promise to tackle economic inequality and take on tax avoidance. Last year, Trudeau came under pressure in the fallout from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, during which his family inheritance was scrutinised.

At that point Trudeau insisted his personal assets, which he put into a blind trust after he won his partys leadership, were completely transparent. But he came under renewed pressure this year following a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) investigation into a KPMG scheme to help wealthy Canadians move money to the low-tax Isle of Man.

It is absolutely unacceptable that there be people not paying their fair share of taxes, the Canadian prime minister said in March, pledging to do a better job of going out and getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.

The Paradise Papers put the spotlight once again on Trudeaus record on tax fairness, only this time the focus falls within his inner circle. Specifically, on Bronfman, one of his closest advisers.

The two men are childhood friends who in recent years have revived their bond to assist Trudeaus meteoric rise. Bronfman, 53, raised $2m for Trudeaus leadership campaign and was was rewarded by being made the Liberal partys chief fundraiser with a seat on its national executive.

Bronfman runs Claridge, the Montreal-based investment firm set up by his father, Charles Bronfman, to manage the vast wealth of the Seagram liquor empire, which came to prominence in the 1920s supplying the illicit alcohol trade during US prohibition. The distinctive Seagram Building in Manhattan, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, still stands as a monument to the familys status.

One of Claridges clients was the Cayman Islands-based trust of Kolber, Stephen Bronfmans godfather and predecessor as chief fundraiser of the Liberal party who for decades was in charge of the Bronfman familys investments. Kolber was appointed to the Canadian senate in 1983 by Pierre Trudeau, Justins father, towards the end of his stint as prime minister.

The tight triangle between Kolber, Bronfman and Trudeau was on display last December when a Liberal party fundraiser, at $1,500 a ticket, was held at Kolbers Montreal home with Bronfman as co-host and Trudeau as its prize draw.

Confidential emails contained in the Paradise Papers reveal that links between the Bronfman and Kolber businesses were so close they were almost intertwined. In 1991, a Kolber family trust was set up in the Cayman Islands and Leo Kolbers son Jonathan named as one of its beneficiaries.

The Bronfmans helped kickstart the Kolber trust with an injection of millions of dollars of funds, the leaked files show, including a $5.3m loan made by Stephen Bronfman personally in 1997. By then the trust was flush with almost $40m in assets.

From the beginning, the arrangement between the two families over the repayment of the Bronfman loans was unusual. A contract tied to a Charles Bronfman loan in 1991 of almost $10m said: The loan shall bear interest at such rate as may be determined between the parties from time to time.

In 2002, the Kolber trust took on an $8m debt to the Israeli offshoot of the Bronfman empire, Claridge Israel  an enterprise that, in a further sign of the close ties between the two families, Jonathan Kolber had helped set up and run after he relocated from Canada to Israel in 1991.

For reasons that are unclear but do not suggest anything unlawful, the Kolber trust debt was transferred from Claridge Israel to two other Bronfman entities. The entities, Charles Bronfman Trust and Charles R Bronfman Trust, were US-based and thus liable to pay US taxes on any interest accruing, which would be treated as income.

In October 2005, Jonathan Kolber fired off an 18-page fax from his business offices in Israel about the Cayman Islands trust of which he was beneficiary. He hand-wrote on the cover sheet: CONFIDENTIAL!!

One of the documents in the fax was an email that was sent to him from a financial adviser. It noted that as a result of the switch of the debt from Claridge Israel, the Kolber trust had paid the US-based Bronfman trusts about $40,000 in interest charges.

The email went on to say: As there was never supposed to be interest paid on this debt in substance (only in form), the [Kolber trust] needs to be compensated by the Bronfman trusts for these cash outlays, in some manner to be agreed upon by both parties.

A second email from the financial adviser contained in the fax gives details of the manner by which the interest issue might be resolved. It records that senior Bronfman officials told Kolber that they would make you whole somehow.

One idea floated in the email was to get Kolber to invoice Claridge a fee for services rendered, equal to the interest which Claridge has charged to the [Kolber trust] on these loans. The Kolber trust would then mark on its books the sums as receivable fees instead of describing them as they really were  reimbursement of the interest payments.

Experts consulted by news organizations investigating the Paradise Papers said both the US and Canadian tax authorities viewed no-interest loans as red flags for potential tax avoidance schemes. Grayson McCouch, a tax professor at the University of Florida, told CBC that in his view the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would probably want to interrogate the transactions.

If its done to disguise or to reverse the purported interest payments, then it could look to an observer, particularly a revenue service, like evidence of fraudulent intent, he said.

Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told the Guardian that under US tax law any loan greater than $10,000 that charged no or below-market interest rates would be assumed by the authorities to bear imputed interest that would bring it up to applicable federal levels. The lender must report it as taxable income and pay taxes on it, he said.

The head of the international tax program at the University of Michigan, Reuven Avi-Yonah, told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that tax laws generally barred transactions that failed to report interest. You cant have interest-free loans between related parties, he said.

Jonathan Kolber stressed to CBC that he had relocated his familys trust from the Cayman Islands to Israel a few years ago following a change in Israeli tax law. The trust declared Israeli status and we paid back taxes and whatever they asked for, he said.

Kolber went on to deny any wrongdoing: Ive never broken any laws and this was all reported and so transparent, and is now an Israeli entity. This has all been declared and above board and properly handled with full transparency.

Stephen Bronfman and Leo Kolber declined to comment.

A lawyer representing Jonathan Kolber and Bronfman father and son denied any improper activity on their part. He said: None of the transactions or entities at issue were effected or established to evade or even avoid taxation. My clients have always acted properly and ethically, including fully complying with all applicable laws and requirements.

The lawyer said that the Cayman Islands trust was set up because of volatility in Israel at the time. Kolber was not liable for tax in Canada under existing law given that he no longer lived there; nor was there any tax owing in his adoptive Israel.

The lawyer confirmed that Stephen Bronfman did make a $5.3m loan to the Kolber trust in 1997, but said it was repaid within five months.

Of the proposed reimbursement of interest from the two Bronfman trusts based in the US to the Kolber trust and the suggestion that it be portrayed as services rendered, the lawyer said: No invoices were sent and nothing was paid. He added that non-interest-bearing loans by a US person do not violate US law.

764,"Law Minister Anisul Huq today said Bangladesh is firmly committed to fight against corruption and thus graft is being curbed in the country day by day.

He came up with the observation while addressing the 10th session of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) Implementation Review Group (IRG) in Vienna, capital of Austria, law ministry sources said.

âWe also expect that the international community would extend their full support to us, in order to materialize corruption free society which was a dream of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is the liberator of Bangladesh, and the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in 1971 for establishing a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh,â Minister Huq said.

He said, âArticle 20 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh provides that as a general principle, no person shall be able to enjoy unearned incomes meaning that the Constitution being the supreme law of Bangladesh prohibits corruptionâ.

Minister Anisul is leading the Bangladesh delegation, including senior officials from Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division of Ministry of Law, Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh mission in Vienna at the thee-day conference.

He said, âI would like to mention here that the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; the Criminal Law amendment Act, 1958; the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 (with latest amendment in 2013); the Right to Information Act, 2009; the Whistle Blower Protection Act, 2011; the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012; the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, 2012; the Extradition Act, 1974; the Public Procurement Act, 2006 and the Rules made thereunder; the Anti-terrorism Act, 2009; the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2009 etc. are major legal instruments in Bangladesh towards implementation of UNCAC provisionsâ.

âApart from this, Bangladesh has established the National Human Rights Commission and the Information Commission. Bangladesh has also adopted the National Integrity Strategy (NIS) by the Cabinet Division to build up a golden prosperous corruption free society,â Anisul said.

âCorruption Prevention Committees have been formed by the Anti-Corruption Commission in 9 Metropolitan Cities, 62 Districts and 421 Upazillas (local Govt. unit) with a view to creating integrity and honesty among members of the society by massive awareness programs. âHonesty & Integrity Unitsâ have been set up in Schools, Colleges and other educational institutions all over the countryâ, the law minister added.",0
1024,"I recently read an eye-opening report titled Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States by Richard Gordon, an American law professor who served on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Task Force on Terrorism Finance following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The report revealed that suspicious financial transactions could be noted in more than a dozen terrorism-related prosecutions which were analyzed as part of a comprehensive study of terrorism financing for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF). This jarring reality compelled me to share a few highlights from these cases (discussed later in this article) as they explicitly underline how immensely important it is for financial institutions to be diligent and vigilant in their monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity.

This sentiment was very strongly voiced by the Director of FinCEN last month in a speech which focused on terrorist financing and the important fact that BSA reports filed by financial institutions can identify suspicious activity which may ultimately prove to be related to the funding of terrorism. This stance was also endorsed by renowned counter-terrorism expert Richard Barrett at a congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing last week. Mr. Barrett testified that Suspicious Activity Reports filed by financial institutions may provide possible indicators of terrorist planning worthy of investigation. I have included some brief snippets from these commentaries and others below.

Finally, Ive concluded this article with 58 red flag indicators for terrorist financing from four different sources. I opted to provide readers with the original lists as compiled by these sources rather than remove redundant indicators and consolidate into a single list since the nuances of the different wording provides more detail or specifics in some cases for the noted indicators.

Director of FinCEN shares that 18% of the FBIs international terrorism cases in 2014 had related BSA filings and urges financial institutions continued vigilance and support.

A few weeks ago, the Director of FinCEN, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, made terrorist financing the theme of her speech at an anti-money laundering seminar for bankers. Director Calvery informed the attendees that The reporting your institutions provide has already proven to be an essential component in identifying foreign terrorist fighters, their financial facilitators, and the flow of funds and she urged financial institutions continued vigilance and support. She provided statistics that FinCEN processes about 50,000 new filings each day and that automated business rules related to ISIL, alone, generate over 800 matches each month for further review and exploitation. She added that Foreign terrorist fighters may use an ATM, a money services business (MSB), or a depository institution to send or receive funds to facilitate travel to Iraq and Syria. Director Calvery stressed that there is no doubt at FinCEN, or amongst our partners across government, that the reporting your financial institutions provide is essential to our efforts to disrupt, degrade, and ultimately defeat al-Qaida, ISIL and other terrorist groups. As Juan Zarate, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism so aptly put it  Money is their [terrorist groups] enabler, but its also their Achilles heel.

Sample Case Highlights  Credit Card Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud and Money Laundering Structuring

One noteworthy case in the above mentioned report Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States involved two small businesses  a deli and an ice cream shop. The case highlighted 12 feeder accounts held at multiple U.S. banks. Money was deposited into the feeder accounts by various means, including check deposits, cash deposits, and wire transfers. Bank records for the 12 feeder accounts revealed 3,252 cash deposits. The deposits were structured to avoid reporting requirements. Only one of them was a cash deposit for more than $10,000 triggering a reporting requirement. However, on each of several hundred days, an aggregate of more than $10,000 was deposited into the feeder accounts. The ice cream shop also operated as an unlicensed and unregistered money transmitter and over an eight year period, $22.1 million was deposited into the feeder accounts even though the small shop only had annual revenue of about $185,000. The funds were subsequently consolidated into a central account in the U.S. using checks and wire transfers from the 12 accounts; and $21.9 million was wired from the central account on behalf of customers in the U.S. to accounts in 25 countries, ultimately making its way back to Yemen. The recipient operators who controlled the accounts in those countries exchanged the funds into local currency and distributed payments to the intended beneficiaries. Evidence showed that the money transfers were tied to funding for al-Qaeda and Hamas. This case clearly illustrates that terrorist financers often uses classic money laundering typologies regardless of whether they are trying to launder the proceeds of crime. The study concluded that by using standard anti-money laundering typologies financial institutions should have been able to identify fourteen instances of terrorism financing as being suspicious, even though the FI might not see on the face of it that the suspicious activity was in fact linked to terrorism financing.

Other terrorist financing cases have involved bank fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, identity fraud and a host of criminal activities which we typically consider much less grave than the funding of terrorism. The FBI has indicated that numerous terrorist investigations have resulted from financial information provided by the financial sector and that is has assisted with connecting the dots.

Terrorism Financing Version 2.0  Counter-terrorism Experts Highlight A Dangerous Union: The Intersection of Terrorism and Organized Crime

A distinguished panel of witnesses all emphasized one dominant trend at last weeks congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing  terrorists increasingly are turning to crime and criminal networks for funding. Chairman Mike Fitzpatrick commented in his opening remarks that Terrorist groups have become entwined with trans-national criminal syndicates  or in some cases evolving into the role themselves  engaging in criminal activities which yield greater profits than simply relying on state sponsorship or big pocket donors. Expert after expert witness confirmed that shared view. The words in their testimonies were different but their message was the same. As terrorist groups have become larger and more organized and have sought to raise more money, they have been forced into closer cooperation with organized criminals and have copied some of their methods. Although terrorists continue to raise money through legal means such as collecting funds from witting or unwitting donors through established charities or by direct donation, David Asher, Board of Advisors Member for The Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance referred to the emergence of a trend which he termed Terrorism Financing Version 2.0. Mr. Asher elaborated that Version 2.0 represents a vast evolution above and beyond the traditional religious charities, mosques, and jihadi financiers and involves a substantial embrace of transnational organized crime. As illicit finance expert Douglas Farah succinctly summarized  The TOC [Transnational Organized Crime] / terrorism divide is increasingly disappearing.

In some cases, terrorist groups primarily pursue criminal activities for fundraising purposes. According to the DEA, 22 of 59 Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2014 were linked to drug trafficking. The DEA, the FBI, and the intelligence community have focused more and more attention on the nexus between drugs and terror and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has merged its international drug and foreign terrorism sections because of the intimate link between the two. Juan Zarate who testified before the Task Force last month, stated that Americas enemies  drug trafficking cartels, organized crime groups, militant groups, and terrorists  are finding each other, as a matter of convenience and opportunity. Mr. Zarate emphasized that the overlaps between the criminal underworld, illicit financial activity, and terrorist operations and funding will continue to evolve as marriages of convenience emerge in common areas of operation.

7,"A Colombian who was one of the top financial managers and supervised money-laundering for a cocaine cartel accused of smuggling $10 billion in drugs into the U.S. was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in federal prison.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, 39, pleaded guilty in January to drug trafficking and obstruction of justice charges, the latter involving his role in setting up the torture, killing and dismemberment a cartel associate suspected of cooperating with authorities. In a brief statement, Montoya expressed remorse.

""There is no justification for what I did,"" Montoya said through a Spanish interpreter.

Montoya is the brother of the purported mastermind of Colombia's North Valley cartel. Diego Montoya Sanchez is also in U.S. custody in Miami and has pleaded not guilty to a 12-count federal indictment charging cocaine trafficking, money laundering, witness retaliation and obstruction of justice. Another brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, is serving a 22-year prison sentence in the U.S. his role in the drug cartel.

The Montoyas are accused of overseeing a cocaine empire that smuggled cocaine into the U.S. beginning in the 1990s. U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga set a July 10 hearing to consider whether Montoya can pay restitution to the U.S. government for his drug activities.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis said most of Montoya's assets have been seized by the Colombian government and that the additional time is needed to determine how much he could pay.

Eugenio Montoya, who has been cooperating with U.S. authorities, previously admitted his role as a top financial manager of the cartel. Among his duties was handling a series of so-called ""stash houses"" in Colombia where about $20 million in U.S. currency was hidden. Montoya also made numerous real estate investments and oversaw a computer equipment business.

Testified about torture
The obstruction charge stems from the August 2003 killing of Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, known as ""Dos Mil,"" whose main job was handling pagers and cell phones for the Montoya organization. According to court documents, Garcia was tortured at a farm outside Cali, Colombia, on orders from Diego Montoya to find out if he had talked with U.S. officials during a visit to South Florida.

""Methods used included hitting Garcia Giraldo with baseball bats in the shins and other parts of the body, holding his head under water, and asphyxiating him with a plastic bag over his head,"" according to a statement of facts signed by Eugenio Montoya.

Although Garcia denied being an informant, he was beaten to death and dismembered, his body parts thrown in a river.",1
304,"The Hawaii Police Department said Friday that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has experienced an increase in reporting of financial crimes by individuals and businesses.

Those include identity thefts, theft offenses related to credit cards, computer-related crimes, forgery and financial exploitation.

âWeâve certainly had an uptick in fraud-type incidents,â said Lt. Rio Amon-Wilkins of the departmentâs Criminal Investigations Section in Hilo.

For example, he said there has been increase in scam calls to peopleâs cellphones.

âAnd then thereâs been a fair amount of mail thefts â¦ people reporting that credit cards and loan applications were applied for and granted in their name,â he said. âThereâs also been a handful of cyber crime issues involving apps. Somehow, these mobile apps are being linked to peopleâs bank accounts, and (criminals) are able to withdraw money from there. Theyâre able to withdraw great sums of money from their checking and savings accounts, and tracing that is extremely difficult.â

âParticularly during crisis situations, there is always an uptick in bad actors who take advantage of honest people,â said Krishna Jayaram, a special assistant to the state attorney general. âDuring this pandemic, we urge our communities to exercise extra caution and follow the recommendations of the Hawaii Island police.â

Police say many of the offenses are sophisticated crimes perpetuated by cyber criminals through âphishingâ and âspoofingâ â which are fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords and financial information by electronic communication.

Forms of communications include emails, phone calls and websites that originate from an unknown source but appear as being from a known or trusted source. The goal is to gain access a victimâs personal financial information, or spreading malware through infected links or attachments.

With the heavy reliance of computers, mobile devices and networks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber criminals are exploiting the vulnerability of individuals and businesses through data breaches of financial accounts. They also are targeting online shoppers, as well as focusing on stealing stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and paycheck protection program payments.

âSocial distancing and lockdowns are not slowing the business of fraud,â said Kealiâi Lopez, AARP Hawaii state director. âThe pandemic â and having more people staying home and working from home â has given scammers more opportunities to come up with new ways to take your money.

âWeâre seeing it at AARP Hawaii in the kinds of emails and text messages weâre getting. For example, one of our staff recently got text messages that appear to be a package scam, something the Federal Trade Commission recently warned us about. Donât click on the links in emails or text messages. Even messages from friends or government agencies can be spoofed and may not really be from them.â

Package scams are a phishing scam where the victim receives an email saying they have a package waiting for them and contains a link. That link leads to questions that ask for financial and personal information that shouldnât be given to unknown parties, and also allows the scammers to download malware on the victimâs device that could steal passwords and financial information.

While not totally eliminating the possibility of becoming a victim, police recommend taking the following precautions.

Conduct regular checks of your banking statements for accuracy and report any irregularities to your financial institution.

If your occupation requires you to work from home, you should consider a separate router to separate your home and work network traffic and using the strongest security configuration for online protection.

When examining an email to determine its legitimacy, look for unusual phrases, grammatical or spelling errors, or transposing of letters in the URL, also referred to as the âweb address,â because these are often indicators of spoofing or phishing attempts.

Donât click on unfamiliar links or download attachments you may receive in any emails. Instead, delete them.

If using mobile or computer applications to perform banking online, set up strong passwords and change them regularly.

You should also set up âtwo-factor authenticationâ which involves logging into your account with your user name and password and requiring a time-sensitive code sent to the device which needs to be entered by the user for verification.

If you receive a mobile or land-line call from an unknown or unfamiliar number, do not answer it. Instead, let the call go to your voice mail. These ârobocallsâ often use applications to display an area code from your area along with a random or unused phone number. If you happen to answer the call or hear a recording, do not provide any personal or financial information. Simply hang up.

To prevent further robocalls, consider looking for a âcall-blocking solutionâ or download the âdonotcallâ app from the Federal Trade Commissionâs website.

Finally, if you become a victim of a financial crime, prepare a packet that includes your financial statements as well as documents supporting the crime, such as emails, invoices, receipts, and others, to turn over to police when reporting the incident. It is recommended that you also retain a copy of all of your documents for file.

âStay vigilant. Log into your accounts regularly,â said Amon-Wilkins. âIf you see any suspicious activity at all, contact the police and contact the financial institution. And I always recommend not putting anything with a check or anything with confidential personal information in your mailbox at home. You should take it to the post office.

ââ¦ It think itâs also a great recommendation for people to get mailboxes that lock, so when you do put mail in there, itâs a lot more difficult for people to steal it from the box.â

In addition, the AARP Fraud Watch Network offers resources and help for victims of fraud. Itâs available at aarp.org/fraud or by calling 1-877-908-3360.

âWhether they are phishing with emails from your utility company or calling pretending to be contact tracers, the bottom line is they are trying to get your data and your money,â Lopez said.

193,"Four narco-signs appeared this morning in Playa del Carmen bearing messages that suggest Monday morningâs shooting at a beachfront bar was related to drug trafficking.

âThis is a warning that we are already here because you didnât align yourself Phillip â BPM,â the message read. âIt is the beginning, we are going to cut off the heads of Golfos, Pelones and chapulines. Sincerely, El Fayo Z from the old school.â

âPhillipâ is presumably BPM Festival co-founder Phillip Pulitano while âGolfosâ and âPelonesâ could refer to the drug gangs Cartel del Golfo and Los Pelones.

The message could mean that the Zetas cartel was behind the shooting.

The Facebook-based news outlet Semanario Playa News, which broke the story of the narco-signs, reported that âFayo Zâ could be Quintana Roo Zeta leader Rafael del Ãngel Velez Morales.

Five people died and 15 were wounded in gunfire at the Blue Parrot, a venue for the closing night of the 10-day BPM Festival, an international electronic music festival held annually in Playa del Carmen.

The stateâs Attorney General said this morning that investigators were examining the possibility that drug sales were the principal motive in the shooting, caused by dealers fighting over territory.

Miguel Ãngel Pech has said that extortion is also being considered as a motive.

He said security video shows the attacker enter the bar and fire five times at a man who has been identified as part of the festivalâs security team. However, his family said the man, who lived in Veracruz, was actually a telephone company employee on vacation in the Riviera Maya resort city.

The shooter is believed to have fled in a taxi, whose driver has a criminal record for extortion and is also a former municipal police officer.

The dead have been identified as:

â¢ Kirk Wilson, a Canadian who was the festivalâs security supervisor at the Blue Parrot;

â¢ Daniel Pessina, an Italian and a member of the festival staff;

â¢ Alejandra Margarita Villanueva Ibarra, from the U.S.;

â¢ Geovanni Francisco Ruiz Murillo, of Veracruz; and

â¢ Rafael Antonio PeÃ±aloza Vega, also of Veracruz.

Authorities have not said which of the victims the attacker was after.

However, the newspaper Milenio reported that Ruiz Murillo, who was hit four times during the shooting, had two Facebook profiles, one of which showed him in a police uniform and carrying arms.

In the other his profile picture showed him with an AK-47 firearm and a post advised he had a new job.

This yearâs BPM Festival was the 10 th but may well be its last, in Playa del Carmen at least. âAt the moment our position is that BPM will not happen [again],â said Mayor Cristina Torres GÃ³mez yesterday afternoon.

She told a press conference there would be a reassessment of the requirements and procedures for obtaining permits in terms of security so as to guarantee the safety of tourists and residents.

â. . . we have to analyze the type of destination we want to have, what type of events we want to have and promote . . . .â

Another similar festival, Arena Festival 2017, scheduled for February 1-6, has been suspended while stronger security measures are considered, the mayor said.

The business community made its position clear yesterday. âWeâre asking for these kinds of events to go away,â said MarÃ­a Helena Mata Pineda, president of the local branch of the Business Coordinating Council. âWe donât want BPM here anymore, or any other similar event.â",1
216,"It took three years but a leading federal bank regulator has finally gotten tough with probably the most lawless large financial institution in the country.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, recently took action against the former chief executive of Wells Fargo in connection with the scandal in which the bank pressured employees to create bogus accounts that extracted millions of dollars in fees from unsuspecting customers.

Many observers were surprised that the OCC, not known for aggressive action, fined John Stumpf $17.5 million â the largest penalty it has ever imposed on an individual â and banned him for life from the banking industry. The agency also penalized two other former senior officials at Wells Fargo and charged five others. Among those five is Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of retail banking at Wells, against whom the OCC is seeking a penalty of $25 million, substantially more than what Stumpf agreed to pay.

OCCâs belated severity may have something to do with the fact that the agencyâs posture toward Wells is the subject of a pending investigation by the Treasury inspector general. That inquiry will likely address the failure of the agency to pursue complaints it had received about abusive practices at Wells long before the sham-account scandal erupted in 2016. The agency admitted this lapse in an unflattering report about its conduct released in 2017.

Along with the announcement of its charges against Tolstedt and the others, the OCC released a 100 page Notice which reads like an indictment. It argues that for more than a decade the bank maintained a business model that pressured employees to engage in âserious misconductâ by imposing âintentionally unreasonable sales goalsâ and âfostered an atmosphere that perpetuated improper and illegal conduct.â

The document relates in detail how that pressure worked to the detriment both of the customers who were being defrauded and the bankâs lower level employees. Those employees were turned into accomplices in a corrupt scheme described by the document as âimmenseâ in magnitude.

Also contained in the document are indications that Wells managers were seeking to cover up the wrongdoing. They pretended to monitor improper conduct by lower-level employees but were far from aggressive in that effort. The document notes that the bankâs Head of Corporate Investigations testified before the OCC that there was nearly a 100% chance an employeeâs boss would know if she failed to meet her sales goals, but the chances were very small that an employee would be caught for issuing an unauthorized product or service. Those employees clearly got the message that if they wanted to keep their jobs they had to go along with the scheme.

Unfortunately, the document is part of a civil proceeding when it should really be part of a criminal case against Wells and those who were running it. The shocking misconduct outlined by the OCC belongs in an indictment brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

There are reports that the Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Wells, but it is hard to be confident that Bill Barrâs DOJ will do the right thing.",1

Bank De-Risking Hurts Charities and Increases Risk of Laundering
A lack of access to financial services, particularly the inability to transfer funds overseas, can prevent lifesaving work from being carried out and has touched the refugee crisis in Europe, where many aid groups are delivering assistance.
November 4

The United States and United Kingdom recently published detailed money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments identifying both law enforcement and national security challenges. Read together, both the U.S. and U.K. risk assessments provide a stronger understanding of how two leading economies approach myriad money laundering and terrorist financing risks to help stakeholders better identify, analyze, and mitigate the challenges that they face.

These reports support the broader legal and policy architecture around anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism of each country using the risk-based approach under the Financial Action Task Force, and comport with applicable FATF guidance. Although the reports cover the same general subjects, they suggest both similarities and differences in how the two nations view various threats.

What follows is a comparative analysis of the assessments' structure and scope, as well as how they treated the specific issues of beneficial ownership and digital currencies.

Structure and Scope

The U.K. and U.S. assessments both identified threats, vulnerabilities and consequences within industries impacted by money laundering and terrorist financing.

The U.K. took an empirical approach, attempting to quantify the levels of risk within each industry and giving each a ""score"" based on a range of factors. The attempt to measure and quantify risk by industry and payment method was creative, but the result does not appear sufficient to clarify stakeholders' obligations to combat laundering using a risk-based approach. The U.K. report also included an assessment of its government's capabilities. It recognized that some supervisory regimes were ""inconsistent"" and described the law enforcement response to money laundering until 2012 as ""weak.""

The U.S. assessments, by contrast, focused primarily on government and law enforcement efforts to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. The assessments were drafted by Treasury's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, in consultation with other government offices. The U.S. reports were exhaustively researched, examining over 5,000 money-laundering indictments and other charging documents, along with 229 terrorism-related cases.

Like the U.K. report, the U.S. assessments identified risks and vulnerabilities within impacted industries. However, the terrorist-financing assessment contained no explicit private sector input, while private sector participation in the money laundering assessment was indirect  through submission of suspicious activity and currency transaction reports reviewed and analyzed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. One analysis suggested that the U.S. reports should be understood in the context of the current FATF peer review of the U.S. AML and CFT framework, scheduled for public release in January 2016, which may suggest another audience that the U.S. was attempting to engage through its assessment.

The most striking dissimilarity in the structure of the reviews is that the U.K. assessment combined its money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments into one report, the National Risk Assessment, while the U.S. analysis split the two topics into separate assessments: the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and the National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment.

The U.K. report primarily focused on money laundering, with only the final chapter devoted to terrorist financing. However, it emphasized that terrorists often use the same methods to raise, store and move funds as those involved in laundering money, which partially explains why its terrorist financing assessment was so brief. In contrast, the U.S. terrorism financing report thoroughly explored many ways that terrorists obtain financing  including kidnapping for ransom, drug trafficking, and individual fundraising not affiliated with a charitable organization  none of which were in the U.K. report.

Beneficial Ownership

Both the U.S. and U.K. reports discussed the complex and politically charged issue of beneficial ownership. In the banking context, a beneficial owner is the individual who owns or controls a bank account. The use of nominees and shell companies, along with providing inaccurate beneficial owner information, were identified as vulnerabilities to banks.

The U.K. report dedicated an entire chapter to the money laundering threats and vulnerabilities posed by legal entities and arrangements such as companies, trusts, and partnerships with hidden owners. Importantly, the U.K. report described how corporate structures could be used to hide the natural individuals directing those structures. The report also identified information gaps in so-called ""high-end"" money laundering activities facilitated by professional enablers, particularly those in the legal and accounting fields, using financial institutions and real estate.

The U.S. money laundering report addressed beneficial ownership as one of five money laundering vulnerabilities to the financial system. Nominees and the misuse of legal entities were listed as risks as well.

As the U.S. money laundering report notes, the United States still does not have a federal beneficial ownership requirement for legal entities, although Fincen's proposal requiring stronger bank customer due diligence procedures is awaiting publication as a final rule. In July 2015, the International Money Fund published a particularly critical technical note that both described the AML and CFT risks posed by the lack of U.S. beneficial ownership legislation and suggested possible deficiencies in the pending Fincen rule.

These details are important because the White House recently published a statement mentioning the risk assessments as evidence of the United States fulfilling its pledges under the G-20 Beneficial Ownership Action Plan. In its statement, the White House renewed its commitment to advocate for comprehensive legislation to impose a beneficial owner requirement. But beneficial ownership reforms remain a contested political issue here. Some in the U.S. legal community contend that stronger requirements would undermine client confidentiality while state-level officials claim collecting the information would be burdensome.

Digital Currencies

Both the U.S. and U.K. reports evaluated the AML and CFT risks and vulnerabilities related to virtual currencies.

Virtual currencies are not currently regulated in the U.K. However, in August 2014, the U.K. government announced a ""major programme of work"" and published a call for information related to the risks and benefits of virtual currencies, and to whether government regulation was necessary. In March 2015, the U.K. government published its findings, concluding there is a ""strong case"" for introducing AML regulations. The U.K. report, using its scoring system, nevertheless deemed the current money-laundering risk associated with virtual currencies ""low."" The report said misuse of virtual currencies was primarily related to cybercrime and there was ""little evidence"" that virtual currencies have been ""incorporated into established money laundering techniques."" The report also concluded that criminals involved in terrorist financing were not currently using virtual currencies to raise funds, pay for infrastructure or move money into and out of the country.

The U.S. is a step ahead of the U.K. in terms of regulating digital currencies. In March 2013, Fincen issued interpretive guidance clarifying that administrators and exchangers of digital currency are ""money transmitters"" under a July 2011 rule, thereby obligating them to comply with the AML and CFT regulations that apply to money transmitters. Fincen announced its first digital currency enforcement action in 2015. Also, in June 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services released its regulatory framework for digital currency firms.

According to the U.S. money laundering report, although dealers in virtual currency are subject to the same U.S. regulations as other money transmitters and face the same risks of prosecution for misfeasance, money laundering vulnerabilities continue to mount. Risks tied to virtual currency include the rapid evolution of the market, spurred by more involvement from the technology sector, and the potential of some virtual currency dealers to operate without a domestic presence.",0
437,"A CONMAN who partied with Rihanna has been jailed for swindling investors out of £235,000 to fund his lavish lifestyle.

James Bufton, 26, posed as a successful stockbroker to fleece family and friends out of the cash.

7

He also conned £750,000 from taxpayers in a VAT fraud.

The shameless fraudster spent his ill-gotten gains on private helicopters, lap dancing clubs and gambling, a court has heard.

Bufton used a photo of him meeting Rihanna at an after-show party to build up his image as a high-living financial whiz-kid.

He mingled with the singer at a backstage VIP party following her show at O2 Arena - and boasted they got along so well she invited him to visit her in New York.

There is no suggestion Rihanna was involved in, or knew about, Bufton's activities.

The defendant told would-be investors he'd been trained by leading investment firm Goldman Sachs as he wined and dined them.

But a court heard the con unravelled after investors called in police.

Instead of being a high-flyer, investigators discovered callous Bufton had left his own aunt penniless after stealing his dying uncles life savings.

He also fleeced his then-girlfriend's parents, as well as a close family friend.

Prosecutor Timothy Evans said one of his victims described him as the lowest form of human being.

He said: They were all fair game. He took their money and spent it down the drain.

It seems to have made no difference to him whether these were close family, a dying man, a grieving widow, a family friend, his girlfriends parents, a businessman or someone he happened to meet in a club.

He developed a toolbox of dishonest techniques, using his persuasive manner, his fabricated successful persona, and forged and misleading documents to con anyone he could out of their own money.""

Anwar Nashishibi, mitigating, said his client was ""genuinely remorseful"" for his actions.

He told how Bufton had received threats and intimidation over his debts, including bricks thrown through his window.

The defendant's car was also set ablaze.

Bufton, of Newport, Gwent, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court, where he admitted fraud, VAT fraud and money laundering between 2013 and 2018, and was jailed for six years.

Judge Daniel Williams told the swindler: ""There were no depths that you were not prepared to stoop.

""You have no conscience or remorse for what you have done.""

Bufton will return to the court in the new year as prosecutors attempt to seize his assets as part of Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings.",1
288,"Enron Corp. founder Kenneth Lay, who faced decades in prison for one of the most sprawling business frauds in U.S. history, died Wednesday while vacationing in Aspen, Colo. He was 64.

Lay died of coronary artery disease, according to Mesa County Coroner Robert Kurtzman, who added that there was evidence Lay had a previous heart attack.

The Pitkin, Colo., Sheriff's Department said they were called to Lay's house in Old Snowmass, Colo., shortly after 1 a.m. He was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:11 a.m. Lay, who lived in Houston, frequently vacationed in Colorado.

Lay ascended from near-poverty as a minister's son in Missouri to the pinnacle of corporate America. He was considered a visionary who had President Bush's ear during Enron's halcyon days, but his reputation and monumental wealth shattered with that of his company.

""I guess when you're facing the rest of your life in jail and in your heart you know you're an innocent man, I guess it's too much to bear,"" said close friend Willie Alexander.

Lay turned a sleepy natural gas pipeline group into a model of new age capitalism, says CBS News' Harry Smith. Enron became a darling of Wall Street and at its peak turned a $100 billion profit.

Lay and former Enron executive Jeffery Skilling were convicted of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud on May 25. The verdict put the blame for the 2001 demise of the high-profile energy trader, once the nation's seventh-largest company, squarely on its top two executives.

Lay was also convicted of bank fraud and making false statements to banks in a separate, non-jury trial related to Lay's personal finances. All along, Lay insisted there was no fraud at Enron, Smith reports. But a jury wasn't convinced.

Family spokeswoman Kelly L. Kimberly issued a statement saying, ""Ken Lay passed away early this morning in Aspen. The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate. And out of respect for the family, we will release further details at a later time.""

Pastor Steve Wende of First United Methodist Church of Houston, said in a statement that church member Lay died unexpectedly of a ""massive coronary.""

Wende said Lay and his wife, Linda, were in Colorado for the week ""and his death was totally unexpected. Apparently, his heart simply gave out.""

Lay was scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 23. He faced decades in prison.

Skilling, reached by telephone at his home in Houston, told The Associated Press that he was aware of Lay's death, but declined further comment.

Prosecutors in Lay's trial declined comment Wednesday, both on his unexpected death and what may become of the government's effort to seek a $43.5 million judgment from Lay that they say he pocketed as part of the conspiracy.

Lay showed no signs of either physical or mental weakness before or during his trial, reports CBS News correspondent Barry Bagnato. He was combative on the witness stand and was hurt by his main lawyer's sudden illness.

Lay led Enron's meteoric rise from a staid natural gas pipeline company formed by a 1985 merger to an energy and trading conglomerate that reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 in 2001 and claimed $101 billion in annual revenues. He traveled in the highest business and political circles.

For many years, his corporation was the single biggest contributor to President Bush, who nicknamed him ""Kenny Boy.""",1
818,"The legislative process on Capitol Hill is often slow and grinding. There are committee hearings, filibuster threats and hours of floor debate. But sometimes, when Congress really wants to get something done, it can move blindingly fast.

That's what happened when Congress moved to undo large parts of a popular law known as the STOCK Act last week.

A year ago, President Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act into law at a celebratory ceremony attended by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers.

""I want to thank all the members of Congress who came together and worked to get this done,"" he said.

The law wouldn't just outlaw trading on nonpublic information by members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs. It would greatly expand financial disclosures and make all of the data searchable so insider trading and conflicts of interest would be easier to detect.

But on Monday, when the president signed a bill reversing big pieces of the law, the emailed announcement was one sentence long. There was no fanfare last week either, when the Senate and then the House passed the bill in largely empty chambers using a fast-track procedure known as unanimous consent.

In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., shepherded the bill through. It was Friday afternoon at 12:52. Many members had already left for the weekend or were on their way out. The whole process took only 30 seconds. There was no debate.

""There weren't too many members of Congress who were aware of this legislation,"" says Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. ""And I suspect very, very few understood what a sweeping radical change it is to the STOCK Act.""

Records In The Basement

To understand how the law changed, I asked Holman to meet me in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building.

""This is where the public records are kept, for those who can handle traveling to Washington, D.C.,"" Holman explained.

That's right. If you want to look up the financial disclosure forms filed by high-level congressional staffers â say, to find out whether they've been using the privileges of their positions to make well-timed stock trades â you have to come to this office.

Holman showed me how it works. You have to enter your name and address into a computer, and then you can search. But you have to know the name of the person you are searching for. If he or she has filed a financial disclosure form, it will come up as a PDF, which you can print at a cost of 10 cents a page.

""The database itself is almost meaningless,"" says Holman. He says the only option for those who want to get a comprehensive look at what some 2,900 staffers have filed is to review the cases one by one. ""And that's just too big a job for anybody to do.""

The STOCK Act was supposed to make this task significantly easier. Records for members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs were supposed to be posted online in a searchable, sortable and downloadable format.

If you wanted to see who traded health care stock just before a committee acted on a health care bill, it would be easy. No trips to the basement required.

But there were concerns, especially among the 28,000 executive branch staff who would be required to post their financial disclosures online.

Going Too Far?

""There were particular concerns about risks for those who either travel overseas on government business or work overseas,"" says Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, who represents many of those executive branch employees.

An independent study said there were also risks of identity theft, which she says the new law helps avoid.

""What has been eliminated now is the ability of people to go phishing, if you will,"" she says.

The White House cited the independent report in explaining why the president signed the bill. And a spokesman for Cantor said the House and Senate were simply following recommendations of the study. But Lisa Rosenberg, a lobbyist for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocated for the STOCK Act, says Congress went too far.

""It's really shocking that they used basically the situation of questions about whether some language in the bill was overbroad to just gut the bill â to gut the transparency measures that apply to themselves,"" she says.

Still, two major elements of the law remain. Insider trading is illegal, even for members of Congress and the executive branch. And for those who are covered by the now-narrower law, disclosures of large stock trades are required within 45 days. It will just be harder to get to them.",0
809,"In 1910, undercover agents in New York reportedly thwarted attempts to sell four girls into prostitution. Two of the girls, according to a New York Times story at the time, were only â children of 15 who played with a doll and a teddy bear.â Stories like this one, denouncing the sale of young women and children, typically by foreign immigrants, fueled the white slavery moral panic that spread across United States and Europe in the early 1900s.

Today, historians believe that those stories were significantly inflated and racialized accounts of urban prostitution and sex work. Yet more than a century later, these tales, sometimes apocryphal, have returned with QAnon, the fringe movement that pulls together a collection of conspiracy theories, including the idea that President Trump is fighting a politically connected global sex trafficking ring.

While the problem of sex trafficking is real, QAnon has relied mostly on exaggerated figures and misinformation about the nature of these activities, combining some real cases, like that of financier Jeffrey Epstein, with some blatantly false ones, like an alleged pedophile ring run from the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant (which has no basement).

In many ways, the sensationalist stereotypes of sex trafficking victims promoted by QAnon followers echo the âwhite slaveryâ narratives that spread in U.S. media in the early 1900s. The current proliferation of unrealistic depictions of trafficking victims being kidnapped and â tied up â â frequently by foreigners â obscures the more complex and yet mundane ways in which this crime actually takes place. Instead, human traffickers are more likely family members, intimate partners or trusted adults known to the victims.

More than just obscuring the bigger problem, QAnon threatens to undermine decades of progress made to combat human trafficking. QAnonâs outlandish claims and its attempts to manipulate human trafficking policies for political purposes threaten to erode the international credibility of the U.S. as a global leader in this field and derail the significant progress made in the international fight against human trafficking.",0
97,"Switzerland and Uzbekistan have agreed to the terms under which Bern may return to Tashkent some $131 million seized from the disgraced daughter of former President Islam Karimov. But activists say Uzbekistan does not have institutions to ensure the massive infusion of cash is not looted by regime insiders.

Gulnara Karimova stashed almost $1 billion in Switzerland, funds that prosecutors say were the proceeds from bribes that three foreign mobile operators paid her to receive operating licenses in Uzbekistan. In addition to the $131 million that Bern is prepared to release, about $700 million more is still frozen and could one day be made available to Tashkent under the same conditions.

The memorandum of understanding is not yet legally binding, but it is likely to be celebrated by Tashkent as evidence of President Shavkat Mirziyoyevâs reform agenda.

Dwelling on the corruption of the Karimov era looks like a low-risk proposition for the countryâs current rulers, not least as it serves as another way of emphasizing the purported break with past practices. But the persisting restrictions applied to the work of independent media means that documenting the corruption happening today is still often complicated, if not outright impossible.

The fact that activists are having to demand transparency into how Karimovaâs frozen assets are used, should they ever be returned, and how reluctant the Swiss authorities have been in acceding to Uzbek requests for repatriation of that money, illustrates the continued lack of trust in the governmentâs anti-graft pledges.

Under the terms of the September 11 âframework agreement,â Tashkent will use the restitution transparently and accountably ""to improve the living conditions of the people of Uzbekistan"" and invest ""in projects which support sustainable development"" as defined by the United Nations. The memorandum calls for the ""establishment of a monitoring mechanism"" and says that legally binding agreements are to be negotiated ""in the near future.â

While praising Swiss officials for taking an important step, the Uzbek activists are calling for anti-corruption reforms to be implemented in Uzbekistan before the funds are returned, as well as a number of loopholes in the framework to be closed.

""Unless its proposed potential conditions are very strictly applied, the document will not succeed in preventing the restituted funds being re-appropriated by corrupt government networks,"" warned the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights and other civil society groups in a September 16 letter. ""The agreement requires evidence of further domestic reform given the political and institutional environment in Uzbekistan.""

Karimovaâs fall from grace began even before her father died in September 2016. She was arrested in Tashkent in August 2015 on charges including corruption and tax evasion.

Following a secretive trial, Tashkent regional court in December 2017 sentenced Karimova to 10 years of âlimited freedom,â which in effect meant house arrest. She later pledged to assist in recovering funds said to have been improperly acquired, prompting the court to commute the sentence to five years. In 2019, however, the court ordered Karimova to be moved to prison after finding that she had violated the terms of her house arrest.

In a letter addressed to President Mirziyoyev this past February, Karimova wrote that she was prepared to relinquish claims to $700 million held in frozen Swiss banks accounts in exchange for clemency in her case.

Far from winning her a reprieve, this attempt at negotiation appears to have landed Karimova in only more trouble.

In March, another court found Karimova guilty on multiple counts, including embezzlement and extortion, and sentenced her to 13 years in prison. The sentence is to apply from the date of her first arrest and will be served concurrently with earlier sentences.

Karimova was indicted last year on conspiracy and money laundering charges in New York, where she âstands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,â the Justice Department said in a statement.",1

â Designations Include First Sanctions Against a Madrassa Used to Train Taliban Fighters

WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai (Azmarai), a senior Al-Qaâida official, and Jamia Taleem-Ul-Quran-Wal-Hadith Madrassa, also known as the Ganj Madrassa, a school in Peshawar that serves as a training center and facilitates funding for al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. The activities of the Ganj Madrassa exemplify how terrorist groups, such as al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban, subvert seemingly legitimate institutions, such as religious schools, to divert charitable donations meant for education to support violent acts. Todayâs action is the first designation of a madrassa that is being abused by terrorist organizations. This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan.

âTodayâs action strikes at the heart of the financial and logistical support network that abuses charitable donations and provides essential services for various terrorist groups including al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. These networks provide the fighters, training, and supplies for these terrorist groups to carry out their acts of violence against coalition forces and civilians alike,â said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. âWe will continue to work with our partners around the world to dismantle these terrorist networks, especially those that try to conceal their sinister activities behind critical community organizations like madrassas.â

During his long tenure with al-Qaâida, Azmarai has held a number of important positions. He is al-Qaâidaâs leader in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, Pakistan, and has been a significant financial facilitator for the group, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of its leadership and operations. Azmarai has also acted as a courier for al-Qaâida officials and has managed logistics for family members of senior al-Qaâida leadership, including Usama bin Laden.

Treasury today also designated the Ganj Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is controlled by designated al-Qaâida facilitator Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah. Shaykh Aminullah was designated by both the United States and United Nations (UN) in 2009 for providing material support to al-Qaâida and the Taliban.

The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training center where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalized to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities. In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers. Shaykh Aminullah has directed donations provided for the school to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which use the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan.

The Ganj Madrassa was designated today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorist and their supporters, for being controlled by Shaykh Aminullah and for providing financial and material support to Lashkar-e Tayyiba and the Taliban. Azmarai was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 for acting on behalf of al-Qaâida.

As a result of todayâs designation, any assets these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.

Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai

In addition to his financial activities on behalf of al-Qaâida, Azmarai has been active in multiple other facilitation duties for al-Qaâida. As of early 2012, Azmarai facilitated the procurement of secure areas in Pakistan for al-Qaâida to house militants and store vehicles. Azmarai has frequently acted as a courier within Pakistan for al-Qaâida leaders and other al-Qaâida facilitators. As of early 2003, Azmarai was a courier between al-Qaâida cells in Pakistan and the Persian Gulf and, as of late 2002, was a courier for senior al-Qaâida operational planner Khalid Shaykh Muhammad.

Azmaraiâs facilitation duties on behalf of al-Qaâida have also included providing logistical support to al-Qaâida members and their families. As of 2011, Azmarai assisted al-Qaâidaâs administrative manager with managing the care of important al-Qaâida membersâ families, including facilitating their finances, housing, and medical care. In 1999, Azmarai assisted in making logistical arrangements for al-Qaâida members and their families in Karachi, Pakistan. Azmarai was also specifically responsible for providing support to members of now-deceased al-Qaâida leader Usama bin Ladenâs family. Bin Ladenâs son-in-law selected Azmarai in late 1999 to look after bin Ladenâs family and, in mid-2000, Azmarai began working directly for bin Ladenâs family, facilitating their travel, lodging, and medical needs. From late 2001 through early 2002, Azmarai was responsible for bin Ladenâs family members in Karachi. In mid-2002, Azmarai worked for bin Ladenâs son, now-deceased Saad bin Laden.

Ganj Madrassa

Under Shaykh Aminullahâs leadership, the Ganj Madrassa has trained and harbored Taliban fighters who have subsequently been dispatched to Afghanistan. As recently as early 2013, Shaykh Aminullah was recruiting for Lashkar-e Tayyiba at the Ganj Madrassa and, as of late 2012, was hosting al-Qaâida operatives there.

Shaykh Aminullah has provided assistance, including funding and recruits, to al-Qaida. In addition, he directs donations received by the Ganj Madrassa to jihadist fighters battling coalition forces in Afghanistan and also uses the money to train madrassa students to become Taliban fighters. Shaykh Aminullah frequently travels to the Gulf to obtain charity donations on the madrassaâs behalf.

984,"Globally migrant communities will send nearly US$435 billion to family members in home countries this year. These remittances are vital and sustain not only the livelihoods of the recipients, but also the economies of poor countries.

Recently Westpac, mirroring 2013 steps by Barclays in the UK, became the last big Australian bank to terminate its services to small remitters. This poses a serious risk to the continued, transparent flow of remittances.

Not all Westpac remitter accounts were closed as a group of remitters brought a [legal case](https://www.comcourts.gov.au/file/FEDERAL/P/NSD1222/2014/order_list#;javascript:void(0) against Westpac. This case as well as discussions between the newly organised Australian remittance industry, the banks and the Australian government continue. The lack of real and urgent action however threatens to increase terrorist financing risks.

Moving money  above or below board

Informal, ethnic remittance services  for example, in the form of hawala  are well-developed and often said to pre-date Western banking. These systems shift value across borders without moving physical money. The flow happens through a network of trusted agents, often involving cross-border trade and over and under-invoicing.

Informal remittance systems transfer funds cheaply and efficiently for honest customers. However, the lack of transparency and industry practices also expose them to abuse. Informal remittances are ideal for money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing.

Alongside informal services, formal providers channel money through the banking system. Formal remittance transactions are generally handled by large international companies like Western Union and Moneygram and a host of small service providers. These providers - generally small businesses with ties to ethnic communities - provide affordable and accessible services to ethnic migrant communities. To remit money through the formal financial system, remitters require bank accounts.

From 2001 governments decided to formalise these services and terminate informal remittances. Yet full regulation of remittance services was deemed challenging. Governments settled for basic registration of providers who were required to implement anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) measures.

The AML/CTF compliance burden soon proved too onerous for small remitters, while the registration processes were inadequate to weed out criminal elements and ensure the integrity of registered remitters.

Simultaneously the duty of banks to monitor their customers to prevent criminal transactions was increased, especially in relation to higher-risk customers. Regulators identified remittance businesses as higher-risk customers, thereby requiring banks to spend more money on monitoring their accounts than those of less risky customers. It soon became clear the costs of maintaining these accounts exceeded the income they could generate.

Further pressure was placed on remittance relationships when regulators began to impose superfines on banks for AML/CFT failures. Large international banks began to refuse to deal with smaller banks that could not prove they were adequately managing remittance risks. Targeted law-enforcement action against remitters provided evidence of serious criminal infiltration and collusion by some providers.

For many banks it just made compliance and business sense to exit the small remitter market, thereby undermining the formalisation policy objective.

What now?

Remitter account closures are occurring worldwide and regulators appear unable to prevent it. The most promising development to date was the establishment of a joint government and industry task group in the UK (the Action Group on Cross Border Remittances) to develop, among others, a safe UK-Somalia remittance corridor.

In general, however, regulators have merely called on banks not to engage in wholesale account closure, without taking any steps to change the rules that have led to this response. Given that money service business account closures started in the mid-2000s in the US, the lack of action is disappointing. Regulators have had 10 years to intervene. . The reality is that remittance flows will not stop. Immigrants who need to support vulnerable and often desperate family members abroad will continue to do so. They have no option.

If they cannot afford the more expensive services of the larger, formal providers, they will use informal channels or one of the myriad new online channels. Greater use of these channels will increase terrorist financing risks to society. In addition, the frustration and alienation experienced by members of such communities in Australia and abroad may translate into higher terror risks.

There are therefore compelling reasons to turn this situation around. What can be done?

1) Develop a holistic policy

The remittance debacle constitutes clear policy failure. Initial policy interventions were driven by security concerns. The sense of urgency in 2001 did not allow for sufficient fact-gathering and consultation. A holistic policy that aligns the national security, regulatory and international development goals of government is required.

Cross-border cooperation is also required. Money remitted from Australia is received elsewhere. When the recipient is in Somalia or another developing country where secure identification is not available, Australia will need to cooperate with foreign governments to limit criminal risks.

2) Regulate remittance services appropriately

The amount of money involved and the social impact of remittances demand appropriate regulation, including consumer protection. Governments recognised the need for regulation but were not prepared to do what it takes. They therefore restricted the regulatory focus to AML/CTF aspects only and burdened banks with an uncommercial, quasi-regulatory monitoring function.

This approach has clearly failed. The industry requires a regulator with a broad mandate, one that reflects and balances the interests of the broader industry, providers, customers and society. Industry self-regulation could assist in nurturing the industry but government must shoulder the weight of the regulatory responsibility.

3) Cap transactions by small remitters

The regulatory and supervisory frameworks can be proportionate if a risk-based approach is adopted. The most challenging entities to regulate are the small, independent remitters. One light-touch option is to provide a special minimal compliance regime enabling them to process a limited number of small remittance transactions.

For example, one could impose limits on individual transactions, with a total cap on the value of their monthly remittance business. Such caps are used successfully to reduce the risks posed by mobile money in developing countries. Correctly calibrated caps would align the risk of abuse with the compliance capacity of the business, while facilitating affordable remittance flows.

These are longer-term solutions. In the short term  counted in days and weeks  we need government action to secure banks that are still willing to engage these remitters. Its up to government to devise a scheme that can keep small remittances flowing  and terrorist financing risks contained  until a more appropriate framework is developed. Having created the regulatory conditions for account closures, it is insufficient to merely call on banks not to close these accounts.",0

HSBC's share price has fallen to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations of money laundering.

In 2013 and 2014 the bank allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their scam, leaked secret files show.

HSBC says it has always met its legal duties on reporting such activity.

On Monday in Hong Kong, the shares fell more than 5.3% to close at HK$29.30. In London they fell by a similar amount.

Leaked documents from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world.

Shares in rival banks named in the papers have also been hit. At lunchtime, Standard Chartered and Barclays were down by 5% and 6% respectively, while Germany's Deutsche Bank was down 8%.

The share price falls came against a backdrop of broader negative sentiment on share markets. UK shares were down sharply amid fears of further Covid-related restrictions.

HSBC had been under pressure on multiple fronts before the files were leaked and its shares have taken a particularly hard battering this year, falling by some 50%.

It has been at the sharp end of political pressures in Hong Kong, and from the pandemic fallout.

Although HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from Asia and its shares are important components of both the London and Hong Kong share markets.

Its role in a $80m (Â£62m) fraud is detailed inthe FinCEN leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"".

HSBC moved the money through its US business to HSBC accounts in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014.

The bank says it has always reported such activity in accordance with its legal obligations.

Multiple pressures

HSBC, which is Europe's biggest bank, has set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In August, it reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year - much steeper than analysts had forecast.

It also became embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong and was lambasted by both the US and UK.

Cost-cutting

HSBC is currently pushing ahead with major restructuring of its global banking operations.

Chief executive Noel Quinn, who officially took over in March, said the bank would further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money.

Mr Quinn said HSBC would ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which includes the axing of 35,000 jobs.",1

830,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced legislation on Friday to combat white collar crimes such as insider trading and collusion, the latest in a series of proposals aimed at quelling the demands of continuing protests over inequality.

Pinera shipped several bills to Congress to beef up penalties against colluding to fix prices on sensitive consumer products, while stiffening fines and jail time for financial crimes ranging from fraud to insider trading.

The legislation also provides regulators with more tools to investigate the crimes and establishes new protections for âwhistleblowersâ in both public and private sectors who come forward with evidence of crimes.

âThe immense majority of Chileans want to build a more just, more equal Chile, without abuses or privileges. Thatâs the message we have heard loud and clear from the people,â Pinera said in a speech at the La Moneda presidential palace.

Price fixing and other financial crimes lie at the heart of recent protests over social and economic injustices in Chile that have left at least 31 dead and wrought billions in damages to business.

Since Chileâs return to democracy in 1990, allegations of price fixing have cropped up in markets for items from chicken to diapers, milk, drugs, asphalt and even gynecological visits, outraging many Chileans, who demand changes to the countryâs economic model.

Anger over these abuses appears in graffiti spray-painted on building walls across Santiago, a city of 6 million, and in the signs carried by protesters rebuking such crimes.

âWhen these bills become law, we will have freer, more transparent markets, more competitive companies, products of higher quality and lower prices,â Pinera said.

Chileans will vote on whether to rewrite the countryâs dictatorship-era constitution in April. Many have also called for tougher consumer protections to be worked into a new Magna Carta.

Pinera said on Friday he would soon announce further protections for consumer and worker rights.",0
1015,"The peace negotiations in Libya are accompanied by a deluge of resignations. The Prime Minister of the Tobruk Parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, announced his withdrawal last week. And it was only yesterday that the leader of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Sarraj, joined him and resigned his post in the middle of the peace talks.

Sarraj announced in an interview on state television this Wednesday night that he will ""to hand over the tasks of power to the coming executive authority in a time no later than October"". He also urged the High Council's advisory committee to meet and elect a new Presidential Council.

Sarraj's resignation comes amidst a struggle for internal power within the Government of National Accord (GNA) between the circle of the President of the Council and that of the Interior Minister, Fathi Bashaga. Sarraj himself dismissed Bashaga at the beginning of September and opened an investigation into him because of the violent repression of social protests by one of the militias linked to the ministry of the interior. These sanctions were short-lived, as the minister was released only three days later and returned to his post, from which he controls the security of Tripoli, the headquarters of the GNA.

The search for a substitute prime minister is urgent, as talks resume in Morocco next week to negotiate peace in the Libyan conflict. Sarraj has headed the Government of National Accord since the establishment of the executive in March 2016, together with President Khaled al-Mecrhi, following the failed peace process promoted by the UN in the Moroccan city of Skhirat.

The Libyan country has been divided since the 2011 Arab Spring riots. After the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi, nine years of conflict and divisions have left the Libyan population in a state of anxiety. The energy, economic and health crises are weighing on citizens who have been marching in the streets since August against the two opposing governments.

Libya currently has two governments: the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, and the eastern parliament of Tobruk, created in 2014 and associated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Marshal Khalifa Haftar.

In early September the two sides reached an agreement on the need to agree on ""major commitments"" to end the conflict in Libya, as they announced after the first contact in Bouznika, Morocco. The list of commitments to be followed is not yet known, though the main aim is to secure a definitive ceasefire. The dialogue committees are made up of seven people and will soon announce the first agreements for a peaceful solution in Libya.

The civil war has been raging in the North African country since 2014 and has become an international war scenario involving different foreign powers with different interests on the ground. Haftar's LNA is supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France; meanwhile, the LNA receives military support from Turkey and financial support from Qatar, and has been recognised by the United Nations (UN) since 2016.

Unexpected changes during the peace negotiations

Throughout the week there has been speculation in Libya about the possible resignation of Prime Minister Sarraj. The Bloomerg agency announced two days ago that the leader was considering resigning. No one seemed willing to believe it until yesterday, when Sarraj himself confirmed his resignation during prime-time television.

As a result, the interests and representatives who are leading the peace talks have been turned upside down. The dialogues are in the focus of the international community and currently Russia and Turkey are highly influential in these agreements. For their part, the European Union and the United Nations wish to regain the leadership of the negotiations and, following this resignation, it seems to be more complicated.

As part of this effort, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of the international mission to Libya (UNSMIL) on Tuesday and announced it will fill the vacancy left by its latest special envoy, Ghassam Saleme, in the coming days. Moscow and Cairo support the aspirations of Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognised leader of the executive in eastern Libya and a strong military figure in the country. Following the resignation of the prime minister of the Tobruk parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, both Brussels and the UN are attempting to extol the political figure of Aguilah Saleh Issa, president of the parliament elected in 2014.

The Tobruk Parliament was established in 2014 to replace the Libyan National General Congress after the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi and has control over western Libya.

Libyans no longer want instability

The precarious situation in the country has sparked off the anger of the population. In recent months thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest against both governments. The main demands of the mobilisations are the holding of elections, a social reform package and gas, fuel and running water shortages. Besides, a solution to the energy problem causing constant power cuts in the biggest cities is needed.

In this scenario, Human Right Watch organization has denounced the arbitrary detention of 24 demonstrators in the capital by several armed groups, including a journalist reporting on these protests, beating some of them and using several weapons to disperse the demonstrators. Several armed militias have also been known to take to the streets to clear the marches. The violence escalated until demonstrators in Benghazi stormed and set fire to the East Libyan government headquarters and attacked the city hall. In addition, at least five people have been injured by shots fired by LNA members in the town of Al Marj.

The protests began in Tripoli, Misrata and Zawiyah on August 23, t hanks to a newly formed student movement called Harak Al-Shabab 23/08 that took to the streets to criticise both the eastern and western authorities""for the unbearable living conditions"" in the country.

Both Sarraj and Aguilah Saleh announced a ceasefire commitment a fortnight ago, but it has not been accepted by the military forces on the ground. The opposing armies continue to reinforce and move troops between the oasis of Al Jufrah and the port of Sirte, the new battle front in a war that intensified 14 months ago with the entry of mercenaries-mainly Syrians and Africans-recruited by Turkey and Russia.

Libya has been on the list of failed states since 2011, its population is tired and struggling to get out each day in a country devastated by armed conflict. The civil war is also compounded by the largest refugee crisis on the African continent.

thousands of people cross through the country seeking to reach Europe, most of them are kidnapped by the trafficking mafias and find themselves in detention centres, extorted and forced to work to pay for a ""pass"" to get a plastic boat with no guarantees. The coronavirus crisis has not given Libya's health workers any rest either, as they have not been paid since March. Isolated, with no medical supplies and half of the hospitals destroyed by the armed conflict.",0

In resource rich, commodity-dependent developing nations such as Chile, the issue of trade misinvoicing is not only highly prevalent, but of great negative consequence for public welfare.

Chile ranks on the higher end of the GDP per capita and Human Development Index spectrum of Latin America, though it is still considered a developing country by the International Monetary Fund. And despite low levels of corruption in Chile, trade misinvoicing still occurs.

Trade misinvoicing occurs when individuals or companies intentionally falsify export and/or import invoices, with the ultimate goals ranging from tax evasion to trade-based money laundering.

Several underlying characteristics of the commodity trade in developing countriesâunder-staffed and under-resourced customs departments, lack of proper and sufficient oversight, coupled with state-ownership of many extractive companies and the complex influence of international trade partners â invite opportunities for trade misinvoicing as well as rent-seeking by public officials.

In Chile, these conditions play out in the nationâs dominant industry: the copper business. The Chilean Copper Commission reported that in 2018, copper constituted 48.2% of Chileâs total exports, with the larger, umbrella category of minerals totaling 55.8% and US$42.1 billion. The economic importance and susceptibility of Chileâs most crucial natural resource industry to misinvoicing urges scrutiny.

As disclosed in Global Financial Integrityâs report, âTrade-Related Illicit Financial Flows in 135 Developing Countries: 2008-2017,â Chile clocked in with a $14.5 billion value gap in trade with all global partners in 2017. GFI calculates this value gap, or the difference between values of imports and exports between partner nations, through analysis of each countryâs reported trade data. This means there is $14.5 billion unaccounted for in trade records between Chile and its partners.

Other studies have pointed specifically to the vulnerability of the copper industry. A 2016 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) publication concluded that there was widespread copper export overinvoicing in Chile, particularly with some of its largest trade partners such as Japan, China, and the Netherlands.

A subsequent case study of the same industry published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) showed chronic export underinvoicing, especially in trade with China. The difficulty pinpointing the direction of misinvoicing from national data and the consequent contradictions in reports is why GFI uses the value gap terminology, which takes only the absolute difference. Nonetheless, there are certainly irregularities in Chileâs trade, as the table below shows.

The ECLAC linked the majority of the export underinvoicing in their study to a deal between Chileâs state-owned copper corporation, CODELCO, and a state-owned Chinese metal and mineral company, China Minmetals Corporation. In 2006, in return for a Minmetals investment of $550 million in the development of the Gaby mine in northern Chile, CODELCO agreed to supply Minmetals with copper for 15 years at a rate below the market copper price.

But in 2016, questioning of CODELCO by the Chilean tax authority on issues of tax evasion and structure caused CODELCO to pull out of Copper Partners Investment Ltd., the Bermuda-located joint venture created between CODELCO and Minmetals. Concerns arose about the nature of the CODELCO and Minmetals deal, chiefly regarding the motivations behind selling to a foreign company at such a loss to Chile.

Foreign investors like Minmetals were taxed at a rate of 35% to 42% under Chileâs Decreto Ley 600 of 1974, while state-owned companies such as CODELCO paid additional public entity taxes. Therefore, there were many potential incentives for domestic companies to underinvoice their exports and set up tax-haven ventures with foreign investors that could be used to facilitate transfer pricing.

The CODELCO-Minmetals situation is far from explicitly suspicious, but it both introduces the level of skepticism needed in examining Chileâs copper industry and illuminates the complexity of trade misinvoicing as a tool for facilitating illicit financial flows. Other cases in Chile, like a recent one in which 83 tons of stolen copper cable would have been exported to China with falsified invoices, emphasize these points.

Additional cases and scandals encompass the intricacies of trade and misinvoicing in Chile. Past presidential candidate Marco EnrÃ­quez-Ominami and ex-advisor CristiÃ¡n Wagner were accused of falsifying invoices in conjunction with the high-profile, international OAS company scandal; the Milicogate embezzlement case in which Chilean military officers were investigated for allegedly falsifying invoices totaling $200 million and implicating domestic, Israeli, and US companies, made all the more complicated by the funding of the military by state-owned copper; and even cases of distributors smuggling or falsifying invoices to get cigarettes into and out of Chile while evading taxes totaling up to$57 million, emphasize that tax evasion is a big motivator behind illicit trade.

Smaller criminal cases show that trade-based money laundering in Chile often is used to obscure drug trafficking: in Caso Pilar del Norte, a fruit import/export business was allegedly used to launder drug proceeds between Mexico and Chile; similarly, in Caso Yaupel, a fruit importer and distributor reportedly laundered money digitally between Colombia, Germany, Ecuador and Chile. In a related case, Caso el Hermano de Yaupel, the importerâs brother expanded the trade-based money laundering scheme into Hungary, Panama, and the Netherlands. Other cases range from embezzlement, human trafficking and the drug trade across Latin America and other global partners.

Manuel Melero, President of Chileâs National Chamber of Commerce, said âas an Observatory of Illicit Commerce we are deeply concerned with the effects of the organized crime that is behind smuggling and counterfeiting.â

As these cases illustrate, the issue of trade misinvoicing in Chile is not simply a matter of lost revenue, but a matter of governance, transnational security, and public welfare.",1
858,"Vividly portrayed in films from The Godfather to The Sweeney, the idea of criminal enforcement using threats, intimidation, assault and murder has long been an established underworld practice.

Despite the widespread cultural fascination with this shadowy part of society, there is little in the way of academic work that explores the role of enforcers.

My latest research with colleagues from Scotland and the US consisted of interviewing underworld figures from two parts of the UK â the West Scotland and the West Midlands, to further explore the nature and extent of this phenomenon.

In popular culture, the criminal enforcer conjures up images of machismo, allure, brute force and professionalism. In the fictional world, enforcement activities like debt collecting or extortion seemingly take place within the night-time economy, in pubs, clubs and casinos.

Also in media portrayals in news and on television, the preferred mode of communication seems to be violence â a constant presence in organised crime. My previous research on organised crime argues that violence can be used strategically by a crime outfit to start, maintain or advance a criminal enterprise. But to what extent is this the case for enforcement out on the streets of our towns and cities?

Becoming an enforcer

The West of Scotland and West Midlands have long histories of organised crime â both places are major hubs for illicit drugs. Through a comparative study we gained extensive insights into a number of areas including how people become enforcers; how contact is made between all parties involved; the costing arrangements; and the degree of planning involved.

In the study, a criminal enforcer was defined as any member or associate of a criminal organisation who acts illegally to achieve his ends. Essentially the enforcer is someone who settles a dispute to get âjusticeâ for his employer, such as a debt that is owed.

Itâs 100% social. You need to have that name. Everybody needs to know that youâre the person who collects the debts. Often, you gain that criminal reputation and respect from the work that youâve put in, the prison time that youâve done.

This was a response from John, an ex-military private investigator, when asked whether strong social connections are required to be a successful enforcer. Social capital, according to John, underscores the saying: âItâs not what you know, itâs who you knowâ. So this view is not exclusive to the legitimate world and makes clear the importance of being known and being seen on the streets when it comes to underworld enterprises.

The economics of enforcement

Researchers who have explored the economics of crime and punishment tend to examine how offenders calculate things: the practicalities and money offered by a legal income; the income potential of illicit methods; the probability of being arrested for criminal behaviour and the likely punishment if convicted.

Aaron, who has previously worked as a debt collector for several crime groups, alludes to the good money that is associated with enforcement:

â¦ Sometimes the lender will tell you to get back his money and you will get a percentage. Iâve been involved in situations where individuals have had to pay back the money with interest. In these cases Iâve been told by the lender to take a percentage from the money heâs owed and whatever else heâs charged on top.

Interestingly, Aaron did not seem to factor in the probability of being arrested in his calculations. This should not be mistaken for foolishness, as enforcers are rational and sophisticated in their planning and carrying out of illegal work.

Planning and acting

Popular culture often portrays enforcement as a physically violent endeavour. According to Theo, a convicted offender, violence is not necessarily good for business:

Iâve been part of situations where itâs been a âcriminal figureâ who dealt with a legitimate company that owed him moneyâ¦ I didnât go in with tools [weapons]. Itâs because I was dealing with normal nine-to-five people, who would happily call the policeâ¦ Youâre better off reasoning with them and having a conversation.

Theoâs approach to violence is dependent on the circumstances of the debtor. Enforcement, in relation to debt collecting, is not a process that is exclusive to underworld operatives. His approach of âreasoningâ with normal everyday people (as opposed to other criminals) implies logic, which is much needed when retrieving owed money.

Overall, our study suggests that nuanced enforcement practices is an alternative form of criminal justice that is woven into the fabric of any provision of illicit goods or services. Yet, it is a criminal activity that is overlooked in national debates due to limited academic research.

Certain kinds of occupation often facilitate criminal behaviour like enforcing, such as a military background. Future research would help establish potential links between previous occupations and becoming involved in the enforcer business for organised crime, whether using lethal or non-lethal approaches. Clearly there is nuance there that is rarely explored in popular police and mafia dramas.",0
723,"ThetaRay, a leading provider of AI-based Big Data analytics, has signed an agreement under which Banco Santander will employ ThetaRayâs anti-money laundering (AML) solution for correspondent banking.

The system will analyze SWIFT traffic, risk indicators and Know Your Customer (KYC) data to detect anomalies indicating money laundering schemes in correspondent banking transactions. The rollout of the solution started in Q4 2019 and will be globally implemented over the next months.

Through the partnership, Santander will utilize a version of ThetaRayâs Investigation Center uniquely designed for correspondent banking. The platform will provide Santander full access to their data lineage, enabling them to perform full investigative forensics, as well as trace how and why the algorithms came to a certain decision.

âThetaRayâs solution will further improve our ability to detect the earliest signs of money laundering and uncover unknown originating risks, â said Carlos Gutierrez, Global VP Global Transaction Banking CIB, Santander.

âWe are satisfied to work with Thetaray.

962,"Intelligence  artificial or real  is only as good as the information it uses. Location intelligence helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. How can location intelligence be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives to help combat financial crime?

Introduction

Intelligence (artificial or real) is only as good as the information it uses. A higher volume of relevant information provides deeper context to a situation, resulting in heightened intelligence, increased value, and better outcomes.

Location intelligence is a data asset that helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. This post considers how location intelligence can be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives, specifically fraud examination and forensic audit, to combat financial crime.

Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit

Fraud examination is the discipline of resolving allegations of fraud from tips, complaints, or accounting clues. It involves obtaining documentary evidence, interviewing witnesses and potential suspects, writing investigative reports, testifying to findings, and assisting in the general detection and prevention of fraud *.

Forensic audit is the process of investigation used to build a case that supports fraud examination. It is the intersection of financial principles and the law, and therefore, applies the following:

Technical skills of accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, and certain areas of the law and research;
Investigative skills for the collection, analysis and evaluation of evidential matter; and
Critical thinking to interpret and communicate the results of an investigation.

Points 2 and 3, above, are particularly relevant to this post. The collection and analysis of evidential matter needs a variety of data assets to support a comprehensive investigation. Critical thinking  sometimes referred to as lateral thinking, or thinking outside the box  is a disciplined approach to problem solving and guides our thought process and related actions. Critical thinking is required to contextualize patterns and connections across evidential matter.

Location Intelligence Is Context

Think about where you are right now. You may be at a specific address. If you have location services enabled on your phone, you are also located at specific coordinates relative to the rest of the world. However, the intelligence of your location is more than that.

The neighborhood that you are in can be characterized by demographics and consumer preferences. It also can be described in relation to the proximity of other neighborhoods that may have similar or very different characteristics. The people around you have mobile devices that are interacting with social media, streaming a live event, or making a purchase. Video is capturing movement, and machine sensors are analyzing usage and scheduling maintenance.

Location intelligence applies the multiple layers of information that surround you. The better you are able to logically connect these layers of information, the more location intelligence you have.

Back to Evidential Matter

Location intelligence continues to grow as a critical component of analytics, and it is being applied to more and more scenarios across industries through social media, connected devices, distributed systems, the internet of everything, and overlaying all of that with just about any dataset that can be collected.

In financial services, location intelligence provides an important and actionable level of information that ties together a customer profile, from on-boarding to know-your-customer and financial crime investigations. Referring back to Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit, above, location intelligence can be a critical component of evidential matter.

A Scenario

Party A is a bank customer that, by all accounts, is squeaky clean.
Party A executes a financial transaction with Party B from a place Party A has never been to before.
Party B registered their place of business as being in an upscale business park, but a satellite view shows that the actual location is in an abandoned industrial area.
Party B makes many transactions with Party C that very closely correlates to the sum that was originally sent from Party A.
Party C is located in very close proximity to a HIFCA designated zone. [To get a sense of what proximity risk is, look at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) and High Intensity Financial Crime Area (HIFCA).]

Should Party A be investigated? It is a questionable circumstance, at least.

As it relates to forensic audit, location intelligence provides additional layers of information that tighten the interrelationship among auditing, fraud examination and financial forensics in a dynamic way that adapts to political, social, and cultural pressures over time.

Summary

Fraud examination and forensic audit encompasses much more than just the review of financial data; it also involves techniques such as interviews, statement analyses, public records searches, and forensic document examination to identify questionable circumstances.

Location intelligence can help identify transaction anomalies more quickly, verify customer place of business visually and more efficiently, and flag sensitive cross-border conditions and proximity risk. All of these are vital in securing the proper documentation needed in a robust forensic examination.

*Notes:

The organizations obligation is to report suspicious activity, not to stop it, by submitting a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report). There are two levels to this:

Level 1 - The Sniff Test: A questionable activity or a correlation of circumstances is identified (Something seems fishy here).
Level 2 - Investigation: A disproportionate amount of time can be spent manually collecting supporting documentation. A good set of data access tools that links relevant data points, including location intelligence, can optimize this process, making it faster and with better quality.",0
352,"Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a âsyndicated criminal mafiaâ meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Policeâs revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;

571 Zengeza Township;

9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);

Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and

431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.

Four vehicles are also listed under assets that need explanation. Two combine harvesters, six tractors, two planters, three motorbikes and a boom spray were found at Chihuriâs farms at Shamva and Darwendale.",1

The heir to the Nina Ricci perfume and fashion fortune has been convicted of tax fraud by a Paris court after hiding millions in an offshore HSBC account.

Arlette Ricci, 73, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay a â¬1 million (Â£720,000;$1.1m) fine.

The court also confiscated two properties worth four million euros (Â£2.9m;$4.2m).

HSBC's Swiss private banking arm is being investigated after a leak revealed large scale tax fraud.

Ms Ricci, who can appeal, was given a two-year suspended sentence on top of her one-year custodial sentence.

Her daughter, Margot Vignat, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Ms Ricci was accused of hiding millions of euros from the French authorities to evade tax using an offshore HSBC account.

She was ordered by the court to pay millions in back taxes for the period of 2007-2009, with the exact amount to be set at a later date.

Ms Ricci's lawyer, Jean-Marc Fedida, claimed his client had been made an example of, calling her sentence ""extremely severe"".

Mr Fedida said he may ask the judge to let Ms Ricci serve the sentence under lenient conditions, such as partial liberty or wearing an electronic tag.

But telephone recordings quoted in court apparently showed that the perfume heiress was aware she was breaking the law.

In one phone conversation, she said, laughing, ""I believe I did the right thing and I never heard from Bercy so all is well,"" referring to the French finance ministry.

""Yes, inevitably, necessarily because all that is illegal anyway,"" she said.

'Unacceptable' practices

Ms Ricci, who has consistently denied the accusations against her, will now have to decide whether to appeal against her conviction.

She was the first of around 50 French nationals to face trial over tax evasion in the HSBC case. Her prosecution was seen as a test case for the so-called ""Swissleaks"" scandal.

A list of thousands of HSBC's clients was passed to the French government in 2009 by whistleblower Herve Falciani, a former employee of the bank's private operation in Switzerland.

But the bank's tax-evasion practices didn't come to light until the documents were reported by the BBC's Panorama programme and a host of other international media outlets in 2015.

Widespread media coverage led to criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina but not in the UK, where HSBC is based.

The UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted.",1

Reports of the Central Vigilance Commission, in-charge of investigation of the CWG scam, revealed that Suresh Kalmadi, the Chairman of the organising committee of the Games, offered a contract of Rs 141 crore to Swiss Timings for its timing equipment which was unnecessarily high by Rs 95 crore. All the accused, including Kalmadi, were charged of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery for purpose of cheating and were also charged under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

772,"In an attack on French President Emmanuel Macronâs defense of the right to show cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which many Muslims consider disrespectful and blasphemous, Iran's supreme leader has equated Holocaust denial with perceived insults against Islam's prophet.

The remarks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei resulted in renewed calls on Twitter to add a warning label to Khameneiâs tweets or remove his account, with some saying Iranâs top authority should not be allowed to spread ""anti-Semitism"" on social-media networks.

Khameneiâs October 28 comments addressed to âYoung French Peopleâ were posted in Persian, French, and English on his website, as well as on social-media sites including Twitter.

In the short message, the Iranian leader said Macronâs move was a âstupid act.â

Macron has defended secular values following the killing of 47-year-old schoolteacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in his classroom after allowing any students who might be offended to leave.

Macron has paid tribute to Paty, saying he was ""killed because he was teaching students about freedom of speech, the freedom to believe and to not believe.""
âAsk your president why he supports insulting Godâs Messenger in the name of freedom of expression. Does freedom of expression mean insulting, especially a sacred personage?â Khamenei asked. âIsnât this stupid act an insult to the reason of the [people] who elected him?â he added.

Khamenei then compared insults against the Prophet Muhammad with Holocaust denial, which is banned in some countries, including Germany.

âWhy is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust? Why should anyone who writes about such doubts be imprisoned while insulting the Prophet (pbuh) is allowed?â

Khameneiâs tweets were met with criticism, including by Jonathan Greensblatt, the national director and chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who said, âHolocaust denialism is hate, pure & simple.â

âWhy is Khamenei allowed to consistently espouse anti-Semitism that clearly violates Twitter policy on hate speech?â added Greensblatt, who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor who escaped Nazi Germany.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center also blasted Khameneiâs tweet, saying, âNo Ayatollah, the real question is why @Twitter gives you a free pass to use their platform to push your genocidal threats of Final Solution against the worldâs largest Jewish community -- the Democratic State of Israel?â

Khameneiâs tweets coincided with a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, as well as the chief executives of Facebook and Google, were questioned on issues dealing with free speech and content moderation.

At the hearing, Dorsey was asked by Republican senators why tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump have been flagged for containing âmisleading or potentially harmful informationâ but controversial tweets by other world leaders and dictators have been not been met with action.

Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker specifically asked Dorsey about four tweets by Khamenei which, he said, glorified violence. They included a tweet posted in May that said: ""We will support and assist any nation or any group anywhere who opposes and fights the Zionist regime, and we do not hesitate to say this.""

Iranian officials refer to Israel as the Zionist regime. The Islamic republic, home to the Middle Eastâs largest population of Jews outside of Israel, does not recognize Israel.

âWe did not find those to violate our terms of service because we consider them saber-rattling, which is part of the speech of world leaders in concert with other countries,â Dorsey responded.

âSpeech against our own people or a countryâs own citizens we believe is different and can cause more immediate harm,â Dorsey added.

In 2019, Khameneiâs Twitter account was temporarily banned for reiterating a fatwa issued by the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, against author Salman Rushdie.

âImam Khomeiniâs verdict regarding Salman Rushdie is based on divine verses and just like divine verses, it is solid and irrevocable,â the tweet posted by @Khamenei_ir had said.

A Twitter spokesman said then that the tweet violated the platformâs rules.

âItâs against our rules to make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people,â the spokesman said then.

Khameneiâs Twitter account was reactivated after the tweet's removal.

In the past, some critics have suggested that Khamenei and other Iranian officials should not be allowed to use Twitter as long as it remains blocked inside the country.

Others say Twitter is one of the few platforms where Iranians can challenge and criticize comments by their leaders, including Khamenei, criticism of whom is considered a red line in Iran that has landed many in prison.

One such reaction came on October 28 from former political prisoner Zia Nabavi, who spent nearly nine years in prison after being arrested following the disputed 2009 presidential election and a brutal state crackdown that followed.

âYou cannot give guidance on freedom of expression in France when your [own] criticism in your country can result in two years in prison,â Nabavi said, without naming Khamenei.",0
1040,"COLUMBUS (AP)  Any potential comeback by ex-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder wont go unchallenged.

The once-powerful Republican said last week that unfinished business on policy matters has him considering a return run for the district including his Perry County home.

In a district where the winner of the Republican primary will almost certainly land the seat, a three-way GOP primary is shaping up. Coshocton City Council President Cliff Biggers is already running and a second GOP contender, local businessman Randal Almendinger, is circulating petitions.

Both Almendinger and Householder have until Dec. 16 to file.

High interest in the seat shows top Republicans arent clearing the way for Householders victory. Supporters have said Householder would bring valuable skill and experience to the Statehouse, but his detractors say he led an era of heavy-handed politics that shouldnt be repeated.

Householder, 56, left Columbus a decade ago amid a federal investigation into allegations of money laundering and irregular campaign practices.

An anonymous, nine-page memo leaked to the FBI, IRS and then-Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in 2004 accused the House Republican Campaign Committee that Householder oversaw of overpaying vendors, then having those vendors make secret payments back to Householder and his advisers.

Householder said at the time the memo contained half-truths and outright lies. After a two-year investigation, the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute.

If he runs, Householder would join a group of seasoned Republican lawmakers seeking to return to the House next year. They include Senate President Keith Faber and state Sens. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, Tom Patton of Cleveland, Jim Hughes of Columbus and possibly Chris Widener of Springfield.

All served under Householder when he was speaker, potentially giving him critical mass to seek another speakership. Householder insists hes not going for the job.

He is, however, working to line up support for getting back to the Statehouse. Powerful retired lobbyist John Mahaney, of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said he supports the effort.

Larry is a very hard-working, loyal guy. I thought he did a nice job as speaker, he said. His staff didnt do him any favors, but he himself certainly was four-square with me. His word was his bond, as I prided myself at having mine be over the years. Also, were a couple of hillbillies  him from Glenford, me from Zanesville  so we got along.

Mahaney noted some storied Ohio politicians  including late Republican Gov. James Rhodes and the late Democratic House Speaker Vern Riffe  hailed from Appalachia. But the district Householder is eyeing has been redrawn to be more urban and less rural since Householder last served, so its unclear whether it would be so easy to win.

Biggers, who is black, may attract campaign and financial help from his party since he would lend some desired diversity to the nearly all-white House Republican caucus. He is a retired police detective and pastor of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Coshocton.

Almendinger is a Republican party insider well-known in Licking County, where he owns newspapers, a commercial cleaning company and a real estate company and has served in public roles including school board and township trustee.

Householder has served as Perry County commissioner and auditor. He was speaker from 2001 to 2004.",0
24,"A group of fraudsters from the East of England who conned more than 50 people out of millions of pounds were today (26 April 2019) sentenced to a combined total of 21 years in prison at Southwark Crown Court.

The group ran a âboiler roomâ scam from 2014 to 2016, convincing elderly and vulnerable people to invest in fake companies. Some people were scammed more than once and one 83-year-old lost over Â£1m.

After a number of concerned victims contacted police, an investigation was launched by the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU). Forensic Analytics provided expert witness testimony on behalf of the prosecution.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk was jailed for six years and Muhammad Tanveer, 30, from Romford, received a seven year sentence. Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington and Ryan Weston from Wisbech, were jailed for four years and three years respectively. Accomplices Lucy Richardson, 25, Mandy Cross, 59, from Oprington, Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay and Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk all received suspended sentences.

A âboiler roomâ fraud sees criminals cold calling or emailing their victims pretending to be from an established and legitimate company to persuade them to invest in worthless or non-existent stocks, often using high pressure sales tactics.

Detective Chief Inspector Liz Fernandes, who led the investigation, said:âThese ruthless criminals conned many innocent people out of money they had worked hard for throughout their careers, tricking them into investing into non-existent companies and stocks. The sentences handed out today can never make up for the traumatic impact this has had on the lives of the victims, but we hope that it has brought them some closure. This was an incredibly lengthy and complex investigation and our officers have worked tirelessly in bringing these offenders to justice and ensuring they will remain behind bars for a considerable amount of time.â",1
586,"(CNN) The University of California improperly admitted dozens of students based on their personal or family connections to donors and university staff, the state auditor announced Tuesday.

The audit conducted on the University of California's admissions process found UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara unfairly admitted a total of 64 applicants between 2013 and 2019.

""By admitting 64 noncompetitive applicants, the university undermined the fairness and integrity of its admissions process and deprived more qualified students of the opportunity for admission,"" California State Auditor Elaine Howle said in a statement. ""The university has also failed to ensure that campuses fairly and consistently treat the thousands of prospective students who apply each year.""

In response to the audit, University of California President Michael Drake said the university system is ""committed to safeguarding the integrity of its admissions practices"" and will take prompt action to address the issues raised in auditor's report.

""I have zero tolerance on matters of integrity and will do everything I can to ensure inappropriate admissions do not happen on any of our campuses,"" Drake said. ""I sincerely appreciate the time and resources the State Auditor's office has committed to helping us improve and strengthen our admissions policies and processes.""

The audit findings come more than a year after several wealthy parents were arrested on charges of money laundering as part of the college admissions scandal dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues,"" which alleged that the parents used wealth and connections to have their children admitted to universities through means including cheating on standardized tests and bribing coaches to grant them entrance for sports they did not play.

Actress Lori Loughlin was recently sentenced to two months in federal prison for her role in this particular scheme that helped her daughters gain admission into the University of Southern California.

The University of California campuses admitted 22 of the 64 students through their student-athlete admissions processes, even though the students did not have the athletic qualifications to compete at the universities, Howle said. UC Berkley unfairly admitted 42 who were connected to staff and donors.

The report released Tuesday said these applicants were less qualified than many others for whom the campus denied admission. ""In fact, some of these applicants received the lowest possible scores on their applications,"" the report said.

Neither UC Berkeley nor UCLA have developed methodologies for how they determine which applicants to admit, according to the audit.

And inadequate training and monitoring of the staff who review applications at those schools, as well as UC San Diego, also unfairly affected applicants' chances of admission, the audit said.

""We found that staff were sometimes overly strict or overly lenient in their review of applications, thereby making the applicants' chances of admission unduly dependent on the individual staff who rated them rather than on the students' qualifications,"" Howle said.

These practices are continuing due to a lack of adequate oversight of campuses' admissions processes, the auditor said. She called for stronger standards to guarantee fairness and to detect and prevent inappropriate admissions decisions moving forward.

The auditor recommended that the office of the university system president require all campuses to verify the athletic talents of prospective student athletes and review donation records for indicators of inappropriate activity before they are admitted.

""Instead of this independent verification, the campuses largely relied on coaches' assertions that prospective student athletes were athletically qualified,"" Howle said.",1
608,"(Yicai Global) April 29 -- Pinduoduo reported 18 criminal cases to the authorities since the start of the year, with 28 people detained by police, a news outlet under the Peoples Daily reported today, citing a statement from the Chinese e-commerce platform. Of the 28, three staffers were arrested, while the company fired six others.

In China, public security organs can take three other measures in addition to detention and arrest. First, criminal suspects and defendants who have not been detained or arrested can be questioned at designated locations. Second, they must provide a guarantor or pay bail to ensure they dont evade or obstruct the investigation, prosecution or trial. And third, the suspects are put under home surveillance.

The head of the Pinduoduos integrity and legal affairs division, whose name was not revealed, said that the company has always adopted a zero-tolerance attitude toward employees involved in commercial bribery.
Sellers and suppliers who bribe or try to bribe its staff, as well as platform businesses that collude with criminal gangs to make counterfeit and substandard products, or are involved in overseas gambling and money laundering, or other illegal acts will be kicked off the platform, the official added.

Pinduoduo called on Chinas major internet platforms to set up an anti-commercial bribery alliance to share databases of former employees and suppliers suspected of law-breaking to maintain an honest society, as advocated by the government.

Another Chinese internet firm Meituan Dianping said yesterday that it has dealt with 12 criminal cases since January, with 33 people handed over to the authorities.

Chinas internet companies have been pushing ahead with anti-corruption efforts in recent years amid the failure of corporate governance and internal staff building to keep up with their rapid expansion. In January to July last year, eight firms reported more than 110 cases involving over 220 people, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported. Both figures were more than 11 times those of 2015.",1
838,"New Delhi, Nov 2 (PTI) Union minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said the government has âwalked the talkâ in its fight against corruption and the social esteem of being incorruptible has been seen in Indian society, according to an official statement.

Addressing an event here, he said the celebration of the Vigilance Awareness Week (from October 27 to November 2) is a reiteration of the governmentâs resolve to continue the crusade against corruption.

Singh also administered the integrity pledge to the officials of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and addressed the officials.

On this occasion, he launched the DARPGâs âIdeas Box on Good Governance Practices in a Pandemicâ and released social media tweets on the âBest Practices in e-governanceâ, the statement said.

The Ideas Box for crowd sourcing of ideas has been operationalised both on the DARPG as well as on the MyGov platform, it said.

Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said in 2014, there was an atmosphere of despair and disillusionment and the common man felt that there is no redemption to the cycle of corruption.

The Modi government has successfully transformed the then pervading pessimism to optimism, he said.

In pursuance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs mantra of âZero Tolerance to Corruptionâ, a number of decisive steps have been taken by the government to combat corruption, the minister said.

The Prevention of Corruption Act was amended after a gap of 30 years to make the processes more equitable and reduce opportunities for corruption, he said.

âSingh said the government has walked the talk in its fight against corruption and the social esteem of being incorruptible has been seen in Indian society,â said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.

A round table discussion on the theme âSatark Bharat, Samriddh Bharat (Vigilant India, Prosperous India)â was also held by the Department keeping in line with the activities for the occasion, it said.

The round table was addressed by former Cabinet secretaries Prabhat Kumar and Ajit Seth, former secretary Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) C Chandramouli and Secretary DARPG K Shivaji.

The round table discussion focused on key issues of preventive vigilance in the pursuit of âNaitik Bharatâ which included training in ethics of public service, social audit of ethical practices, development of measurable metrics for corruption and disproportionately high impact corruption has on governance, the statement said.

The lead discussants emphasised the need for ethics being the cornerstone of public service, importance of awareness generation in preventive vigilance, role of chief vigilance officers, adoption of integrity pacts and online portal probity and the amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act, it said.

758,"Foreign prosecutors are increasingly asking the UK for help in tax crime investigations, new figures suggest.

According to research by Thomson Reuters, the number of information requests relating to tax offences received by the UK government rose 44% last year; from 103 in 2017 to 148 in 2018.

Requests to the government require businesses or individuals to provide documents, such as transaction histories or bank statements, within a certain time period. They can also require people to give evidence in court.

The increase in the number of requests reflects growing cooperation between international law enforcement agencies. According to Thomson Reuters, tax offences are increasingly cross-border, making it harder to gather evidence necessary for prosecution and prompting greater collaboration between countries.

Brian Peccarelli, chief operating officer at Thomson Reuters, said: âTax authorities globally are increasingly working together to stamp out tax evasion. Deeply integrated economies and lengthy supply chains mean investigating tax offences can be very difficult without collaboration. Information sharing networks can therefore be very important in increasing the chances of locating the offenders.â

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development has announced proposals aimed at reducing corporate tax avoidance and evasion. The proposals would see an increase in the rights of countries to levy tax on corporate income earned from sales in their jurisdictions, regardless of which jurisdiction those profits are actually recorded in.",0
719,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday told citizens not to fear a new anti-terrorism law, addressing for the first time the controversial legislation that has unnerved rights groups over potential violations of civil liberties.

The mercurial leader last week signed the anti-terrorism bill, prompting rights groups to stage protests and lawyers to question the law before the Supreme Court.

âFor the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist,â he said in a televised national address mainly to update Filipinos on the coronavirus outbreak.

Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation have nothing to fear, Duterte said, adding that communists are among the terrorists.

The conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party has raged for half a century and killed more than 40,000 people. In the volatile south, the Philippines faces piracy, kidnappings and extremism by groups influenced by Islamic State, who occupied a southern city in 2017 and are now increasingly carrying out suicide bombings.

The new law creates an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president, which can tag individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. It also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Local and international human rights groups had said that while the Philippines does have clear security threats, the legislation could be abused to target administration opponents and suppress peaceful dissent.",0
903,"A corruption scandal is in the news in Ghana again. Media reports suggest an elaborate scheme of cronyism in the procurement of private sector involvement in the countryâs energy industry. This is only the latest of many allegations of serious corruption in the country.

Annual reports by the Auditor General and disclosures from undercover investigations provide evidence of widespread corruption across Ghanaian society. The latest Afrobarometer survey also showed that 33% of the Ghanaians surveyed reported paying bribes to public officials. This is lower than the rates for Nigeria (44%) and Liberia (53%), but much higher than Senegal (15%).

And according to the countryâs Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, Ghana loses $US3bn every year to corruption. Beyond economic costs, corruption erodes confidence in democratic institutions, undermines the rule of law and violates human rights.

It was in this context that our study sought to understand how young educated adults â described in our study as prospective elites â reacted to corrupt opportunities.

What constitutes corruption?

Corruption is a complex social problem. It takes different forms in different societies, and it changes over time. A widely-cited definition comes from Transparency International: corruption is âthe abuse of entrusted power for private gainâ. This is helpful, but I prefer the definition by the criminologist John Kleinig, who wrote that officials:

act corruptly when, in exercising or failing to exercise their authority, they act with the primary intention of furthering private or departmental/divisional advantage.

This definition makes the point that corruption includes both what people do and what they fail to do. The critical issue is a personâs motive. It also makes clear that corrupt officials need not benefit from the transaction: sometimes officials abuse their authority for the benefit of groups to which they belong. Examples would include a religious group, an ethnic group or a political party.

The definition also takes us beyond monetary gains to include other gains such as esteem, especially in cases of nepotism and cronyism.

More recently, I have become interested in what some describe as âdelayed corruptionâ. Here officials exercise their authority with an eye on personal advantage that will accrue to them once they leave public office.

The why

We first sought to determine the type of corruption that the young adults were likely to engage in. We presented 530 with scenarios depicting various forms of corrupt opportunities, and asked what they would do in such cases.

In explaining why people resorted to corruption, we considered bribery and nepotism across three situations: policing; public procurement; and the abuse of power for the benefit of others rather than the young adults themselves. A number of important findings emerged.

We found that people were more inclined to engage in influence peddling â with and on behalf of friends and relatives â rather than to pay bribes directly. For example, nearly 50% indicated they would ask friends to use their positions to award them a government contract while only a third said they would pay a bribe for a similar contract.

This suggests that friendship and kinship networks, rather than direct monetary exchange, are important channels through which corrupt exchanges take place.

We also found that perceptions of being found out â in other words, risk factors â played a big role. This is consistent with research findings from elsewhere showing that corruption is more likely to happen in environments where there is weak monitoring and the risk of detection is low.

We also found that young adults who defined a successful life in terms of material possessions were consistently more inclined to engage in bribery and nepotism. They were willing to pay bribes or use friendship networks to secure public contracts, to influence police officers, and to make decisions that favoured others.

Finally, we found that a personâs attachments to the state and to kinship groups mattered a great deal for their decision to resort to corruption. A strong attachment to the state made corrupt conduct less likely; a strong attachment to kinship groups made it more likely.

What needs to be done

Anti-corruption efforts need to focus on improving the detection of corrupt transactions â whether these are bribery or nepotism and cronyism â because it is certainty of detection that deters criminal conduct. Research evidence also shows perceptions of certainty increase peopleâs willingness to report corruption to the authorities.

Three things can be considered.

First, the anti-corruption architecture could be redesigned to grant the police a pivotal role. The police have the capacity to build an extensive intelligence network across the country. They are present in every city and their intelligence networks can help detect efforts to hide wealth obtained through corruption. They also provide easy access for citizens to report corruption. But an anti-corruption role for the police requires improved training, better resources, and insulating them from partisan politics.

Second, invert the logic underpinning efforts to detect procurement corruption. Currently, it is presumed that procurement transactions are âcleanâ until evidence of corruption emerges. That needs to change to adopt the logic that underpins airport security screening: assume that every public procurement is corrupt until proven otherwise, and it should not proceed until it has gone through a transparent process of scrutiny. Proceedings of procurement boards, including reasons for decisions, should be video recorded and made public.

Third, periodic integrity testing of officials can heighten the risk of detection. This can be âtargetedâ at specific officials for whom complaints about corruption do not appear sufficient for criminal prosecution. An example is what the undercover journalism Anas Aremeyaw Anas has done so effectively. But integrity testing can also be ârandomâ and aimed at potential offenders.

Anti-corruption interventions also need to be part of broader reforms to build the stateâs legitimacy. Weak bonds with the state create a predatory relationship in which some citizens seek to exploit it for their individual and group interests.",0
156,"A prisoner ran a two-year-long drug smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone and mail, a court has heard.

Craig Sutton, 37, carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.

The offences only came to light when Sutton's cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.

He will be sentenced in October.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit Â£30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.

The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.

Letters seized

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton's cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.

A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.

""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson's bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""

Prisons investigation

Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.

Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""

Lord Burns said: ""It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.""",1
1062,"The global impact of money laundering is staggering; with related transactions estimated at 2 to 5% of global GDP  amounting to up to $2 trillion. The IMF defines money laundering as a process of conducting financial transactions in a manner that obscures the link between funds and their origin. However, money laundering is more than just a financial crime  performed by criminals and terrorists to finance their illegal activities, it not only hampers the global economy but also poses a threat to security.

Even though anti-money laundering (AML) solutions and regulations are in place across the world, less than 1% of illicit financial flows are currently seized by authorities due to the complex nature of the activity. Global spend on AML compliance is expected to cross $8 billion by 2017, but countries as well as financial institutions are unable to enforce these policies effectively enough to plug the holes in their systems.

Its clear that traditional AML solutions are unable to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of financial transactions that need to be monitored for laundering activities. Meanwhile, money launderers are constantly discovering more innovative ways to conduct illicit financial transactions, while the institutions attempt to catch up with these increasingly sophisticated criminals. The need of the hour is an innovative technology which can combat money laundering in a scalable, cost-effective and comprehensive manner.

Challenges of Existing AML Solutions

Aging AML solutions are inadequate to meet todays business challenges and are unprepared for tomorrows needs. The existing transaction monitoring systems, based on traditional technology, are unable to keep pace with the growing wave of new digital financial services, including cryptocurrencies. Criminals have begun leveraging these emerging channels for their money laundering activities, making it even harder for authorities to trace them.

Unlike traditional financial transactions that require financial institutions as intermediaries, crypto and other digital routes are faster, encrypted for greater security, often anonymous and in most parts of the world, remain unregulated by governments till date. Existing AML solutions are not equipped to investigate these highly encrypted and P2P forms of financial transactions yet.

Secondly, most AML efforts that are currently implemented are highly individualistic in nature, with each financial institution deploying its own solution and every country having its own laws to prevent money laundering. There is also not enough standardization and the lack of collaboration makes money laundering more challenging to detect and act against.

Rising globalization has caused an exponential increase in cross-border financial transactions. The volume and complexity of financial transactions have increased manifold. Without automation, end-to-end analytics and limited visualization capabilities, traditional transaction monitoring tools and solutions are being rendered ineffective.

Blockchain for AML Transaction Monitoring

Blockchain is essentially a cryptographic ledger comprising of a digital log of transactions which can be shared across a public or private network. The technology, by its very nature, lends itself to integrated decentralized monitoring efforts of financial transactions.

An anti-money laundering system built on the blockchain can leverage the cryptographically secure, decentralized and immutable nature of the technology to identify and stop suspicious transactions effectively. A distributed blockchain-based system using smart-contracts with inbuilt algorithms, will allow financial institutions to securely parse data through an AML engine on the blockchain; with the automation providing high efficiency and ensuring minimum friction.

Each financial institution which would be part of this system would serve as a node within the private permissioned blockchain network, and would use the network directory and smart contracts to record transactions on the blockchain.

Since relevant information would be stored in the blockchain and be made available to each node, suspicious activity can be detected and highlighted to all related participants. Alerts can then be issued to stakeholders and the transaction can automatically be flagged and stopped for further investigation. The blockchain network is immediately updated with the record of such an alert in an immutable and tamper-proof manner.

A blockchain-based AML platform makes it possible for regulatory authorities, risk officers, auditors and other relevant stakeholders to monitor complex transactions in an automated and effective manner, as well as immutably record audit trails of suspicious transactions across the system.

The design of the blockchain can ensure compliance with data sovereignty laws while complementing existing legacy AML solutions, enhancing their effectiveness by adding an additional layer of scrutiny and visibility. The overall platform based on blockchain can be used by participating financial institutions to instantly alert each other about any potentially fraudulent transactions and flag them for further investigation.

Getting started  harnessing the potential of Blockchain for AML transaction monitoring

Any risk executive looking to harness the potential of blockchain for AML within a financial institution, auditory or regulatory authority should consider the following methodology to get started:

Understand application of Blockchain for AML and secure executive sponsorship  Before embarking on a blockchain project, it is imperative to get a good understanding of distributed ledger technology and how it can be leveraged for AML transaction monitoring.

Form a working group, validate hypothesis and design a PoC engagement to get started with  Identify a core team with representation from across stakeholder groups to collaboratively work on the initiative. Engage external experts to form a well-rounded and well-informed team.
On-board participants and kick-off the project  Set up a lab-like environment. Start small. Begin with a few select cases/red flag triggers that can be showcased to a wider audience to highlight benefits and prime adoption.

Develop the prototype for select use cases  Use the experimental environment and a technical team to set up the blockchain network, develop the application and deploy the smart contracts

Evaluate the prototype(s) and pick the ones most promising for mainstream deployment  Once the prototype(s) are developed, tested rigorously by the team and validated by the stakeholders, select winners that can be adopted and piloted on an enterprise-wide level.

Considerations for Mainstream Deployment of Blockchain-based AML Solution

The technology is still in its early days and use cases exploring the potential of blockchain are isolated and limited. However, to truly realize their potential, implementations of blockchain based solutions for AML need to be integrated into the core IT landscape within each participating institution.

If deployed within a bank to connect its various globally dispersed branches, the decentralized system will complement existing legacy AML applications and add an extra ring of scrutiny and visibility.

Leveraging a blockchain platform for AML nationwide or across a geographical region will give regulators, auditors and other stakeholders an effective and powerful set of tools to monitor complex transactions and immutably record the audit trail of suspicious transactions across the system. However, this will need cross-industry participation and require buy-in from leaders across regulatory authorities as well as the participating banks and other financial institutions.

Either way, its only a matter of time before financial institutions and regulators adopt distributed ledger technology to connect, gain visibility and collaboratively prevent money laundering.",0
687,"As U.S. jobless claims swell during the pandemic, authorities are urging financial institutions to watch for schemes involving unemployment insurance payments

U.S. unemployment claims, which have surged during the coronavirus pandemic, are amplifying a compliance risk for financial institutions: unemployment insurance fraud.

The Treasury Departmentâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory Tuesday, alerting banks to red flags that could indicate illicit activity, including emerging schemes exploiting vulnerabilities created by the pandemic. In particular, U.S. authorities and financial institutions have spotted instances of fraud related to unemployment payments, according to FinCEN.

Unemployment insurance is a prime target for fraudsters, given the high volume of people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, according to Raymond Dookhie, a managing director at compliance advisory firm K2 Intelligence LLC.

âThe financial systems that are set up to monitor fraud in this current environment are being overloaded,â he said.

Smaller financial institutions, which often have less sophisticated monitoring systems or fewer resources to investigate suspicious activity, are particularly vulnerable, Mr. Dookhie said.

Pandemic-related unemployment fraud could include the use of fake or stolen identities, misrepresentation of income, false claims of having worked for a legitimate company or, in some cases, for a fictitious one, using falsified employee and wage records, FinCEN said.

Schemes also could involve collusion between employers and employees, in which a worker receives unemployment payments as the employer continues to pay the person a reduced wage under the table, according to FinCEN.

The Treasuryâs financial crime unit encouraged financial institutions to conduct additional investigations when appropriate and highlighted possible indicators of illicit activity, such as customers who receive unemployment insurance payments from a state other than the one where the customer claims to reside or have previously worked.

Other indicators of fraud could include unemployment insurance payments from multiple states within the same disbursement time frame and payments that are quickly sent via wire transfer to foreign accounts, particularly in countries with weak anti-money-laundering controls, FinCEN said.

FinCEN also warned of customers who send unemployment insurance payments to a peer-to-peer application or app, then wire the funds to overseas accounts or deposit checks in accounts held by a suspected front company.

Financial institutions are required to file reports that identify suspicious transactions. Such suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are intended to help federal authorities disrupt the flow of money to terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and other bad actors.

âFinancial institutions are effectively at the front lines against the fight against fraud,â Mr. Dookhie said, adding that the guidance would help banks update monitoring systems as fraudstersâ methods evolve.

âFor any surveillance program to be effective, it needs to be periodically updated to reflect the current environment,â he said. âGiven the pandemic, itâs important for those financial institutions to consider all of the types of fraud schemes that can occur.â",0
945,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces killed at least one anti-government protester using live gunfire and wounded at least 40 others in the southern city of Basra on Friday, security sources and a rights official said.

It was the first killing of a protester by security forces in Basra since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office in May.

Iraqs interior ministry confirmed the death but said in a statement that no Iraqi security forces were being allowed to use weapons against demonstrators and that it was investigating the incident.

Deadly flare-ups have been rare since protests against Iraqs ruling elite and demanding jobs and services largely subsided earlier this year.

During months of anti-government protests that erupted under his predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi in October 2019, more than 500 people were killed, mostly young unarmed demonstrators.

The Basra security sources and rights official said several dozen protesters had taken to the streets in the countrys southern oil hub on Friday demanding jobs and basic services.

They were angry that Kadhimi had generally failed to deliver on both and that protest camps had been cleared by security force in Basra and Baghdad, the rights official said.

Kadhimi, who visited Basra on Thursday to tour energy projects and meet provincial officials, has pledged to protect non-violent Iraqi protesters and bring justice for the families of those killed last year by security forces and unidentified gunmen.

Security forces in Baghdad last month were ordered not to use live fire in dealing with protests to mark the anniversary of the 2019 demonstrations.",0

The courts decision on Friday was necessitated by a judgment of then assigned Judge Peter Gbeneweleh of the 13 th Judicial Circuit Court in Margibi County. However, Gbeneweleh dismissed the Korean businessmens US$2,849,000 Action of Damages for Wrong lawsuit against the NSA.

The investors in their 2015 suit claimed that while in custody at NSA headquarters, they were stripped naked and subjected to various forms of humiliation without any formal charge and were never advised of their rights as required by the law.

In his ruling at the time, Judge Gbeneweleh said that the Korean nationals produced insufficient evidence to reasonably support their accusation that they were subjected to various forms of humiliation and degradation, thereby supporting the NSA lawyers Motion for Judgment During Trial filed to the court.

A motion for judgment as a matter of law, is made by a party during trial, claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case. If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party, judgment is entered by the court and the case is over, a legal expert explained to the Daily Observer.

Besides, Gbeneweleh ordered that the NSAs operatives should not take the witness stand to provide their individual testimony about the accusation.

However, reading the High Courts opinion, Justice Yussif Kaba, said the evidence produced by the Korean investors when they rested their case created a rebuttal presumption, therefore, the trial judge was in error when he granted the judgment during the trial.

Justice Kaba: The courts judgment is reversed, therefore, the case is hereby remanded for a new trial.

It can be recalled that the Jallah Commission produced a 3-volume, 399-page report and handed it at first to Dr. Edward McClain (now deceased), then Minister of State for Presidential affairs, instead of President Sirleaf.

The Jallah Commission found out that the Korean businessmen committed no crime as the NSA had alleged to justify the seizure and arrest.

Further, the Jallah Commission uncovered an NSA operatives conspiracy directly involved, along with the gold dealer Naseer Aly, and two others from outside the agency, to defraud the Korean businessmen.

Among the reports recommendations, the committee called for return of the cash seized to the Korean businessmen, and for the matter to be referred to the Ministry of Justice to prosecute all conspirators.

The investigation further found that the seizure was an NSA operatives conspiracy and co-conspirators outside the agency, who had lured the Korean businessmen to Liberia, and recommended prosecution of all perpetrators.

President Sirleaf did not heed to the Jallahs recommendation, which prompted the Korean investors to file the lawsuit of US$2,849,000 as damages against the NSA.

Madam Christiana Tah, then Minister of Justice and Attorney General, resigned, accusing President Sirleaf of interference in an NSA investigation.

The case grew when a group of four Korean businessmen had arranged the purchase of gold bars through emails with Nasser Aly, whom they believed to be a Lebanese gold dealer with mining interests in Liberia.

Under the deal negotiated by Kim Aleck, one of the Korean businessmen, the counter parties agreed to the sale of 16 kilograms (35 lbs) of gold at the price of US$568,000.

Half of the purchase price, amounting to US$284,000, was to be paid upfront in Liberia.

On July 8, 2014, the NSA operatives carried out a raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia, without a warrant.

Five NSA operatives burst into a hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes.

The NSA seized cash in the amount of US$247,500 and other possessions, including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards.

Earlier, on the day of the raid, the Korean businessmen had withdrawn the same amount of money seized from the Sinkor, Old Road branch of the International Bank of Liberia and then gone directly to the City King Hotel, expecting to complete the transaction with Aly.

The Korean businessmen were arrested by the operatives and taken from the hotel to the headquarters of the NSA.

Later, NSA charged the Korean nationals with the commission of crimes of illegal possession of combustible cyanide that posed national security risk to the lives of Liberians, money laundering, counterfeiting, and conspiracy to defraud the government.

The criminal charges were later dropped against the Korean investors by the Criminal Court C at the Temple of Justice, which prompted their civil lawsuit against the NSA.",1

The University of Oslo (Norwegian: Universitetet i Oslo; Latin: Universitas Osloensis), until 1939 named the Royal Frederick University (Norwegian: Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet; Latin: Universitas Regia Fredericiana), is the oldest university in Norway, located in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Until 1 January 2016 it was the largest Norwegian institution of higher education in terms of size, now surpassed only by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. [3] The Academic Ranking of World Universities has ranked it the 58th best university in the world and the third best in the Nordic countries. [4] In 2015, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked it the 135th best university in the world and the seventh best in the Nordics. [5] While in its 2016, Top 200 Rankings of European universities, the Times Higher Education listed the University of Oslo at 63rd, making it the highest ranked Norwegian university. [6]

The university has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. [7] Its faculties include (Lutheran) Theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), Law, Medicine, Humanities, Mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, Dentistry, and Education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as CICERO, NKVTS and the Frisch Centre.

The university was founded in 1811 and was modeled after the University of Copenhagen and the recently established University of Berlin. It was originally named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway and received its current name in 1939. The university is informally also known as Universitetet (""the university""), having been the only university in Norway, until 1946 and was commonly referred to as ""The Royal Frederick's"" (Det Kgl. Frederiks), prior to the name change.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and will be so again in 2020, making it the only university in the world to be involved in awarding a Nobel Prize. [8] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates. [9]

Early history[ edit ]

King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway was the founder of the university

In 1811, a decision was made to establish the first university in the Dano-Norwegian Union, after an agreement was reached with King Frederik VI, who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies. In 1813, The Royal Frederik's University was founded in Christiania (later renamed Oslo), a small city at that time. Circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement [ clarification needed ] of the university, as Norway proclaimed independence. However, independence was somewhat restricted, as Norway was obliged to enter into a legislative union with Sweden based on the outcome of the War of 1814. Norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions, although royal power and foreign affairs were shared [ clarification needed ] with Sweden. At a time when Norwegians feared political domination by the Swedes, the new university became a key institution that contributed to Norwegian political and cultural independence.

The main initial function of The Royal Frederick University was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants, as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers. The university also became the centre for a survey of the countrya survey of culture, language, history and folk traditions. The staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society. Throughout the 1800s, the university's academic disciplines gradually became more specialised.

One of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research, the management of the university became more professional, academic subjects were reformed, and the forms of teaching evolved. Classical education came under increasing pressure. [ clarification needed ]

When the union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security. Education, health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university's graduates.

19001945[ edit ]

Research changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods, scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research. It was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers. Scientific researchwhether to launch or test out new theories, to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplinesbecame part of the increased expectations placed on the university. Developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge, not merely competence in theology or law, for example. The university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation.

The position of rector was established by Parliament in 1905 following the Dissolution of the Union. Waldemar Christofer Brøgger was Professor of Geology and became the university's first rector. Brøgger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives. With the establishment of the national research council after World War II, Brøgger's vision was largely fulfilled; research received funding independent of teaching. This coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s, which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching. In the years leading up to 1940, research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation, with progress and self-assertion; research was also seen to contribute to Norway's commitment to international academic and cultural development.

During the period after World War I, research among Norwegian researchers resulted in two Nobel prizes. The Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch. The Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Odd Hassel. In the field of linguistics, several Norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally. Increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included Norway. Student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940, and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical, gender and social bases. The working class was still largely left behind, however.

During the German occupation, which lasted from 19401945, the university rector, Didrik Arup Seip, was imprisoned. The university was then placed under the management of Adolf Hoel, a NS (Norwegian Nazi Party) appointee. A number of students participated in the Norwegian resistance movement; after fire was set in the university auditorium, Reich Commissar Terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested. A number of students and teachers were detained by the Germans nearly until the end of the war.

19452000[ edit ]

After WWII, public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance; the State Educational Loan Fund for Young Students was established in 1947. As a result, the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers. Many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war; they could now enroll. For the 1945 autumn semester, 5951 students registered at the university. This represented the highest student enrollment at UiO up to that time. In 1947, the number had risen to more than 6000 students. This represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled prior to the war.

In no previous period had a single decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s. The decade represented an unparalleled period of growth. From 1960 to 1970, student enrollment tripled, rising from 5,600 to 16,800. This tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived, from both the inside and the outside. As it turned out, the changes were even more comprehensive. The university campus at Blindern was expanded, and the number of academic and administrative employees rose. The number of academic positions doubled, from fewer than 500 to around 1,200. The increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation. The expansion of the Blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students. The explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the Blindern campus in particular. The faculties situated in central OsloLaw and Medicineexperienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s, while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled.

By 1968, revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students. The ""Student Uprising"" became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world. Often, the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak. More than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models. The ""University of the Masses"" was unable to lift all its students to the ""lofty, elite positions"" enjoyed by previous generations of academics. Many students dissociated themselves, therefore, from the so-called ""establishment"" and the way the establishment functioned. Many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society. It was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged.

The most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of women students. Throughout the 1970s, the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students. At the same time, the university became a centre for the organised women's liberation movement, which emerged in the 1970s.

Up until the millennium, the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partially to the poor labour market.

The highest position at the university is Professor, i.e. ""full Professor."" In Norway, the title ""Professor,"" which is protected by law, is only used for full professors. Prior to 1990, all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the King-in-Council, i.e. by the King upon the advice of the Cabinet. The position below Professor was historically Docent (translated as Reader in a UK context and Professor in an American context). In 1985, all Docents became full professors. The most common positions below that are førsteamanuensis (translated as Associate Professor), and amanuensis or universitetslektor (translated as Lecturer or Assistant Professor). At the University of Oslo, almost all new permanent positions are announced at the Associate Professor level; an associate professor may apply for promotion to full professor if he or she holds the necessary competence.

Additionally, there are temporary, qualifying positions such as stipendiat (Research Fellow) and postdoktor (Postdoctoral Fellow).

A small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks researcher, senior researcher and research professor, which correspond to assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.

Several other less common academic positions also exist. Historically, only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university. Originally, all professors were automatically members of the Collegium Academicum, the highest governing body of the university, but soon afterwards its membership was limited. Docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. In 1975, the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies, as the last group. Formerly by law, and now by tradition, the highest positions, such as Rector or Dean, are only held by professors. They are elected by the academic community (academics and students) and by the technical-administrative support staff, but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight.

The university's research structure consists of eight schools, or ""faculties."" They are the Faculties of Dentistry, Educational Sciences, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Theology. [10]

The university's old campus, strongly influenced by Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel 's neoclassical style, is located in the centre of Oslo near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace and the Parliament. The old campus was then occupied by the Faculty of Law and most of the other faculties have been transferred to the Blindern campus in the suburban West End, erected in the 1930s. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area.

The Faculty of Theology sponsors 8 research groups in the following fields: [11]

The University of Oslo has a long list of notable academics and alumni, spanning the fields of scholarship covered by the university. The university is home to five Nobel Prize winners and is institutionally tied to some of the most prestigious prizes in the world. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's atrium between 1947 and 1989, thus making it the only university to host a Nobel Prize ceremony. [13] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the university's atrium.

In July 2015, the University received intense criticism for allowing Anders Behring Breivik to be admitted to study for a 3-year baccalaureate degree in political science (including courses on democracy, human rights, and respect for minorities). He is the perpetrator of the 22 July, 2011 Norway attacks, Norway's worst incident of violence since World War II; he received 21 years in prison (he can be paroled after 10 years; but he can be confined after the 21 years are up, allowable for five years at a time, if he is viewed as still dangerous, resulting in an actual life sentence). The Rector said they were obliged to follow the regulations, which allowed it because his grades were good enough. It will be done in solitary confinement, with guards delivering his assignments and the finished work and the grades. [14] In October 2018, it was reported that course materials were being provided to Breivik by a prison officer and that he had no contact with students or academics or access to the internet. [15]

Some of the notable academics of the university are:

Vilhelm Aubert (Professor of Sociology)
Fredrik Barth (Professor of Social Anthropology)
Jon Bing (Professor of Law; pioneer of legal informatics)

331,"Finlandâs Supreme Court has denied convicted former drug cop Jari Aarnio leave to appeal a 10-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of a welter of offences relating to drug trafficking and official misconduct.

In June, the Helsinki Appeal Court upheld a lower court verdict that found the once-celebrated drug buster guilty of smuggling hashish into Finland in barrels â resulting in the ""barrel case"" moniker. Aarnio was sentenced to 10 years in prison on five counts of aggravated drug offences, aggravated evidence tampering, witness intimidation and several counts of official misconduct.

The Supreme Courtâs refusal to grant Aarnio leave to challenge the appellate courtâs ruling means that his prison sentence will remain in force. Altogether, he will serve a 13-year sentence: 10 years for the drug and official misconduct offences and three years in a separate case in which he used his position as a police squad chief to purchase equipment from a company in which he was involved -- the so-called Trevoc case.

However the Supreme Court will continue to hear appeals regarding other aspects of the ex-cop's drug smuggling case. One of the appeals relates to a female defendant convicted on a series of drug offences, as well as an appeal related to the sentencing and dismissal of one of Aarnioâs subordinates. The court will provide a limited hearing of these challenges.

In the latter case, the district court had ordered the dismissal of Aarnioâs subordinate. The appeal court reversed that order, but the prosecutor appealed the higher courtâs decision. The individual later resigned from the Helsinki police department.

Apart from Aarnio, his subordinate and the female defendant, all of whom filed appeals, the Aarnio case features other central figures. One of them is the so-called ""Malmi woman"" who was sentenced to three years in prison for aggravated drug offences. The other was former gang leader Keijo Vilhunen. In both of those cases, the courtâs sentence remained in force.

New suspicions: Senior police officer accused of helping Aarnio

On Wednesday a new suspect emerged in the web of crime surrounding Jari Aarnio. The Helsinki prosecutorâs office said that it had laid charges against a senior Helsinki police officer suspected of official misconduct.

According to the charge sheet, the detective chief inspector in question had, at Aarnioâs request, checked to see whether or not police were in the process of obtaining information about Aarnio. The suspected offences are believed to have occurred between November and December 2016.

The suspect has denied the charges and the case will be heard later on in the Helsinki district court. Two other suspects were also under investigation for the same reason. Aarnio and another police officer are believed to have pressed the suspect to fulfill Aarnioâs requests.

However no charges were laid against Aarnio over these suspicions, as they would not have affected his other sentences. He had already been convicted and had lost his position as head of the Helsinki drug squad.

In the case of the other suspect believed to have acted in concert with Aarnio, investigators did not find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. During the preliminary investigation he admitted to asking his colleague ""to back Aarnio up mainly to calm him down"", but he received a negative response.",1

German police are investigating a ""probable terrorist attack"" after a man ploughed a lorry into a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.

The driver, a Pakistani asylum seeker who entered Germany last year, is being questioned.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be ""particularly sickening"" if he were proven to be a refugee.

He was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terror links.

German media say police have searched a refugee shelter at a defunct Berlin airport where the suspect was believed to be staying.

Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man was probably from Pakistan, and that his application for asylum had not yet been processed.

The suspect denies involvement, Mr de Maiziere said.

Berlin attack: What we know

""We have to assume this was a terrorist attack"", Mrs Merkel said in a short statement on Tuesday.

Those behind the attack would be punished ""as harshly as the law allows"", she added.

What happened?

The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in Berlin's west.

The attack happened in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which was damaged in a World War Two bombing raid and preserved as a symbol of peace.

The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), one of its busiest times. It crashed through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.

The DPA news agency said police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area.

What do we know about the suspect?

German media have identified the suspect, citing security sources, as a 23-year-old Pakistani named Naved B who entered the country in either late 2015 or early 2016.

Reports said special forces had stormed a hangar at Berlin's Tempelhof airport where they believed the suspect had been living in a shelter before the attack.

Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said he was seized after leaving the lorry and fleeing on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.

A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.

Where did the lorry come from?

Police said a Polish man, believed to be the original driver, had been found dead on the passenger seat.

Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.

""We don't know what happened to him,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him.""

The truck was registered in Poland, but it is unclear whether it was travelling from Poland or returning from Italy, as some reports suggest.

How has Germany reacted?

Chancellor Merkel said she was ""shocked and very saddened"" by the attack but added ""we don't want to live with fear of evil"".

Germany's interior ministry said Christmas markets in Berlin would remain closed on Tuesday but other markets outside of the capital will operate as normal.

A senior member of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Marcus Pretzell, blamed Mrs Merkel for the attack, linking it to her open-door migration policy which saw the arrival of more than one million people last year.

What do eyewitnesses say happened?

A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press that the 25-tonne lorry had missed him by only about three metres as it smashed through stands and knocked down a large Christmas tree.

""It was definitely deliberate,"" said the tourist.

He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.

Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed ""blood and bodies everywhere"".

""I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed.

""I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there.""

'I heard the noise and the screams'

Is this the first such attack?

A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Ten people were killed and dozens more injured in separate gun, bomb, axe and machete attacks in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg in July.

A year of terror in Germany

But Monday's incident was reminiscent of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).

The mayor of Nice, Philippe Pradal, said the Berlin incident shared the same ""blind violence"" as the attack on his city.

Both IS and al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds.

The US labelled the tragedy an apparent ""terrorist attack"" and pledged its support.

President-elect Donald Trump blamed ""Islamist terrorists"" for a ""slaughter"" of Christians in the German capital.

""Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!"" he tweeted.

864,"PASAY CITY, Oct. 29 -- Senator Christopher âBongâ Go has expressed his support for proposed measures that aim to strengthen anti-money laundering efforts in the Philippines in compliance with the legal standards set by concerned international bodies.

During a Senate Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies hearing on Wednesday, October 28, Go echoed the calls of President Rodrigo Duterte and Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III to strengthen efforts against money laundering in the country through the proposed Senate Bill 1412 and its counterpart House Bill 6174.

Go noted that Duterte has certified the proposed measure as urgent.
âI echo the Presidentâs call to comply with legal standards for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing, as established by relevant international bodies,â Go said during the hearing.

The proposed measures seek to strengthen Republic Act 9160 or the âAnti-Money Laundering Act of 2001â, making the country compliant with the legal standards set by international bodies in addressing money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities.

Go cited that just last March, the Bureau of Customs confirmed that $370 million in dirty money entered the country. According to the DOF, two groups allegedly laundered around $167.97 million and $200.24 million, respectively.

In response, Dominguez ordered the BOC to work with the Anti-Money Laundering Council in investigating the entry into the country of dirty money.

In the hearing, Go also expressed his support for the inclusion of tax crimes and violation of the Strategic Trade and Management Act, which indirectly includes proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as predicate to money laundering.
Moreover, Go said that the swift passage of the measure will also benefit overseas Filipino workers.
âPossible na sila po ang direktang maapektuhan dahil kapag hindi po na-amend ang ating Anti-Money Laundering Law, maaari pong ma grey list ang Pilipinas ng Financial Action Task Force at tumaas ang cost ng remittance rates para sa ating mga OFWs,â he said.
âNararapat lamang po na maglaan tayo ng sapat na proteksyon upang mapangalagaan ang kapakanan ng ating mga kababayan. Our campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs,â he added.
Ending his statement, Go emphasized that strengthening laws against money laundering will boost the governmentâs fight against criminality.

âOur campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs. Amidst the continuing pandemic that has hampered, not just the economy but also the lives of our brothers and sisters, criminality and corruption have become more important issues that we must take seriously,â said Go.

âAt the time when our people are experiencing unprecedented hardships, every single centavo counts. Make no mistake, tutuluyan talaga namin ni Presidente ang mga manloloko at magnanakaw,â he added.

Go also stressed that he and Duterte have always adopted a firm opposition against any form of terrorism.

âWe are one in our vision to exterminate terrorism and improve our anti-terrorism efforts,â he said.

âDapat po putulin at hadlangan ang lahat ng kahit anumang makakatulong sa mga teroristang walang ibang ginagawa kundi manggulo lang po sa ating bayan,â he ended. (OSBG)",0
705,"Florida officials recently launched the Highway Heroes campaign, which aims to involve truck drivers in the fight to end human trafficking.

Attorney General Ashley Moody and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) on Oct. 26 launched the campaign, which aims to enlist 500,000 truckers. Human trafficking, which involves the use of force to obtain labor or a commercial sex act, exploits about 25 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking.

The Highway Heroes campaign involves outreach materials, which are mailed to commercial driver license holders, and a new webpage that has resources on how to spot signs of human trafficking and report suspected crimes. Indicators that someone may be a victim include anxious behavior, malnourishment and lack of control over identification documents and money.

âTruck drivers play an important role in our fight to end human trafficking,â said Moody, who serves as chair of the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking. âBy spending so much time on the road, visiting truck stops and communicating with each other regularly, these drivers create a powerful network that can be called upon to spot and report suspected human trafficking.â

According to FLHSMV Executive Director Terry Rhodes, more than 500,000 licensed commercial drivers are licensed in Florida. As part of the program, approximately 500,000 letters will be sent to CDL holders by Oct. 30. The letters explain what human trafficking is and direct the reader to the Highway Heroes website, which contains training resources created by Truckers Against Trafficking.

TAT is a national group that educates members of the trucking industry about combating human trafficking. The Highway Heroes campaign offers every trucker in Florida the opportunity to become a TAT-trained driver.

TAT Deputy Director Kylla Lanier said Florida officialsâ concerted effort to create the Highway Heroes program represents an example she hopes other states will replicate.

As part of our #HighwayHeroes initiative, we launched a new website full of information and resources for truckers to learn how to spot trafficking, gather evidence, report the crime and become a Certified #TruckerAgainstTrafficking. https://t.co/jiYZ2q0rKn pic.twitter.com/eqBls00YMG

â AG Ashley Moody (@AGAshleyMoody) October 26, 2020

âWe are receiving requests for more materials from Floridaâs professional drivers and an outpouring of positive comments about their being a part of the solution to this heinous crime,â Lanier told Transport Topics.

Additionally, Highway Heroes will launch a digital media campaign geared toward CDL holders in Florida with messages about human trafficking. The digital campaign will run through January, which is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.

Some 12,000 miles of highway run through Florida, according to the letter mailed out as part of the campaign. According to the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking, Florida ranks third in the nation in number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.

âTruck drivers serve as the eyes and ears on our roads â ensuring everyone stays safe,â said Florida Trucking Association President Ken Armstrong. âThe members of FTA have made it a priority to train their professional drivers to spot and report human trafficking, with almost 1 million drivers having already received the training nationally. We encourage all Florida commercial truck drivers to become a certified Trucker Against Trafficking.â

Fighting human trafficking has been emphasized at the federal level in recent years. In January, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao challenged industry representatives to commit to practices that help combat human trafficking. Specifically, Chao asked for 100 pledges to combat human trafficking in 100 days, a goal that industry members exceeded.

In 2019, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced a final rule that permanently banned commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been convicted of human trafficking. The rulemaking specifically disqualifies drivers who use a truck to commit a felony involving human trafficking.",0
496,"The UKs financial regulator has fined Commerzbank £38m for money-laundering failures, including an out-of-control system for checking clients.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the German business bank had failed to put money-laundering controls in place over a period of five years, despite three separate warnings from the regulator.

The fine is one of the largest handed out by the regulator in relation to money-laundering failures. Standard Chartered was fined £102m by the FCA in April 2019 for similar issues, although that was dwarfed by the $1.1bn penalty levied on the same bank by US authorities.

Commerzbank London qualified for a 30% discount on the fine because it agreed to cooperate. The full fine would have been £54m.

Due diligence checks on more than 1,700 clients of Commerzbanks London office were overdue by 2017, when the regulator took action.

Some of these customers were able to carry on transactions with the bank despite the checks not having been completed because of an out-of-control system of exceptions, the FCA said.

The bank also failed to fix an automated tool for monitoring money-laundering risks. The FCA said Commerzbank London in 2015 found that 40 high-risk countries were missing from the tool, and 1,110 high-risk clients had not been added.

Commerzbanks policies and procedures for customer due diligence were found to be inadequate.

Mark Steward, the FCAs executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: Commerzbank Londons failings over several years created a significant risk that financial and other crime might be undetected. Firms should recognise that [anti-money laundering] controls are vitally important to the integrity of the UK financial system.

The bank has been forced to carry out a significant remediation exercise to put the processes in place, as well as appointing a senior executive to test it.

The fine will add to financial pressure on Commerzbank, which hopes to cut costs after sustaining a 227m (£203m) loss before tax in the first three months of 2020.

A spokeswoman for the bank said the FCA had found no financial crime during its investigations. Commerzbank has cooperated fully with the Financial Conduct Authority to mitigate any potential compliance risks promptly and appropriately, she said.

The FCA investigation relates to the time period of October 2012 to September 2017. The bank has successfully remediated and addressed the deficiencies that were the subject of the investigation.",1
488,"Greenbelt, Maryland  A federal jury in Maryland yesterday convicted Nigerian national Seun Banjo Ojedokun, age 37, for a money laundering conspiracy related to a romance scam and other fraud schemes.

The conviction was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur and Special Agent in Charge Jennifer C. Boone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.

U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur stated, This defendant was part of a conspiracy that stole from many vulnerable and elderly victims across the United States, defrauding them through lies and laundering the funds internationally. The deceit used to steal from these victims was heartless, considering how vulnerable and financially devastated they were. Ojedokun was in Nigeria when he was committing these crimes. Law enforcement was able to arrest him when he came to the United States to attend school here. The U.S. Attorneys Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing to justice fraudsters who prey upon the elderly. We will continue our outreach efforts to make the public aware of scams and frauds targeting elderly victims and encourage anyone who believes they may be a victim to contact the newly launched Elder Fraud Hotline at 833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311).

These targeted scams are all to prevalent and the FBI, along with our law enforcement partners, are diligently working to alert and protect the public from falling victim, said Jennifer C. Boone, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. The arrest and conviction of Mr. Ojedokun, who was operating in Nigeria during the conspiracy, demonstrates the lengths that the FBI will go in order to hold accountable the people who commit these heinous crimes.

According to the evidence presented at his six-day trial, between 2013 and March 2015, Ojedokun conspired with Gbenga Benson Ogundele, Mukhtar Danjuma Haruna, a/k/a Mukky, and others to use money deposited into bank accounts by fraud victims to engage in financial transactions in order to promote the fraud scheme and conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the fraud proceeds.

According to evidence presented at trial, members of the conspiracy searched online dating websites to initiate romantic relationships with vulnerable men and women. They phoned, e-mailed, texted and used Internet chat messenger services to form romantic relationships with the victims, who lived throughout the United States.

Specifically, witnesses testified that members of the conspiracy used false stories and promises to convince the many victims to provide money to the conspirators, including fake hospital bills, plane trips to visit the victims, problems with overseas businesses, and foreign taxes. Ogundele and other conspirators opened bank accounts, called drop accounts, in order to receive millions of dollars from the victims. Testimony at trial showed that victims provided money to the conspirators as a result of the false stories and promises, either depositing money directly into drop accounts controlled by the conspirators, or by checks sent to the conspirators. The loss to the eight victims who testified at trial was well over $1 million and the overall total loss was substantially higher.

In addition, the evidence at trial showed that the conspirators engaged in other types of fraud, including a fraudulent employment scam in which the victim was led to believe she had been hired by a company, and was instructed to deposit the proceeds of a fraudulent check into a drop account controlled by the conspirators.

According to the evidence, Ojedokun, Ogundele, Haruna, and their co-conspirators laundered money received from the fraud victims by buying used cars and shipping them to Nigeria, among other methods. As part of the fraud schemes, Ojedokun and his co-conspirators transmitted and used images of financial transactions, including bank deposit receipts and wire transfer forms, as proof that a deposit of fraud money had been made by a victim.

Ogundele, age 61, formerly of Laurel, Maryland, was convicted in 2016 after a 17-day trial, of conspiracies to commit money laundering and wire fraud, as well as aggravated identity theft, and was sentenced to 234 months in federal prison. Haruna, age 46, of Nigeria, remains a fugitive and charges against him are still pending. In addition to Ogundele, eight other defendants were convicted for their roles in the fraud scheme and were sentenced to between a year and a day and 234 months in federal prison.

Ojedokun faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. U.S. District Judge Paul W. Grimm has scheduled sentencing for January 20, 2021 at 10:00 a.m.

United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FBI for its work in the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Windom and U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur represented the United States at trial.

1076,"How hard is it to ferret out securities fraud? It might be as easy as looking for how many times the digit `1 appears in a company's financial entries instead of 9.

A simple mathematical law that applies to everything from the height of mountains to the population of towns in Tajikistan can also be used to uncover suspicious numbers in public-company accounting, an expert at Columbia Business School says in a new paper.

Benfords Law states that the quantity of most things in the real world is more likely to be described by a number beginning in 1 than any other digit, and the likelihood of it being described by other digits declines as those digits get higher.

When Columbias Dan Amiram and two coauthors applied Benfords Law to public companies, they found the same rules hold true: Companies whose financial statements were significantly out of compliance with the law were far more likely to get caught by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities. And when companies restated their earnings, a before-and-after comparison showed that the new, real numbers complied with Benfords Law while the old ones didnt.

It was absolutely shocking, Amiram said of the study with coauthors Zahn Bozanic of Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business and Ethan Rouen of Columbia, which he says already has drawn inquiries from hedge funds, short-sellers annd the SEC. Every year, every industry fits perfectly to Benfords Law.

That result might seem absurd, or at least counterintuitive, given the presumably random nature of things like the number of widgets sold or profit from an aluminum smelter. Why is it more likely that a company sold 10 widgets, or 10,000, in a year than 700 or 700,000?

The answer reflects the intersection of statistics and our method of counting things. As a pure matter of math, increasing the quantity of anything from 1 to 2, or 100 to 200, or 1 million to 2 million, means a 100% increase, whereas an increase from 9 to 10, or 9 million to 10 million, only requires an 11% increase. That means any count of something in the real world is far more likely to begin with a low digit than a high digit, including when a company starts the year with revenue of $0 and increases that figure each day.

In this world, there are more small things than large things, explained Mark Nigrini, a professor of accounting at West Virginia University and author of Benford's Law, a 100,000-word treatise on the practical application of the law toward fraud, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion and other skullduggery. Any town or city would have a population with a first digit of 1 far longer than any other digit.

The actual statistical probability under Benfords Law is 30% for the digit 1, 17.6% for 2, 12.5% for 3, and so on down to 4.6% for 9. And thats what Amiram found when he studied more than 40,000 public-company annual reports from 2001 to 2011. Benford's Law described those results in aggregate, whether across the entire dataset or industry by industry. Nearly 86% of the firm-year observations complied with the law.

Things got more interesting when he looked at companies that were busted by the SEC. (He drew his data from the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases database.) There, he found companies that were ultimately caught in accounting improprieties had a statistical measure of deviation from the results predicted by Benfords Law of more than 20 times the average for all firms. Even more fascinating, that measure of deviation plunged in the three years before the companies were caught, supporting the widely accepted theory that the SEC only uncovers frauds after they start falling apart and companies can no longer fudge their numbers.

This method has the same flaw as many other fraud-detection tools: It turns up a lot of false positives, or at least companies that never show up in the SEC's enforcement database. Amiram suspects many of the companies that deviate significantly from Benfords Law may actually be cooking the books but will never be caught, either because of the SECs limited enforcement budget or because they escape the agencys five-year statute of limitations.

The reliability of this tool for detecting fraud is supported, however, by direct observations of companies that have restated earnings. Those companies showed a statistically significant shift from non-compliance with Benford's Law to compliance before and after they restated earnings.

For same firm year, the same operation, the same firm, we have two sets of numbers, Amiram said. The corrected numbers are very close to Benfords law, and the previous ones are absolutely off.

To give one example, Sprint Nextel s financials deviated from the distribution of digits predicted by Benfords Law in the two years before it restated earnings in 2001, and fell into compliance after that. AT&T results, by comparison, followed the law the entire time.

Fraudsters can try and fudge their numbers in a way that complies with Benfords predictions, but it wont be easy. In another test, Amiram deliberately altered Alcoa s financial results for 2011, changing sales, cost of goods sold and taxes randomly in 1,000 simulations. Alcoas measure of deviation increased practically every time.

Benfords Law has been used in a large number of forensic applications, including voter fraud, Greece's effort to hide its debt, and determining whether digital photographs have been altered. It's also been in the toolkit of auditors for years, said Amiram, a former auditor, but only at the level of operating accounts. He said his paper is the first to apply the law to company-level financial reports accessible through databases like Compustat.

Amiram began thinking about a Benford's Law screen on financial results after a friend who is a professor at Dartmouth sent him a Facebook link to the `10 Weirdest Math Facts."" He detailed Rouen, a Ph.D candidate, to study financial reports and quickly became convinced they had ""finally found one of the most useful applications of that law.""He's spoken to the SEC about his research, but doesn't know if the agency is using it.

Now he plays a parlor game with his students, separating them into groups of ""truth-tellers"" and ""liars"" with the first group compiling a list of the lengths of major world rivers and the second one making the numbers up. Benford's Law identifies the liars every time, he said.

When it comes to financial fraud, he said: ""If you manipulate the numbers, 90% of the time youre going to violate Benfords Law.""

Given the apparently rampant level of securities fraud that plaintiff lawyers claim to find each year, it is surprising they haven't turned to this tool as a first screen to determine whether they're suing the right company. Maybe they could even use it to find real examples of fraud, instead of waiting for the company or the SEC to disclose it first.",0

Daniel Kamensky, the founder of distressed debt hedge fund Marble Ridge Capital, was arrested and charged with fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of retailer Neiman Marcus, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday. 

Kamensky, a member of the retailers unsecured creditors committee, had earlier landed in hot water over his alleged attempts to suppress a rival bid for Neiman Marcuss MyTheresa e-commerce business so that Marble Ridge could buy the asset at a lower price, according to a preliminary report submitted as part of the bankruptcy proceedings by the U.S. Department of Justices Office of the United States Trustee. Kamensky then attempted to persuade the rival bidder to cover up the scheme, according to an announcement from the DoJs Southern District of New York. 

As alleged, Daniel Kamensky disregarded his fiduciary responsibility to unsecured creditors of Neiman Marcus  and broke the law  when he attempted to coerce a competitor to withdraw a higher bid for assets of the bankruptcy estate, said acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement Thursday. As further alleged, acknowledging the illegality of his actions, Kamensky then attempted to obstruct an investigation by trying to persuade the competitor to change his account of the coercion, telling the competitor that otherwise this is going to the U.S. Attorneys Office.  As todays charges show, Kamensky was right about that.

Strauss appeared to be referring to a phone call Kamensky made to an employee at Jefferies  the rival bidder, of which Kamensky was a client  after Kamensky had sent a chat message to the employee saying, DO NOT SEND IN A BID. (Jefferies was not named in Thursdays complaint.)

After learning that the employee had notified others about the message, he called the employee and said, [I]f youre going to continue to tell them what you just told me, Im going to jail, OK? Because they're going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right? Maybe I should go to jail, according to court documents. 

Today, weve removed the maybe, and forced him to answer for his conduct, said FBI assistant director-in-charge William Sweeney in the announcement. 

A spokesperson for Marble Ridge said the firm declined to comment on the charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges in the matter on Thursday.

Kamensky further said that he would use his official role as co-chair of the committee to prevent the investment bank from acquiring the [MyTheresa] securities, according to the complaint. Kamensky also stated that Marble Ridge had been a good partner to the investment bank, but that if the investment bank moved forward with its bid for the [MyTheresa] securities, Marble Ridge would cease doing business with the investment bank.

During a subsequent interview with the Office of the United States Trustee, Kamensky said his calls to the Jefferies employee were a terrible mistake and profound errors in lapses of judgment [that] violated the personal and professional belief I tried my best to live by, according to the complaint.

Kamensky, a former partner at hedge fund Paulson & Co., founded Marble Ridge in 2015. Marble Ridge managed more than $1 billion, according to the complaint. 

Kamensky has been charged with one count of fraud in the offer or sale of securities, one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion and bribery in connection with a bankruptcy, and one count of obstruction of justice. Each of the charges carries maximum sentences ranging from five to 20 years in prison.  

After news of Kamenskys actions on the MyTheresa bid broke last month, Marble Ridge sent a letter to its investors informing them that it planned to wind down. 

After much consideration, and in light of the operating environment, we have made the difficult decision to commence an orderly wind-down of the Marble Ridge funds, Marble Ridge told clients in a letter, according to a Reuters report on August 20. 

Last week Neiman Marcus filed a complaint against Marble Ridge and a temporary restraining order to block the fund from winding down its operations until it pays the retailer $55 million it alleges it is owed in damages. ",1
860,"Flightcaster, Prismatic and now Merlon Intelligence. Bradford Cross, partner at the venture capital firm Data Collective is a known figure in the ranks of VCs who have caught the entrepreneurship bug, abandoning what could have been a cushy lifestyle for one with considerably more volatility. His third startup, Merlon Intelligence, services banks, helping them cut down on risk and put a stop to money laundering. Merlon is announcing $7.65 million in seed financing led by none other than Data Collective.

The Merlon Intelligence platform flags and ranks risky transactions for banks. This requires both a top level prediction model and a robust data extraction and enhancement pipeline. Merlon crawls PDFs and other unstructured text to create a graph of financial and contextual knowledge.

A natural language processing system enriches this information and allows separate predictive models to make connections between events and people. That predictive model outputs a rank of suspicious activity that can then be analyzed by a human. Traditional banking analysts can provide feedback and improve the functioning of the entire system.

With a pedigree consisting of both finance and machine learning experience, Cross hopes to best legacy players like Oracle and Lexus Nexus that rely on outdated technology while getting the jump on newer entrants like Palantir that are bogged down by clunky consulting operations.

In an interview, Cross explained to me just how big of a problem money laundering is for banks. The smallest of compliance slip-ups can cost banks millions of dollars â fines across the industry are expected to surpass $20 billion this year.

Startups are really only as good as the money they save their customers. A simultaneously massive and rapidly increasing regulatory burden on banks is a surefire signal that financial institutions are willing to spend significant capital to abate burdensome fines.

Large banks employ thousands of screeners that spend their days combing through false positives flagged by existing tools. Even small improvements in transaction monitoring can save analysts time and make them more effective at managing risk.

With this as a driver, Cross was able to run a proof of concept test for a major bank within six months. That deal, worth seven figures, took about a year to convert to contract.

âA big challenge as youâre starting to scale is getting your sales process moving things through repeatably,â Cross told me in a very VC tone. âWeâre about to close our second bank and I would like us to do a bank a quarter.â

Rather than price gouge banks, Merlon is taking a page from Bloomberg and charging its customers on a per seat basis. The goal is that as Merlon adds new features, it will become useful to more employees at a bank, necessitating additional seats.

Cross told explained to me that the alternative of charging enterprises for individual features has generated resentment in the industry â customers donât have much power and either have to pay up or swallow a painful switch to a new provider.

Merlon uses anonymized bank data to improve its functioning. Cross says this hasnât been a concern for his initial customers because the startup never actually exports data. Ideally improved monitoring benefits every bank equally.

Moving forward, Cross says he will remain involved in the Data Collective network, helping out where he can. But with a growing startup under his wing, he will have to step back from the investing team to keep his creation on a healthy trajectory.

The team was intentional about soliciting investors that could add value in helping the startup lock down enterprise contracts with banks. In addition to Data Collective, Merlon Intelligence also counts Fenway Summer, Nyca, and Work-Bench as investors.",0

Accused Russian cybercriminal Alexander Vinniks legal odyssey continues Monday in Paris, where he faces trial on charges of extortion, money laundering and involvement in organized crime.

Its the latest milestone in a case that spans multiple countries: Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece, which extradited him to France this year with the understanding that he was also wanted in the U.S. and Russia.

French and U.S. prosecutors allege Vinnik helped create the infamous Locky ransomware and then launder the resulting bitcoin ransom payments through the BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange. French prosecutors are focusing on $157 million that the alleged scheme captured from French organizations. A U.S. indictment says he laundered as much as $4 billion while running BTC-e, which also allegedly provided services to other scams. In Russia, he faces smaller-scale charges of fraud.

Vinniks arrival in France in January followed a nearly two-year battle over where Greek authorities would send the 41-year-old, who has denied any wrongdoing and says he was only a technical consultant for BTC-e. Greek law enforcement arrested him at the behest of the U.S.

In January after he was extradited to France, Vinnik began a 35-day hunger strike saying he wanted to be extradited to Russia instead.

In June, New Zealand worked with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in freezing the equivalent of $90 million in assets belonging to Vinnik. He allegedly controlled a company registered in New Zealand called the Canton Business Corporation.

While Vinniks case landed in France, U.S. actions against alleged Russian cybercriminals have continued to gain headlines this year. In September a grand jury indicted two men for cryptocurrency fraud. In July, hacker Yevgeniy Nikulin was found guilty of stealing data from LinkedIn and Formspring and was later sentenced to about 7 years in prison. On a different but sometimes related track, federal agencies are also monitoring Russian activity as part of efforts to protect the 2020 elections.

862,"Crime statistics from the South African Police Service show that gang related murders are increasing sharply, particularly in the suburbs that make up the Cape Flats in the Western Cape. The area is the epicentre of gang activity in the country. One in every five of the 3 729 people murdered in the province between April 2017 and March 2018 were the victims of gangs.

Los Angeles in the US has a comparable gang problem. But even it has had a lower rate of gang related murders in the past three years.

Last year I concluded the first comprehensive analysis of the main law designed to deal with gang related crimes. I specifically looked at Chapter 4 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act to investigate the shortcomings of the legislation in combating gang related crimes.

My analysis uncovered several shortcomings â including issues such as sentencing and the fact that the law falls short of being specific on gang related crimes â that frustrate the prosecution and conviction of gangs.

Research findings

I found that the stateâs failure to protect the inhabitants of the Cape Flats can in great part be attributed to the failure of Chapter 4 of the law, which was enacted in 1999 to combat organised crime. That includes gang related crime.

One of the biggest problems is that the law doesnât have the power to disrupt gangsâ structures and capabilities. This is partly due to weak sentences for gang related crimes. They range between three and six years, mostly with the option of a fine. The sentences are ineffectual in deterring gang members and are also too short to disrupt the organisational structure of the gangs.

My research also highlighted the fact that low sentences were often given to high-ranking gang members or bosses, on whose orders the offences such as drug dealing, assault, robbery or murder are often committed.

This issue is worsened because the Prevention of Organised Crime Act doesnât contain any offence that is specifically aimed at gang leaders. The closest it comes to targeting them is through the provision for the crime of inducing another to commit gang activities. This carries a maximum sentence of three years, or an unspecified fine.

This is in stark contrast to crimes pertaining to managing criminal racketeering enterprises. These offences carry a R100 million fine or life imprisonment.

A further issue is that proving crimes were committed on the instruction of gang leaders is extremely difficult. Thatâs because gang leaders are mostly far removed from the actual crimes, which are executed by their subordinates. Thereâs often no evidence linking the leaders to the actual crimes, making it practically impossible for the state to prove their involvement beyond a reasonable doubt in trials.

Prosecutions based on the act are often derailed due to a lack of evidence, also because of the complex nature of the crimes.

Ineffective policing

The Western Cape government has been very vocal in claiming successes in its fight against gangs. For example, it claimed last August that its anti-crime operation had made over â11,000 arrests including high-ranking gang members on the Cape Flatsâ. This seems exorbitant, considering that the total number of people awaiting trial in the entire country during 2016 and 2017 was about 43 799.

But the public should be weary of this misleading language. Arrests donât translate into prosecutions; and prosecutions donât translate into convictions. In fact, Helen Zille, the Premier of the Western Cape, criticised the low 0,7% gang conviction rate two years ago.

The gang crisis is aggravated by the shortage of police officers in the country. In 2015 it was reported that about 85% of South African police stations were understaffed.

Another problem is the unfair allocation of police resources. In December 2018, the Equality Court found that the allocation of police resources unfairly discriminated âagainst black and poor people on the basis of race and povertyâ. Many of those under-served areas are rife with gang activity.

What can be done?

The law needs to change to provide for crimes that are simpler to prove, and include provisions that specifically target gang leaders. This should be coupled with harsher sentences.

Ensuring that gang leaders are directly accountable for the crimes committed by their subordinates would solve the problem in providing evidence in court that the crimes were committed on the bossesâ instructions. Proof that the boss controls the gang, for instance, would be enough to secure a conviction. Such models are recognised under international criminal law.

A controversial option, akin to Australiaâs New South Wales model, would be to outlaw the formation of gangs and membership. This might, however, lead to the infringement of the constitutional right to freedom of association.

None of the necessary changes will happen without real political will. The establishment of the Anti-Gang Unit in the Western Cape in late 2018 was a step in the right direction. But its true value will be reflected in actual convictions for gang-related crimes.",0
35,"The leader of El Salvadorâs Texis Cartel, Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, alias âMedio Millonâ (Half a Million), allegedly silenced a witness who knew about his criminal history in the United States.

âMedio Millonâ is under investigation for the murder of a man who witnessed crimes committed in the United States. Cisneros turned to a leader of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha, imprisoned in Zacatecoluca, to kill a man who had knowledge of Cisnerosâ illicit businesses.

Cisneros called âEl Kabraâ in the Zacatecoluca maximum security prison in early 2010, to ask him to give him the green light to move against Santos Salvador Sanchez Regalado, who had been deported to the United States and who Medio Millon had met in Massachusetts when the two men both lived there in the early 2000s. Sanchez knew too much about Cisnerosâ affairs in El Salvador and in North America. Oscar Arturo Vasquez Alfaro, alias âel Kabraâ o âDragon el Fulton,â broker for the Mara Salvatrucha Programa Fulton in El Salvador, and associate of Medio Millon, was the man to help with the job.

El Kabra and his clique proved effective. On February 3, at just before four in the afternoon, Juan Jose Chavez, aged 54, identified the body of his son, Santos Salvador Chavez Regalado, aged 26, on the main street of the BarrancÃ³n neighborhood, in the Sunapa Canton, Nueva ConcepciÃ³n.

âThe body has various entry wounds made by firearms. At the crime scene there were 9 mm shells and blood splattersâ¦Neighbors reported hearing multiple gunshots at 10:30. The deceased was driving on a 1983 Yamaha motorbike, which was yellow with blue stripes and had plates M 52-140,â read the police report, which was added to the summary prepared by the National Civil Policeâs (PNC) investigatory body in August 2010, part of the prosecutorâs investigation.

That record also contained a revelation about Cisneros Rodriguezâs past, one that has a narrow relation to the US Treasury Departmentâs recent decision to include Cisneros on the list of six MS-13 members mentioned as âobjectivesâ for American law enforcement and prosecutors. A witness who spoke to the PNC in 2010 said that Medio Millon had joined a gang involved in drug trafficking in Massachusetts between the late 1990s and the end of 2000. The witness also said that Santos Chavezâs knowledge of this was one of the reasons that El Kabraâs men killed him.

âThe witness indicates that there was communication between the two subjects Oscar Vasquez Alfaro (âel Dragon de Fultonâ) and Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez (âMedio Millonâ) about the homicide. The victim knew about the drug trafficking and extortion operations run by âEl Dragon de Fultonâ for Programa Fulton, and about the drug sales and homicides committed by âMedio Millon.â The victim knew even more about âMedio Millonâsâ drug trafficking operations when the two knew each other in Massachusetts, given that at that time âMedio MillÃ³nâ belonged to a gang that operated in that US state,â read the police report.

US state and federal authorities, along with Massachusetts district court records, attest that Cisneros lived in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2009. Local police records indicate that he was in Nantucket, an island 48 kilometers outside the port of Boston, in 1998, 2006, and 2009, and judicial records indicate that he was involved in civil cases in 2001 and 2002.

Although Massachusetts criminal court records do not indicate that there are currently proceedings open against Cisneros, police in Washington confirmed that he was a person of interest over the last decade in Boston in relation to multiple drug trafficking investigations.

A unique case

The attorney generalâs office investigated Cisneros and 34 members of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha (FLS) for the murder of Chavez Regalado, as well as five other people who received orders from El Kabra from inside Zacatecoluca prison in 2010. That was the year that âMedio MillÃ³nâ managed to escape an operation mounted to execute the arrest warrant issued by a judge for those cases, thanks to a timely warning from a deputy police inspector, say souces in the PNC, the attorney generalâs office, and US law enforcement.

Police intelligence reports on these crimes say that the majority of the victims are âmembers of the same gang, killed for having broken the rules. An example of this is the âMagalyâ case, in which a gang member asked el Kabra to greenlight the murder of another âhomieâsâ girlfriend in retaliation for betraying him. Intergang rivalry is also a frequent cause of homicides.â Only the murder of Santos Chavez, the old acquaintance from Massachusetts, has a distinct motive, according to investigators: silencing a potential witness in cases related to the United States and drug trafficking.

The leader of the hitmen, a gang member named Pedro Quintanilla, alias âEl Serio,â took advantage of the situation to recover a personal debt, says the police report. After taking the first bullets, Santos Chavez fell flat on the dusty road, a few meters from his motorbike. The gunmen arrived to finish him off. âEl Serioâ went through the victimâs pockets and found $200, which he later used to pay back a small drug debt he owned.

Medio Millon, in addition to asking his associate Oscar Arturo, El Kabra o âDragon de Fultonâ to organized the hit, also provided the arms, as he usually did: two AK-47s and five 9 mm pistols from Honduras.

271,"A solicitor jailed last year for three money laundering offences has been struck off the roll. In an outcome agreed with the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, Ross Ian McKay accepted he should be banned after he was jailed for seven years for helping fraudsters develop a multi-million-pound property portfolio.

The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal also heard McKay worked as an in-house solicitor for a company which converted money introduced by a convicted drug dealer.

McKay, from Handforth in Cheshire, was sentenced in January 2019 at Manchester Crown Court after it was heard he was gangstersâ âgo-toâ solicitor who would carry out property transactions without asking questions about where the money had come from.

Investigators said following his sentence that McKay was fully aware that transactions were being made to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

The tribunal heard that the sentencing judge, His Honour Judge Smith, said McKay worked for two clients on total purchases worth more than Â£7.3m and assisted them in the acquisition of criminal property.

McKay was responsible for more than 80 property transactions for various criminals, all of whom were subsequently convicted of offences including money laundering and fraud.

The court had heard that deposits were put down on property where the source of funds was disguised and mortgage applications used nominees instead of the names of the legitimate purchasers.

McKay, admitted in 2004, acknowledged his conviction and did not argue against his striking off. The tribunal said he had caused significant harm to the reputation of the profession and its attempts to combat money laundering. Breaches of the law happened over several years and he had direct control over matters during this period. He must also pay Â£1,450 in costs.",1
845,"What REALLY happens when an insider buys stock?

I'm talking about insider ""trading"". This is the legal kind, when insiders buy and sell company shares.

There are a lot of different reasons that may influence why an insider is buying and if you should be following their lead.

But how do you figure out what is a good insider ""buy"" and if you should be jumping in?

The key is in the secret signals.

Insiders Will Send Signals

Investors who want to get in on insider trading can simply buy what the insiders are buying.

There are plenty of lists for ""insider buys"" put out every week. But those lists don't really tell you the full story. It's simply a bunch of names and numbers of shares.

What's the REAL story behind the buy?

As the editor of the Insider Trader portfolio, I've looked at hundreds of insider buys. Patterns emerge. Insiders often give out secret signals, but you have to know what to look for.

Here are 3 of the secret signals that I use to find the diamonds in the rough of the insider trades. Find these secret signals and insider buying will no longer seem like a mystery.

3 Secret Signals to Successful Insider Trading

1) ""The Lawyer Indicator""

The General Counsel (or ""Senior Counsel"" at some companies) is the company's top lawyer and is considered part of management. Being a lawyer myself, I can tell you that lawyers are, in general, risk averse. (Sorry lawyers!)

Therefore, when it comes to buying company stock, they usually err on the side of caution. They rarely buy shares on the open market unless they're seeing something that is really great at their company.

If you see the General Counsel buying, that is a strong secret signal. I call it ""the lawyer indicator."" Buy when the lawyers are buying.

According to legendary investor Peter Lynch, when major officers buy shares of their own companies, there's only one reason: They expect the stock price to go up.

Using a proprietary strategy, Zacks Investment Research is distilling a handful of the most compelling insider stock purchases. These timely recommendations are now open to public view - but only until Sunday, November 12.

See the stocks now >>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Buy When There Are Cluster Trades

The insider buys that get the most publicity are the famous CEOs who buy, for example, $1 million worth of shares (or more) in one massive buy.

While these big buys are great, and can mean something exciting is going on at the company, I look for the complete opposite. I look for the ""cluster"" trades, where a group of insiders are all buying at the same time.

That means, for example, there may be 3 Directors, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Marketing all buying smaller amounts of shares, but all deciding to do so around the same time. This type of cluster buying is rarer than the one big buy by the CEO and sends a powerful signal.

What do they ALL know?

3) Buy If Insiders Are Jumping in For the First Time

There are some insiders who buy company shares on the open market several times a year. Some of the senior insiders, like the CEO and CFO, are usually paid at a higher level than the other senior management and buying company shares isn't much of a hardship.

But for other senior management lower down the chain, like the General Counsel or the head of Human Resources, among others, there may be a different calculation when deciding to buy that $10,000 worth of stock.

It's not unusual to see insiders who have NOT bought shares in many years, if ever, deciding to buy some shares.

The insider who has NEVER bought shares before, but is now, sends a strong signal.

I'm not talking about someone who is new at the company. This would be an insider who has worked at the company for several years and only now has decided to jump in.

What does that insider know that is different from the prior years? Why are they buying now?

And how can you take full advantage of this buying activity?

Where to Find the Best Insider Buys

Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information for a company, but it's time consuming to literally search through hundreds of individual companies.

Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you in a weekly list. Have you ever seen one of those lists? The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.

To solve this problem, our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations. We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys to find the very best.

Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks' Insider Trader.

Right now, we've narrowed it down to 10 insider buys that make the grade.

Right now, we've narrowed down to 10 insider buys that make the grade. One recent move was from a CEO who - for the first time - poured his own money ($238,800) into his company's stock. This was despite having already received over $7 million worth of the stock as part of his compensation, yet another compelling signal.

Our strategy indicates that it's time to follow this CEO and load up on shares.

251,"Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion.

A Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of failing to pay tax of around Â£584,000 on Â£2.2m of income he received after buying the failed chain for Â£1.

The court heard the 53-year-old spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday to the Bahamas.

Chappell's lawyers claimed he became ""utterly broke"" after BHS's ""pension problem exploded"" in 2015.

Mr Chappell controversially bought the retailer from tycoon Sir Philip Green that year, but the chain collapsed soon after in 2016. It led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.

Five issues at the heart of the BHS story
'I was in charge of millions, then I had nothing'

In sentencing, the judge said Chappell had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"".

""You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies,"" he said.

Simon York, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: ""This was deliberate theft from UK citizens. Chappell was a high-profile businessman who knew tax had to be paid on his income and profits but chose not to do so.

""That's money that should have been supporting our vital public services instead of funding his lavish lifestyle.""

'Struggling chain'

BHS, once one of Britain's best known retailers, was losing Â£1m a week and had a huge pension deficit when Chappell's consortium, Retail Acquisitions, bought it in 2015.

In his year of ownership Mr Chappell received Â£2.5m in payments from BHS , largely for consultancy fees provided by another of his companies, the bankrupt finance firm Swiss Rock Limited.

Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme.

However, on Thursday prosecutors condemned Chappell for spending large sums of money at a time when he should have been trying to save BHS.

""Chappell purchased the struggling retail chain for just Â£1 and was paid thousands of pounds in his new role, where he was tasked with avoiding more redundancies,"" said crown prosecutor Andrew Fox.

""Instead, while the company fell further into financial difficulty, he spent his new income lavishly on luxury breaks abroad and expensive yachts.""

'Reckless financial transactions'

The court heard Chappell, a former racing driver, also bought Â£11,000 worth of items from a gun and outdoor wear shop, including expensive Beretta firearms.

Prosecutors said HMRC repeatedly tried to chase down the missing funds, but Chappell ignored their requests, at one point going on a skiing break before asking for more time to pay the money when he returned home.

In his defence, Chappell argued he was too busy resolving issues with BHS to deal with the outstanding taxes that were due.

He had denied three charges of tax fraud.

Earlier this year Chappell was ordered to pay Â£9.5m into BHS pension schemes after losing an appeal.",1
53,"Georgia needs the port. And if it doesnât want to find itself sucked into a Chinese debt trap, it needs to stop tussling with Western investors. The arbitration filings came just days after Tbilisi backed down in another conflict with another investor, Frontera, an American oil company â under myopic pressure from Washington.

This latest escalation in the bitter public dispute over Anaklia is a blow to Georgiaâs national security for two reasons.

First, it is yet more evidence that Anaklia will not be built anytime soon; the arbitration process will make it difficult for the government to attract new investors. As the countryâs first deep-water port, Anaklia is an essential part of Georgiaâs plan to transform itself into a transit hub between Europe and Asia, a strategy intended to boost trade, integrate deeper in the Euro-Atlantic economic system, and ultimately pull Georgia out of Russiaâs sphere of influence.

The move by the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC) â which was founded by a rival to the head of Georgiaâs ruling party â came after the government blamed it for failing to raise enough money for the port and terminated its contract in January. ADC, for its part, maintains that the government made it impossible to attract investors.

The Anaklia saga also undermines Georgiaâs security by damaging its reputation as a safe place to invest. Georgian officials like to boast about their countryâs free trade agreements and high place in ease of doing business rankings. The ability to attract foreign investors not only spurs growth, it creates connections with American and European business communities and spares Georgia from having to accept predatory loans from China to build new infrastructure.

The ruling Georgian Dream party has always claimed it supports Anaklia. Behind the scenes, however, it has appeared to sabotage the project by refusing to provide guarantees to international financial institutions, and launching what smells like a politically motivated money laundering investigation against former ADC chairman Mamuka Khazaradze. Clearly there is a personal rivalry between Khazaradze, who has started his own political party, and the head of Georgian Dream, Georgiaâs de-facto leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.

The fact that such a strategically important project was derailed by domestic political squabbling does not reflect well on Georgia. Foreign firms will be less likely to invest there, especially in things like infrastructure projects which require long-term commitments. This should be a grave concern for Georgia, where FDI inflows have already fallen from an average of $1.8 billion per year between 2014 and 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019, according to government data.

Access to Western investors, businesses, and insurers â which requires those actors to believe they will be treated fairly â is a vital economic and security asset for Georgia. Investors bring more than capital and expertise; they form connections between business communities in Georgia and the West which in turn create political connections. If the steady march of bad press about Anaklia dissuades some Western firms from investing in Georgia, the country will be forced to choose between slower economic growth and new benefactors.

The obvious choice would be China, with its deep coffers and penchant for investing in dysfunctional countries along trade routes to Europe. This is not just a far-fetched hypothetical. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has cited the risk of Georgia âfalling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influenceâ as one reason Anaklia is so important. Chinese investment in Georgia would invite the same concerns about debt traps, a lack of transparency, and political influence that accompany Chinese investments everywhere.

Georgia is still a success story for democracy and free enterprise in a tough neighborhood. The Anaklia fiasco is a step backwards. Georgians must now recognize the danger of politicizing critical investments. Parliamentary elections in October are the perfect opportunity to voice support for Anaklia and for keeping their country open to foreign businesses.

Georgiaâs friends in Washington, meanwhile, should provide the kind of guidance that is based on principle, not favoritism. In April, Georgia prevailed in an arbitration dispute with Frontera, the American oil company, which the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration found had failed to pay wages and engaged in other unscrupulous behavior over the years. Instead of supporting Georgiaâs efforts to move on, some members of Congress (who took contributions from Frontera), tried to get the State Department to withhold aid to Tbilisi, tying â improbably â the Frontera dispute to Russia. Tbilisi had no choice but to cave.

Thatâs how Beijing and Moscow do business. If Washington wants Georgia to succeed as a transparent and free democracy, it should support the countryâs efforts to play by the rules â and support negotiations with the Anaklia Development Consortium.",0

A US lawyer has been found guilty for his role in the OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, which raised billions of pounds from investors convinced they were buying into a new digital currency.

A New York jury found that Mark Scott helped to perpetrate the scheme, routing approximately $400m (Â£310m) out of the US while working to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds.

Prosecutors said he made about $50m.

Mr Scott's lawyers had said he did not know that OneCoin was worthless.

They said he was simply doing the job asked by Dr Ruja Ignatova, a co-founder of the Bulgaria-based OneCoin.

The federal jury in Manhattan rejected those arguments, finding Mr Scott guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud.

Dr Ignatova's brother, who testified in the case, also recently pleaded guilty for his role in the fraud.

US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case.

In total, investigators believe as much as Â£4bn was raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK among other countries.

""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys said in one filing.

""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand.""

Dr Ignatova, an ex-McKinsey consultant, disappeared from view around October 2017. There has not been a confirmed sighting since.

However, the Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing.

""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,"" it said in a recent statement given to The Missing Cryptoqueen, a BBC podcast.

It added: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully proceedings against OneCoin. We are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a financial revolution will be established.""",1
8,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero, a major Mexican narcotics trafficker and fugitive from U.S. justice for his role in the murder of an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Caro Quintero was identified as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) in 2000. Each entity designated today is owned or controlled by one or more individuals previously designated because they act on behalf of Caro Quintero.

âTodayâs designation demonstrates the enormous extent to which Rafael Caro Quintero and his family members have infiltrated the economy in Guadalajara, Mexico, including the real estate and gasoline retail sectors,â said Treasuryâs Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. âWith Caro Quintero on the run, OFAC will continue to work with the DEA and our Mexican counterparts to expand the sanctions against any person or entity that acts on behalf of this murderous criminal.â

Caro Quintero began his criminal career in the late 1970s when he co-founded the Guadalajara drug cartel and amassed an illicit fortune. Caro Quintero was the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of DEA Special Agent (SA) Enrique Camarena in 1985. Following his capture in the same year, Caro Quintero was convicted in Mexico for his involvement in SA Camarenaâs murder and received a 40-year prison sentence. However, on August 9, 2013, Caro Quintero was released from a Mexican prison with 12 years remaining on his sentence.

âWe are reminded every day of the ultimate sacrifice paid by Special Agent Enrique Camarena and DEA will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro Quintero faces justice in the United States for the crimes he committed,â said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. âCaro Quintero and his organization can no longer hide behind front companies with their drug trafficking profits. These illegal enterprises fuel the drug trade and its violence and corruption. DEA and our partners at Treasury and elsewhere in government will pursue any and all means available to ensure that Caro Quintero is brought to justice and his criminal network is destroyed.â

While in prison, Caro Quintero continued his alliance with Mexican drug trafficking organizations and used a network of family members and front persons to invest his illicit fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. OFAC designated 18 of these individuals, including six of Caro Quinteroâs family members, and 15 entities on June 12, 2013.

Caro Quintero is wanted in the Central District of California on criminal charges related to the kidnapping and murder of SA Camarena as well as drug trafficking. The U.S. government is seeking Caro Quinteroâs arrest to face these charges.

Todayâs action, which designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero pursuant to the Kingpin Act, generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these designees, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

This action targeted 20 companies primarily located in or near Guadalajara. Several of these companies are engaged in real estate activities, including Arrendadora Turin, Barsat, and Villas del Colli. Others are gasoline retailers or engaged in agricultural activities, including Petro London, Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, and Minerales Nueva Era, which produces and sells an organic fertilizer known as Diatomag as well as an organic pesticide known as Diatomkill.

Also designated today is Juan Carlos Soto Ruiz, a Guadalajaran native who plays a key management role in six of the companies designated today, including Arrendadora Turin and Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, as well as three of the companies designated on June 12, 2013, including Pronto Shoes (a.k.a. CX-Shoes).

Since June 2000, the President has identified 103 drug kingpins, and OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals, pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation, to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

421,"(Yicai Global) June 24 -- The China Securities Regulatory Commission has made use of the countrys Beidou Navigation and Positioning System to pinpoint Chinese scalloper Zoneco Groups movements in the sea and finally expose the true extent of its accounting fraud.

Dalian-based Zoneco, one of Chinas largest seafood suppliers, has been slapped with a CNY600,000 (USD84,750) fine for alleged information disclosure violations and its chairman, Wu Hougang, banned from the securities market for life, the CSRC said today.

Fifteen people involved in the scam were also each fined between CNY30,000 to CNY300,000, and four people were given five-year to lifelong market bans, it added.

The financial statements of the firm have come under intense scrutiny in recent years after a succession of huge, fishy losses. In October 2014 Zoneco said it had scrapped CNY800 million (USD113 million) in scallop stocks. In January 2018 it claimed a shortage of food had starved CNY630 million worth of the shellfish to death. Another CNY300 million worth mysteriously perished last year.

It is extremely difficult to know how many of these bottom dwellers are available in a specific area of the sea as they are cannot be seen with the naked eye. It was only through the use of top of the range technology, including Big Data and cloud computing, that the CSRC were able to expose Zonecos fraud.

By analyzing the satellite positioning of the companys fishing boats, the CSRC was able to discover the true extent of the fishing area covered by Zoneco over the last two years, and to substantiate that Zoneco had doctored its financial data, including costs, non-operating expenses and profits, the Shanghai Securities Journal reported.

Zoneco's stock price [SHE:002069] closed down 1.29 percent today at CNY3.06 (USD0.43), with a market cap of CNY2.2 billion (USD310.8 million).",1
139,"John Kapoor, the founder and former chief executive officer of Insys Therapeutics, has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for the role his company played in the opioid epidemic. Kapoor is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be held liable for the increasing opioid crisis.

Kapoor was found guilty in May 2019 of orchestrating kickback schemes to encourage doctors to boost prescriptions of Subsys, a powerful pain killer. For his role in that plan, Kapoor was sentenced to 66 months in prison Thursday afternoon. Prosecutors had hoped Kapoor, 76, would receive about 15 years in prison but Kapoorâs defense team had requested only one year in prison due to Kapoorâs advanced age. When U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs announced the sentencing, she said she arrived at the 66 months sentence due to Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as ""his central role in the crime,â NPR reported, citing The Associated Press.

During the sentencing, several patients spoke about the suffering they went through after being prescribed high doses of Subsys from the doctors who were paid by Insys, the AP said. Some of the patients said the drug made their teeth fall out and also left them with memory loss. There were also stories of becoming addicted to opioids due to the doctors pushing the drug on them. One woman, Deborah Fuller, told the court about her daughter who died of an overdose at the age of 32, the AP said.

Kapoor offered an apology at the sentencing. He said he was â heartbroken by the words of the patientsâ who spoke at both the sentencing and his trial.

U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling told reporters following the sentencing that he objected to the lesser sentence.

âMy view is that the public interest demanded higher sentences for these defendants,â Lelling said, according to the AP. âThese guys basically took a publicly traded pharma company and turned it into an engine for corrupting doctors and jeopardizing the health of men and women nationwide.â

Kapoorâs sentencing comes days after his colleague, Michael J. Gurry, the former Vice President of Managed Markets, was sentenced to 33 months for his role in the Subsys scheme. Kapoor, Gurry and other Insys executives, including Richard M. Simon, the former National Director of Sales; Sunrise Lee, a former Regional Sales Director; and Joseph A. Rowan, a former Regional Sales Director; were found guilty of violating the RICO Act, for their role in the kickback schemes to boost prescriptions of Subsys, which was approved to treat the pain many cancer patients exhibit. On Thursday, Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role, NPR reported.

During the trials, the government showed that Kapoor and his sales team used data to identify practitioners who either prescribed unusually high volumes of rapid-onset opioids or had demonstrated a capacity to do so. Once they were identified, the sales team went to work to increase the number of new Subsys prescriptions, and to increase the dosage and number of units of Subsys, the government said. The kickbacks were often noted as âspeaker fees.â Additionally, the Insys team conspired to defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients, the government said. Prosecutors said Insys misled insurers regarding the true diagnosis of a patient in order to get approval for Subsys, which was to be prescribed to cancer patients.

Throughout the trial, sordid details of the methods used to persuade the prescribers were brought to light, including having an Insys sales manager perform a lap dance at a Chicago strip club for a doctor the company was trying to woo. Jurors were also introduced to a video from a 2015 sales conference of sales associates dancing with a giant bottle of the addictive fentanyl-based Subsys in a rap music video.

Kapoor will report to prison on March 5.",1
597,"As the biggest corruption scandal Brazil has ever seen continues to ensnare the countrys top political and business elites, potentially damning testimony by a former ally tightens the net surrounding President Dilma Rousseff.

Former senator Delcídio do Amaral has claimed that Rousseff and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are directly involved in a widespread corruption case centered around state-owned oil giant Petrobras.

The developments are part of so-called  Operation Car Wash   which is investigating a bribery and kickback scandal involving Petrobras executives and suppliers that has cost the company billions of dollars, part of which was allegedly funneled into Rousseff and da Silvas Workers Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores  PT).

SEE ALSO: Coverage of Elites and Organized Crime

In an interview with Veja magazine, Amaral said that da Silva, popularly known as Lula, ran the scheme and that Rousseff inherited it when she took office in 2011. Dilma also knew everything, he told Veja. The difference is she pretended to have nothing to do with the case.

Amaral was arrested for alleged involvement in the Petrobras scandal in November 2015. He previously said that Rousseff and Lula were aware of the Petrobras kickback scheme in testimony to prosecutors, as part of a plea bargain (see his plea agreement here  pdf).

During his testimony to prosecutors, Amaral also accused President Rousseff of obstructing justice by appointing a sympathetic judge to the Supreme Court. Amaral said the judge blocked an arrest and facilitated the release of suspects implicated in the Petrobras case.

Rousseffs former chief of staff and current minister of education offered Amaral bribes to keep quiet about the scandal, the ex-senator told prosecutors.

Amarals testimony is the first time Rousseff has been directly linked to the scandal, the Wall Street Journal reported, while Lula has previously been detained for questioning.

Both Rousseff and Lula deny the allegations against them, while Rousseff has moved to sue Amaral for what the presidents office described as defamatory statements.

InSight Crime Analysis

Senator Amarals allegations are extremely damaging to a government that has been rocked to the core by scandal, as well as an ongoing economic crisis. However, the verdict is still out on whether the growing Petrobras corruption case has the potential to topple the presidency.

It is notoriously difficult to bring members of Brazils political and business elite to justice, although the recent sentencing of top businessman Marcelo Odebrecht to 19 years in prison as part of Operation Car Wash suggests this trend of impunity may be changing.

Public opinion in Brazil seems to be squarely against Rousseff and Lula, given the scale of anti-government protests in recent days. According to a recent poll by Datafolha, 68 percent of people questioned believe that Rousseff should be impeached. Such a motion can only pass if both the Senate and the lower house of Brazils Congress vote to impeach Rousseff with a two-thirds majority, analyst Daniel Caplin of the consulting firm S-RM previously told InSight Crime.",1
765,"Any law to curb online terrorism must strike the right balance between security and fundamental right to freedom of expression, says the leader of the Socialists and Democrats Iratxe GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez.

During the plenary debate on terrorism, the right to freedom of expression and education, the S&Ds leader underlines that âthe recent terrorist attacks in France and in Austria fill us with sadness and our thoughts and solidarity are with all the victims and their families. But terrorists will never win in their fight to undermine our democracies founded on freedom and opennessâ.

âOn the contrary: we will fight them with our principles,â she pointed out.

âWe cannot give up on the fundamental principles of freedom of expression and freedom of education. Europe would not exist without them and they are fundamental principles of our Union. We cannot let fanatics divide us. We have to face the terrorist threat united in our diversity, using the Rule of Law to respond. We must also tackle terrorist content on social media, because it has become a powerful took to radicalise, intimidate and recruit. That is why the S&D Group is working hard in the European Parliament to adopt rules for social media companies to act swiftly and remove all terrorist content posted online while respecting fundamental principles,â she added.

âHowever, any proposal must strike that complex but essential balance between free and open societies and security. Some seem to have some interest in diverting attention and speaking about border controls within Schengen. When Home Affairs ministers meet on Friday to discuss the fight against terrorism, they should focus on preventing radicalisation, improving cooperation and information exchange and steer well clear of a misleading debate on border controls in the Schengen area. Some voices continue to make a deceptive link between migration and terrorism, and in doing so undermine one the EUâs greatest freedoms and greatest achievements.â",0
580,"The coal scam, or whats popularly called the coalgate, first came to light when Indias audit watchdog, The Comptroller and Auditor General of India, raised the issue of inadequacies in the allocation of coal blocks from 2004 onwards. It created a political storm, as the loss to the exchequer was initially pegged at over Rs. 10 lakh crore. The final report scaled it down to Rs. 1.86 lakh crore.

CAGs criticism was that though the government had decided to allot coal blocks through a system of competitive bidding, what it ended up following was a method that was opaque and subjective. Further, its point was, there was no legal impediment in introducing a more transparent process. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that coal blocks allocated by the government between 1993 and 2010 were illegal.

932,"But something baffling arises when one compares the number published by the central government with those published by provincial authorities. By April 29, all of the 31 provincial governments had released economic statistics. Among them, in all defiance of the law of averages, no single province claimed a real GDP growth rate lower than the nationwide number. What gives?

Although apparently surprising, the contradiction between the national and provincial data is nothing more than a continuation of a long-time trend. In 2012, the real GDP growth rates released by all provincial authorities except Beijing and Shanghai exceeded 7.8 percent, the nationwide figure.

In 1985, the national statistics bureau and provincial statistic agencies were separated into two non-interfering systems. Since then, economic data from each province have been gathered and calculated by each provincial agency independently. The national bureau has been charged only with accounting for national economic data, without relying on data briefed by each province. Since 1985, a discrepancy between national and provincial data has been continuously widening. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the sum of GDP figures released by all provincial agencies outnumbered the figure from the national bureau by 2.68 trillion RMB (US$430 billion), 3.5 trillion RMB and 4.6 trillion RMB, respectively. In 2012, the gap grew to 5.73 trillion RMB, approximately 11 percent of China's national GDP.

This discrepancy is partially explained by technicalities. When collecting primary data, the central bureau and provincial agencies sometimes use different basic ""reference point"" data and statistical calibrations. Second, certain inter-provincial economic activities are claimed by all the provinces involved, leading to double counting.

Yet it is hardly possible that technical errors alone can account for such a consistent, substantial, and ever-growing discrepancy. Chinese media and citizens have inevitably speculated that economic data have been artificially modified.

Part of this skepticism traces to the incentive system for Chinese officials. Economic performance is still used as a major criterion for the evaluation and promotion of provincial bureaucrats. This leaves economic statistics particularly subject to political manipulation to serve officials' personal interest. As @ xuehanbo observes on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter, ""The reason why the data published by provincial agencies are falsely high is actually simple: the local authorities are still crazy for GDP growth, which is the key standard used to appraise officials' performance."" During a meeting in April 2012, Ma Jiantang, chief of the National Statistics Bureau, explicitly admitted that data fabrication has been the major source of statistical distortion.

In order to solve the problem, the National Statistics Bureau has proposed several initiatives to reform the bifurcated statistical reporting system. In 2004, the Bureau proposed to monitor all economic data reported by provincial agencies. In 2006 and again in 2011, the Bureau advocated for the merger of the separate systems and offered to take direct charge of provincial economic statistics reporting.

Yet none of these proposed initiatives has been turned into sustained practice. For one, the root cause of statistical corruption would not have been eliminated with reforms. Since the current system of evaluation and promotion of officials provides the primary incentive for statistical manipulation, it is in fact this system that needs to be changed. An recent editorial by the Beijing Youth Daily (@ ?????) suggests as much:

There is only one way to end the contradiction between provincial and national GDP statistics: to reform the official evaluation system and increase citizens' say in the process so that local authorities are not responsible for GDP growth alone, but also the environment, high-quality public services, and sustainable development. Only then will there be hope of freeing ourselves from the awkward GDP fights between localities and the central government.",1
950,"As the date for the referendum on the UKs membership of the EU approaches, the focus of debate has settled on the impact that so-called Brexit would have on security, the economy and immigration.

For the financial crime-combating community, the question of Brexit brings together two of these issues: security and the economy  or, more precisely, the issue of fighting crime and the position of the UK as the leading international global financial centre. The latter point has received much media coverage, with most current practitioners in the financial sector expressing a preference to remain part of the EU given the benefits that accrue to locating a financial services business within the EU and passporting activity seamlessly into the other member states without incurring further regulatory impediments. The former issue  security/crime-fighting  has also been widely discussed by politicians and former security and intelligence leaders in broad terms; however, the impact that Brexit would have on tackling financial crime has so far been neglected.

The UK has, over the past two years, placed considerable national security emphasis on the importance of tackling financial and economic crime. The recently published Action Plan for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance reiterates the governments commitment to protecting the security and prosperity of citizens and the integrity of Britains world-leading financial system by vigorously pursuing those who abuse it for illicit means. It therefore seems right to question the extent to which this commitment would be affected by the UKs exit from the EU.

It would seem that, prima facie, leaving the EU would be entirely negative for the UKs efforts to tackle financial crime (including terrorist financing) for the simple reason that, given the globalised nature of finance, tackling the associated crime needs more, not less partnership. The former heads of the Security Service and of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI5 and MI6) have drawn attention to the importance of the cross-border data sharing within the EU on which the UK relies to help reveal the associations and activities of terrorists and cyber-attackers. This co-operation is equally imperative for combating the financing of such malevolent actors and identifying those that perpetrate extortion, money laundering and corruption.

Finance is a highly globalised industry. Payments, particularly those associated with corruption, trade-based money laundering and sanctions circumvention, are necessarily transnational and can only be disrupted if information can be exchanged between nations and financial institutions efficiently. As evidenced by the hand-wringing of international leaders after each of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe and further afield, accomplishing arrangements for the sharing of information is a challenging task. Lack of trust and different cultural approaches to  and legal positions on  data privacy frustrate, at the best of times, the sharing of information to disrupt all forms of crime and terrorism, including financial crime and the financing of terrorism.

Of course, Brexiters will retort that many of the structures created to combat financial crime and terrorist financing are themselves global and are thus unrelated to EU membership. First among these is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance. The UK is, in its own right, a leading member of this group of 35-member jurisdictions and two regional organisations, and it would continue to benefit from the FATFs work regardless of its status within the EU.

Likewise, the UK Financial Intelligence Units membership of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units would be unaffected by Brexit, as would the UKs membership of the G20 and G7, other bodies that busy themselves with matters related to financial crime and terrorist financing. Similarly, the status of the UK banks that are members of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of thirteen global banks which aims to develop frameworks and guidance for the management of financial crime risks, would also be unaffected by Brexit, since their membership is a function of their size and global importance. Yet most of these structures are focused on policy, not the operational reality of disrupting financial crime, which requires close, cross-border co-operation and information sharing.

As with everything currently discussed within the Brexit debate, the interconnectedness of the UK with other EU member states means that it is simply impossible to walk away from the EU and not continue to feel the impact of its rules and regulations. The recent Schrems case provides a timely reminder that non-EU countries data privacy laws must be  essentially equivalent  to EU law if data is to be shared with a country outside the EU. In that case, an Austrian citizen, Maximillian Schrems, argued that  contrary to the view laid out in a 2000 European Commission directive  the US did not comply with the EUs data protection standards. The European Court of Justice found that, given the 2013 Snowden revelations, the Commissions directive was now invalid. Given the significant financial links between the UK and the rest of the EU  both for business and for tackling financial crime  it is hard to imagine that the UK would risk breaking critical information-sharing links by turning its back on Brussels-derived data protection regulation, even though this regulation at times frustrates the UK governments efforts to widen its own data sharing and surveillance powers. So if the UK wants to maintain its information-sharing links it must abide by EU data protection regulation, yet leaving the EU would mean having no say in the development of this regulation.

The value of EU membership for fighting crime, particularly cross-border crime, has been well argued: it provides civil judicial co-operation measures; it provides access to EU police and criminal justice tools that ensure effective collective action and also grants access to European criminal records information. In addition to these general crime-related procedures and agreements, EU membership also gives the UK access to specific financial crime-fighting systems such as FIU.net and other initiatives run by Europol.

While some might welcome escaping the clutches of allegedly  bizarre  EU legislation such as the 4th Money Laundering Directive, which advocates greater scrutiny of domestic politicians, the globalised nature of finance and the necessarily cross-border nature of efforts to respond to associated criminality mean that  at a time when the sharing of information to combat financial crime and terrorist financing is an international imperative  any action that reduces the UKs ability to participate in information-sharing mechanisms and forums would seem counter-intuitive.

For those tasked with tackling financial crime and fulfilling the UK governments pledge to make the country a more hostile place for those seeking to move, hide or use the proceeds of crime and corruption or to evade sanctions, Brexit would be a significantly retrograde step.",0

558,"(CNN) The idea of a private border wall started with a GoFundMe campaign that rapidly raked in more than $20 million. Now prosecutors accuse former top Trump aide Steve Bannon and others tied to the project of defrauding donors and pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses.

It's the latest development in a project that's spurred controversy since its inception, while drawing millions of dollars of support and endorsements from many Trump allies.

Here's a look at some of the key events that have unfolded since the project began in 2018:

The campaign begins

Brian Kolfage, a triple amputee and Air Force veteran, starts a GoFundMe campaign in December 2018 saying ""political inaction"" has inspired him to raise private funds for a border wall. Within days, the project raises more than $20 million dollars.

Construction starts

The nonprofit created in connection with the campaign, ""We Build the Wall,"" announces in May 2019 it has broken ground on its first private border wall project in Sunland Park, New Mexico. ""Buckle up, we're just getting started,"" the group says in a Facebook post. Organizers say the private wall is about a mile long.

Ordered to 'cease and desist'

Days later, city officials order construction to ""cease and desist,"" stating that proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage calls the order ""political intimidation.""

Dispute with a federal agency

The next month a federal agency forces open a gate in the new, privately constructed border wall, arguing proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage slams the commission, accusing the agency of overreaching its authority.

A wall on the Rio Grande

Contractor Fisher Industries begins work on a three-mile stretch of private border wall in November 2019. It's located on a sugar cane farm in Mission, Texas, along the Rio Grande. Kolfage tells CNN that We Build the Wall provided $1.5 million for that project, describing that as 9% of the total cost.

The project is temporarily halted after being sued by federal prosecutors and the National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre wild butterfly habitat near the project's location, but later is allowed to resume. Fisher's method of building just feet from the Rio Grande becomes a point of contention, in part because of the potential for flooding and damage to surrounding property.

A new proposal

Interviews and correspondence obtained exclusively by CNN in February 2020 show that We Build the Wall had been communicating with the Trump administration about plans to build a wall along the southern border and donate it to the US government.

Reports of erosion

As a part of its lawsuit over the private project, the butterfly center says it documented erosion at the base of the Texas wall in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna in July 2020. Photos viewed by CNN show cracks in the ground between the wall and the river.

""We've got another storm headed this way. If a 'Category 1' already caused so much damage, I hate to see what this next storm is going to do,"" says Javier Peña, a lawyer for the center.

In response to allegations of erosion, Kolfage in August 2020 .

New York federal prosecutors charge Kolfage, Bannon and two others in August 2020 with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of the border wall fundraising campaign. Bannon, Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

390,"There are several documents and minutes of meetings held by shareholders of Global Medical Response of India Limited, which mention these investments made in Ziqitza.

A company registered by Appleby in tax haven Mauritius invested in an Indian firm that is at the heart of a probe by CBI and ED into what is called the Rajasthan Ambulance scam. One of the founders of the firm is the son of Congress leader and former Union minister Vayalar Ravi.

Global Medical Response of India Limited was registered in Mauritius on March 26 2008 by Appleby and classified as high risk profile. Reason: The company, earlier called Radec X Ltd, invested in Indian firm Ziqitza Health Care Limited which is under scrutiny of investigative agencies. Ziqitza provides ambulance services.

There are several prominent politicians named in the complaint, which was first filed by the Rajasthan police in 2014, immediately after the BJP returned to power in the state, and later by the CBI in 2015. They are: former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot; Karti Chidambaram, son of former finance minister P Chidambaram; former Union minister Sachin Pilot; and, Ravi Krishna, son of former Union minister Vayalar Ravi, who is also one of the founders of the company.

Records of the Registrar of Companies show that for the financial year ending March 31, 2016, among others, Ravi Krishna remains listed as an equity shareholder. In April this year, the ED attached properties worth Rs 12 crore in connection with the scam in which the CBI alleged that the company had made illegal gains of Rs 23 crore between the years 2010 and 2013.

The allegations made by the agencies are that tenders for the contracts given under the NRHM (National Rural Health Mission) were tweaked to favour Ziqitza Health Care Limited and of subsequently generating fictitious claims and invoices, and of making claims on behalf of non-operated ambulances and faking multiple trips.
The ED charged the company with provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Applebys internal documents show, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Mauritius, on September 17, 2015, red-flagged this probe.

EXPLAINED: Why the Paradise Papers matter

This is also echoed in a 2016 Compliance Review Report by Appleby which contains a flowchart of the antecedents of the company. It shows that the company was originally incorporated in 2008 as RADEC X Ltd and, in 2010, the name was changed to Global Medical Response of India Limited. The company is ultimately owned by Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Compliance report notes how ED traced the investment pattern in Ziqitza and that among the companies that invested in it through equity and preference share purchases are Grand Global Impex of Singapore; Acumen Fund Inc of US and, finally, Global Medical Response of India Ltd of Mauritius.

Says Applebys memo dated January 27, 2016: The hits (negative searches) relate to the scam involving the Companys investee company Ziqitza Health Care Limited.

There are several documents and minutes of meetings held by shareholders of Global Medical Response of India Limited, which mention these investments made in Ziqitza. Records show that a sum of $2.09 million was invested by Global Medical Response of India in Ziqitza Healthcare Limited as 1,000 ordinary shares (0.3% shareholding) and 43,184 Series B Preference shares (61.7% shareholding of Ziqitza Healthcare Limited). But in documents filed with Appleby, this payment of $2.09 million is shown as loan payable to Global Medical Response Inc.

After the CBI action, both Karti Chidambaram and Sachin Pilot distanced themselves from the deal. Karti Chidambaram told The Indian Express: I was briefly a Non Executive Independent Director with the company and have never been a share holder. And as far as I know Ziqitza Health Care never had any off shore operations. A company with off shore operations may have invested in them.

For his part, Sachin Pilot said that once the company changed its status from a non-profit venture to a for-profit venture, he resigned from it and did so before he became a Member of Parliament in 2004. He said: For under a year I was a Honorary Director with the company. This was in 2001. When they informed me that they have become a for profit company I resigned. I have never held a share in it, held a board meeting or signed any papers.

Response from Ravi Krishna

We at Ziqitza Heath Care look at Global Medical Response (GMR) as out strategic investor and yes, they set up GMR India, a separate company in Mauritius. They simply bought a company of-the-shelf and changed its name to GMR India. After all, any company would look at the most efficient way of allocating its resources.

The fact that we have a strategic investor in the Mauritius based company was disclosed by Ziqitza Health Care to the Reserve Bank of India and all banking details and details of RBI permits have subsequently been given by us to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and later, the Enforcement Directorate (ED). All the cases took off when the Government changed and in August 2015, the case went to CBI. The ED action came a month later but my point is: since we have done no wrong, how long will they prosecute us? No charge sheets have been filed and in fact, no one has even been questioned by the ED as yet.

As far as the links of other politicians with Ziqitza Health Care is concerned, both Sachin Pilot and Karti Chidambaram were only independent directors in the company, never shareholders. In fact, Sachin Pilot was associated with the company for only a few months. I myself started with a 25% stake in the company. This later reduced to 11% and now it is only 2% but this is due to personal reasons and a family division of assets.

GMR of India Limited, Mauritius is a 100% subsidiary of GMR Inc (Global Medical Response Inc; http://www.gmr.net/), the global arm of AMR Inc (American Medical Response Inc; https://www.amr.net/home/ national), worlds and USs Largest Ambulance Service Company. They are still part of Envision Health Care Inc (EVHC; https://www.evhc.net/), a New York Stock Exchange company and part of S&P500 with todays market cap of USD 3.29 billion. Kindly note that a public announcement of the sale of AMR (American Medical Response Inc) Division to KKR has been made by EVHC on August 8, 2017. We do not have any details of this deal except from the media and await the AMR / GMR management to brief us in the next board meeting. Pls see the relevant media releases:

GMR Inc connected with ZHL in 2008/09 since when they started following us. Post a due diligence in 2009/10, they invested USD 2.00 million in Series B Fund Raise of ZHL. They chose to invest through a Mauritius aubsidiary for reasons best known to them. We had no say, no recommendation or no guidance to them in this regard. The name of the entity which was bringing in the investment was RADEC X Ltd, Mauritius but the name of this entity was changed to GMR of India Limited on 26 March, 2010 itself (though we are given to understand that it seems to have taken several more days / weeks for all paperwork in this regard to be completed by them in Mauritius).",1
754,"Banks in Cyprus are concerned that their adoption of some of the toughest anti-money laundering regulations in the world has not been fully recognized abroad, the chief of the Association of Cyprus Banks said Monday.

Association Director Michalis Kammas said that banks are challenging ""outdated perceptions"" and are working to raise awareness about reform efforts.

Kammas says more rigorous supervision and directives have led to the closure of a ""significant number"" of bank accounts since 2014.

""Today, Cypriot banks' procedures encompass some of the most advanced banking compliance practices globally,"" Kammas told the Associated Press in an email.

Kammas said international supervisory bodies like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Transparency International have recognized Cyprus' strong efforts but that the message hadn't gotten through to some stakeholders, including the media.

Prior to a 2013 banking sector crisis that brought Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy, the east Mediterranean island nation, which is an EU member, was hounded by allegations that it was a tax and money laundering haven.

Kammas said the crisis hit home with Cypriot authorities that they had to clean up the banking system and that pressure to do so had come ""as much from political commitment within as it has from outside authorities.""

He said Cyprus is working closely with foreign supervisory authorities from the EU and the U.S. to ensure that financial sector legislation is fully in line with international best practices.

Some of the key reforms include obligatory face-to-face meetings between banks and account owners and strong regulations on disclosing the individual who is the ultimate holder of a bank account.

Earlier this year, Cyprus also introduced new shell company regulations that prohibit Cypriot banks from doing business with entities that are identified as shell companies.",0
730,"In late September, Joe Tone, the young editor of the Dallas Observer, broke the news to his staff that they would soon be moving offices. But they wouldnât be going far, just four floors down in their building on the corner of Oak Lawn and Maple. In his pleasant, Midwestern way, he explained that the paper was moving to distance itself from Backpage.com, the classified ad site owned by the Observerâs parent company. That company, Village Voice Media, was based in Phoenix, but Backpage.com, which has been associated with prostitution and underage sex trafficking, was based right here in Dallas, where it ran operations just down the hall from Toneâs office.

In a blog post that went live at 12:14 am on Monday, September 24, he offered more details about the move: âThe longtime owners of the Dallas Observer have sold the paper and its 12 Village Voice Media sister publications to a group of VVM executives, creating a new holding company and cutting ties with Backpage.com, the controversial classified advertising company. So: we have new owners, but the same old bosses.â The new company, based in Denver, is called Voice Media Group.

The âlongtime ownersâ Tone referred to are Mike Lacey and his business partner Jim Larkin, who founded Phoenix New Times in 1970 and grew it into Village Voice Media, the nationâs largest chain of alternative weeklies. (Disclosure: I worked as a staff writer for VVM for three and a half years.) Lacey is a charismatic but prickly man, known for his colorful language, his love of Scotch, and his unwillingness to back down from a fight. He once went to jail as part of a long battle against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

But it seemed the prostitution ads on Backpage.com, which have run in the Observer for years, had generated too much bad press and forced too many national advertisers to sever their ties with VVM. âBackpage.com has been a distraction, thereâs no doubt about it,â Scott Tobias, head of the new Voice Media Group, told the Wall Street Journal. But the site was also too profitable to let go. The âadultâ section of Backpage.com brings in an estimated $22 million a year. It appeared Lacey had decided to get out of the journalism business in favor of the sex business. He cast the move in different terms. In the few interviews he did after the separation announcement, he said his decision to sell the papers but keep Backpage.com was a âFirst Amendment issue.â

Backpage.com started in 2004. Itâs the brainchild of a former Observer classified ad salesman named Carl Ferrer, a shadowy figure who cannot be seen or interviewed by reporters. (Liz McDougall, general counsel for Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC, would confirm nothing about the creator of Backpage.com, even his name, saying itâs for his own safety and âso he can focus on the business.â) The site is a person-to-person marketplace, similar to Craigslist. Backpage.com offers an adult section, with categories such as âescorts,â âbody rubs,â âstrippers & strip clubs,â and âadult jobs.â While plenty of the ads are placed by willing, adult women, the site has also been used by pimps to peddle women, some of them underage.

When Craigslist shut down its adult listings in 2010, after a serial killer used the site to lure victims, Backpage.com thrived, eventually accounting for a reported 70 percent of all prostitution ads in the country. There are now listings for every state in America and for countries on every continent except Antarctica.

The trouble for Backpage.com really began earlier this year, when New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote a series of articles excoriating the site. Kristof, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting on human rights violations in China and genocide in Africa, documented the case of a girl who had been sold as a sex slave on the site when she was 16 years old. Then he pressured VVMâs financiers (including Goldman Sachs) and national advertisers (including Warner Bros., Disney, and Target) to cut ties with the company until Backpage.com agreed to remove the escort ads.

Representatives from VVM tried to make the case that removing the ads would drive the online escort business underground and offshore, making it even more dangerous for the women and children most at risk. But a national campaign sprang up with an online petition that collected 200,000 signatures from people demanding that the ads come down. A website called Village Voice Pimps began documenting dozens of sex trafficking cases nationwide that involved Backpage.com. Activists emailed media outlets across the country with lists of local advertisers that had agreed to stop placing ads in VVM papers.
The company felt the pinch, and by the end of the summer, VVM was laying off writers across its chain of papers.

When the sale of the papers was announced, something strange happened. The management buyout, readers were told, was backed by a private equity fund. But how much money was involved and, more important, who was involvedâthose details were kept private. If VVM was losing ad revenue because of its ownership of Backpage.com, then it stands to reason that part of the value of the fundâs investment in the weekly papers lies in recapturing that money. And the best way to do that would be to make it plain that the new owners are, in fact, new. Shrouding the private equity fund in secrecy only invites speculation. Andrea Powell, the executive director of FAIR Girlsâan organization that helps at-risk girls, including some trafficked on Backpage.comâhas called the sale âa smoke-and-mirrors effortâ on national television. Too, it is rare for media outlets to not reveal their ownership simply because every hard-hitting story would be open to the criticism that it was written to further the interests of a secret, faceless owner.

Before the split, VVM tried to make its case to outside reporters. Now the entire organizationâboth sides of itâhas become tight-lipped. Through their attorney, Lacey and Larkin have declined interviews. Tone said he couldnât comment, instead deferring to a public relations woman in New York; she would only say that all the financials are âa private matter.â Tobias, who is in charge of the Observerâs new ownership group, would only answer questions over email. When asked why his company isnât being transparent about its new sources of income, he replied with a canned statement that read, in part: âThis was a business decision involving two companies who realized they have two separate missionsâone in news and entertainment and one focused exclusively in digital classifiedsâand both are better off focusing on those separate missions.â

Interestingly enough, hours after the split was announced, Village Voice Pimps posted some new information on its site. The group had found the trademark registration for the new Voice Media Group logo. It was registered in Julyâtwo months before the saleâto Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC. That means the logo of the new supposedly independent company is owned by Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.

Thereâs also this: for all the things Lacey is known forâthe drinking, the rabble-rousingâthe 64-year-old multimillionaire is also known for the ink on his hands. Across his knuckles are tattooed the words âHOLD FAST.â",1
435,"The rise of Monzo has been nothing short of remarkable. Rave reviews from customers who universally loved its app-based banking, plus awards and glowing write-ups from the likes of Which?, helped it to become the UKs fastest-growing bank. But what has led to so many customers claiming they have been badly let down after Monzo froze their account for no apparent reason? Others claim the bank has refused to refund fraudulently taken payments.

In the past few months, complaints from previously happy Monzo customers appear to have grown alarmingly, at a time when the bank is trying to get more people to go full Monzo and use its service as their main current account.

Resolver, the independent online complaints resolution service, this week told Guardian Money it had received more than 700 complaints in a little over a year about Monzo, which it describes as a surprising number for a relatively new business. The majority have come in during the past six months. In a third of those cases, its users are specifically saying that their account has been frozen or shut down.

A private Facebook group, Monzo stole our money, has grown to 850 members, mostly customers complaining that their accounts were frozen without warning. The stories on it may alarm some of those thinking of going full Monzo, with reports of accounts shut days before Christmas, and waits of several weeks to get balances returned. Some posters describe having their accounts reprieved and receiving £750 compensation. Others have reported taking the bank to court to get their balances returned.

In October, the BBCs Watchdog programme highlighted the account closure problem, and the impact its policies were having on the banks customers. On the review website Trustpilot it is a similar story, with 13% of reviewers rating Monzo as bad at the time of writing. Posters have described being left at petrol stations unable to pay for fuel or stranded abroad after their account was frozen without warning.

Despite this, Monzo denies that it has changed the way it monitors activity, or that it has a problem with freezing accounts. It claims that when it investigates its frozen accounts, it finds it made the correct decision in 95% of cases.

Monzos 3.2 million customers manage their account using its mobile app. There is a phone line, but those who have their account frozen after the bank finds irregularities are barred from using it.

Resolvers Martyn James suggests that the company appears to be in denial. Its clear that something is going wrong with Monzos current account systems. With people reporting that low-value transactions seem to be resulting in frozen accounts, its clear this cant be anything to do with the laws surrounding money laundering.

Even if a bank decides it doesnt want your business, it has to give you a months notice to make alternative arrangements. Shutting accounts and declining to help has a huge impact on people  particularly if they are getting by on tight budgets or benefits, he says.

Arun Chauhan, a solicitor dealing with financial crime, told Watchdog that Monzos compliance procedures appeared not to have caught up with its growth in customer numbers.

Some customers have separately contacted Guardian Money to describe their bafflement at their treatment after they were the victims of fraud. Customers inability to talk to someone at Monzo when things go wrong has become a particular source of anger.

Mick Lown, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, who is retired and makes guitars, says he was initially delighted with Monzo, particularly its fee-free purchases abroad. He is furious, however, at its response after his eBay account was hacked and £141 taken from his Monzo account to pay for two video games.

He says the bank initially refunded the money, but it was then taken from his account a second time. All his attempts to get the bank to refund the payments, which he is adamant he didnt authorise, failed.

When I challenged it, they sent me proof from a totally unrelated purchase but refused to refund the money, he says. Their automated response system is impossible to deal with if you have a serious complaint. Im now going to have to go to the ombudsman. Im just pleased I kept my main bank account as I no longer trust them.

In December, Money spoke to customer whose Monzo account was taken over by fraudsters, who sent £214 to a Dutch account.

The customer says she was initially told that there was nothing the bank could do, even though the payment was clearly unauthorised and fraudulent. Following Moneys intervention, her money was returned.

A spokeswoman for Monzo says: Its wrong to draw any conclusions about Monzos financial crime practices and customer service by solely using anonymous comments made online. Regulation prohibits all banks from discussing with anyone why an account has been blocked  its a legal offence called tipping off that is designed to protect ongoing law enforcement investigations.

Blocking accounts is a legal requirement, and as a regulated bank we have a duty to detect and prevent financial crime.

The spokeswoman says that, having investigated, the company stood by its decision in relation to Mick Lowns case. Where we get things wrong we put them right and compensate customers, she adds.

James Daley, who runs the Fairer Finance website, says it is no surprise to see cracks possibly starting to appear in the challenger banks offering. Monzo has looked to be the triumph of marketing over substance. While it is relatively easy to build a mobile app, history teaches us that it is very hard for a new bank to build up the kind of systems needed to properly manage millions of accounts.

We have seen it with Metro, and now seemingly with Monzo, he adds. Our most recent research found that relatively few Monzo customers use it as their main current account, and I dont see that changing any time soon.",1
672,"Financial crime as a wider category of cybercrime continues to be one of the most potent of online threats, covering nefarious activities as diverse as fraud, money laundering and funding terrorism. Today, one of the startups that has been building data intelligence solutions to help combat that is announcing a fundraise to continue fueling its growth.

Ripjar, a U.K. company founded by five data scientists who previously worked together in British intelligence at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ, the U.K.âs equivalent of the NSA), has raised $36.8 million (Â£28 million) in a Series B, money that it plans to use to continue expanding the scope of its AI platform â which it calls Labyrinth â and scaling the business.

Labyrinth, as Ripjar describes it, works with both structured and unstructured data, using natural language processing and an API-based platform that lets organizations incorporate any data source they would like to analyse and monitor for activity. It automatically and in real time checks these against other data sources like sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEPs) lists and transaction alerts.

Sources close to the company say that the funding values the startup in the region of Â£100 million, or about $127 million. Ripjar is currently profitable, the company confirmed.

The funding is being led by Long Ridge Equity Partners, a specialist fintech investor, with previous investors Winton Capital Ltd. and Accenture plc also participating. Accenture is a strategic partner: the consultancy/systems integrator uses Ripjarâs tech to work with a number of clients in the financial services sector. Ripjar also has government clients, where its platform is used for counterterrorism work. It declined to disclose any specific names, but it does note that its extensive partner list also includes the likes of PWC, BAE Systems, Dow Jones and more.

âWe are excited to partner with Long Ridge who bring expertise and resources in scaling fast-growing software companies,â said Jeremy Annis, who is both the CEO and CTO of Ripjar and co-founded the company with Tom Griffin, Leigh Jones, Robert Biggs and Jeremy Laycock. âThis investment signals enormous confidence in our world-leading data intelligence technology and ability to protect companies and governments from criminal behaviour which threatens their assets and prosperity. With this funding, we will accelerate the expansion of Ripjar worldwide to provide our customers with the most advanced financial crime solutions, as well as creating new iterations of the Labyrinth platform.â

The startup says that itâs had its biggest year yet â no surprise, given the circumstances. Not only has there been huge shift to online transactions in 2020 because of the rise of the COVID-19 global health pandemic, but a tightening of the world economy has led to more financial scrambling and new nefarious activity, as well as criminal acts to profit from the instability.

Thatâs led to inking deals with six new enterprise customers and expanding deals with four existing major clients, and Ripjar said that it now has some 20,000 clients globally.

And if you are curious about the name, as I was, itâs if anything a meta reference to some of the kind of work that Ripjar does.

âIt doesnât mean anything,â a spokesperson said. âIt was created using technology to ensure a name was selected that had never been used before.â

London, as one of the worldâs financial centers, has developed a strong reputation for hatching and growing interesting fintech startups, and that has also meant the U.K. â which also has a strong talent base in artificial intelligence â has become very fertile ground for startups building services to help protect those fintechs.

Ripjarâs raise, and rise, come within months of two other companies building AI to combat fraud and financial crime also raising money and growing. In July, ComplyAdvantage, which has also been building a database and platform to help combat financial crime, announced a $50 million raise. And a week before that, another U.K. company also building AI for financial and other cybercrime detection, Quantexa, raised $64.7 million.

Ripjar counts both of these, as well as bigger targets like Palantir, among its competitors. As is most likely, the big institutions that are grappling with financial crime are most likely using several companiesâ technology at the same time.

It claims to have the more sophisticated approach. âWe believe that Labyrinth is the most advanced solution in the market as weâve developed it after decades of firsthand experience of fighting crime and terrorism within the national security community,â said David Balson, director of Intelligence at Ripjar, in answer to my question about competitors. âThere is no silver bullet in the fight against crime. As such, weâve had to come up with hundreds of innovations to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the vital work that goes on in the financial sector and law enforcement. This includes our world-leading natural language processing (NLP) and identity resolution capabilities, which work over any global language and script, joining the dots automatically between structured data and unstructured text like documents, news reports, web pages and intelligence reports. Itâs a vital tool to help analysts overcome the information overload that is so often associated with the sector.â

Indeed, the silver bullet reference applies to more than just Ripjarâs technology. With the issue of money laundering alone a $2 trillion problem (with only 1-2% of that ever identified and recovered), you can see why, at least for right now, banks, governments and others might be willing to put multiple resources on the problem to try to tackle it.

âFinancial institutions, corporates and government agencies face ever-increasing risks associated with financial crime and cyber threatsâ said Kevin Bhatt, a managing partner at Long Ridge, in a statement. âWe believe Ripjar is well-positioned to provide artificial intelligence solutions that will allow its clients to reduce the cost of compliance, while uncovering new threats through automation. We are incredibly excited to partner with Ripjar to support their continued growth and look forward to working closely with the Ripjar team as they expand to new geographies, customers, and verticals.â",0

393,"The biggest number of claimants ever tried together in an insurance fraud case have been handed sentences ranging from community service to custody.

Eight men claimed personal injury compensation following a minor collision between a car and bus in Cardiff.

Seven of the group were on the bus in May 2014 when it was hit from behind by a car driven by 30-year-old Merrick Williams (pictured).

Investigators found the impact of the low-speed collision would have been too small to have caused any injuries, but one passenger was seen on CCTV apparently being thrown to the floor, while others held their neck, hip and back.

This guy tried to crash into a bus with 7 mates on board so they could claim compensation. Nice try. #cashforcash https://t.co/LmrdHTwsoJ

 City Police Fraud (@CityPoliceFraud) October 12, 2017

AIG, which insured Williams vehicle, contacted the City of London Polices Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department in August 2014 after receiving personal injury claims from each of the group. Medical reports were submitted from five individuals.

Officers investigating the case found two of the claimants were friends with Williams on social media. It was further discovered the car involved was hired through a car rental company insured by AIG, meaning it had liability for the crash and any subsequent claims.

Williams, of Barry Island, was sentenced yesterday to 12 months in prison for conspiracy to commit fraud and dangerous driving. He was disqualified from driving for two years and fined £200.

Kassim Mukbill, Nigel Thomas Iti, Hamada Shuyeb, Kieran Murphy, Fahmi Haddad, Aaron Ryan and Matthew Saunders, all aged between 24 and 33 and from the Cardiff area, each admitted fraud and were given a suspended prison sentence, 150 hours community service and a £200 fine.

Detective Constable Aman Taylor, who led the investigation, said: This is the largest number of claimants tried together for an Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department case and shows the extent that people will go to for greed and money.

By planning the bus crash, the men deliberately put the safety of innocent people, including children, at risk in a bid to make money and take advantage of the personal injury claims system.",1
557,"Paul Erickson, the longtime Republican operative who had a multiyear romantic relationship with accused Russian agent Maria Butina, was indicted on 11 counts wire fraud and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury in South Dakota, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.

The indictment alleges, according to the Justice Department press release, that between 1996 and 2018 Erickson ""knowingly and unlawfully devised a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money from many victims by means of false and fraudulent pretense, representations, and promises."" The charges are not related to Butinas case or the broader investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The multiyear scheme allegedly involved three entities owned and operated by Erickson  Compass Care, Inc., Investing with Dignity, LLC, and an unnamed venture  through which he allegedly defrauded investors for his personal enrichment. He was arrested and released on bond. If convicted, Erickson faces up to 20 years in federal prison for each count.

A lawyer for Erickson told ABC News the charges are ""wholly unfounded"" and ""will be met by a vigorous defense."" He also noted that these charges are entirely unrelated to matters involving Butina, the 30-year-old Russian gun rights activist who was accused of developing a covert influence operation in the United States

Butina recently agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and cooperate with federal, state and local authorities in any ongoing investigations.

She admitted, as part of the deal, that she and an unnamed ""U.S. Person 1,"" which sources have identified as Erickson, ""agreed and conspired, with a Russian government official (""Russian Official"") and at least one other person, for Butina to act in the United States under the direction of Russian Official without prior notification to the Attorney General.""

Based on the description, the ""Russian Official"" appears to be Alexander Torshin, the former deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Under his direction, the agreement said, she sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics.

It is unclear what Butinas cooperation might entail, but federal prosecutors have reportedly notified Erickson that he is a target of an ongoing investigation. The target letter sent to Erickson is from federal prosecutors in Washington, sources familiar with the case told ABC News, and separate from any South Dakota-based federal fraud investigation into his business dealings.",1
997,"In early September, Cristina Velez lost her job running the staffing team on a Covid-19 treatment trial. Faced with a $2,440 rent bill on the Boca Raton, Fla., home she shares with her daughter, Velez began calling her landlord, Progress Residential, to ask whether it would give her time to come up with the money.

""I told them I was affected by Covid, but it didn't matter to them,"" Velez said. ""They are not very patient.""

On Sept. 8, Progress gave her an ultimatum  pay the rent or deliver the premises, a Palm Beach County court filing shows. Just over two weeks later, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Velez, demanding $4,210.14 in rent and legal fees, delivering the papers to her door.

Not once, Velez said, did Progress representatives tell her about a nationwide eviction moratorium ordered by the federal government to let tenants hurt by Covid-19 stay in their homes if they couldn't pay their rent. The moratorium, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sept. 4, bars landlords from evicting tenants who affirm that they've been harmed by the coronavirus for nonpayment of rent.

""I said, 'There's got to be something for people affected by Covid and being furloughed,'"" Velez, 46, reported telling Progress. ""There's nothing we can do,"" the company representative replied, she said.

Velez said she sold her car to pay Progress.

From early September to Oct. 17, despite the CDC eviction ban, almost 10,000 eviction actions have been filed in 23 counties in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas by large corporate landlords like the one that owns Velez's house, court documents show. After at least one landlord group lobbied the Trump administration, the CDC clarified its ban on Oct. 9, opening the door for still more such actions. New eviction filings have jumped since then, court records show. During the week of Oct. 12, for example, almost 2,000 proceedings were recorded in the five states, almost twice the number from the previous week.

The evictions are part of a database compiled by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that examines the impact of private equity on communities. It began compiling eviction statistics after the pandemic hit, although it isn't known how many evictions are related to the coronavirus.

Large landlords filing numerous evictions include prosperous U.S. public companies like Invitation Homes, which owns and leases 80,000 single-family homes nationwide. The company is thriving  its earnings rose by 54 percent for the first six months of the year, and its stock price has jumped by 80 percent since the market bottomed out in March. Court records show 122 eviction filings by Invitation Homes in the five states during the period.

Velez's eviction action is one of 97 cases filed against tenants by Progress Residential since the CDC announced its ban. Progress, a large and well-funded landlord, owns and leases 40,000 single-family homes nationwide. It is owned by Pretium Partners, a $3 billion hedge fund that invests in distressed properties.

A spokesman for Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Velez in the eviction filing.

In a statement, the spokesman said: ""Progress Residential continually engages with tenants on matters related to their leases. While each matter is unique, we are committed to working with tenants, as appropriate, to try and provide assistance during these extraordinary times.

""Progress Residential complies with applicable law, including the CDC Moratorium, in enforcing rental evictions. Importantly, as part of the CDC Moratorium, tenants are required to provide a declaration that makes clear they are unable to pay rent due to the impact of Covid-19.""

Pretium, the company that owns Progress Residential, is overseen by Donald Mullen, a former Goldman Sachs partner who headed the bank's mortgage and credit operation until he left in 2012. Mullen's work at Goldman emerged in a 2010 Senate investigation into the causes of the mortgage crisis when investigators published a 2007 email he wrote about the ""serious money"" Goldman was poised to make as the mortgage market began to collapse.

Through a spokesman, Mullen declined an interview request about eviction proceedings by Progress Residential and his work at Pretium and Goldman.

Other big landlords filing evictions are owned by private equity firms, such as the Carlyle Group, with 42 actions, the documents show. The top eviction filer, according to the documents, is Ventron Management LLC, a Canadian real estate firm that has brought 281 proceedings.

""The decisions of large companies to advance evictions despite the moratorium quite literally threatens the health of residents and the broader public,"" said Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. He said the five-state figures are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg.

Kristi DesJarlais, senior vice president at Invitation Homes, cast doubt on the eviction figures collected by the nonprofit. ""We question the veracity of the list,"" she said.

In addition, she said eviction wasn't a course the company wants to pursue. ""We have been doing what the CDC order directs since early in the pandemic,"" she said in a statement, ""working with our residents facing Covid-related financial hardships and offering a variety of payment options so they can stay in their homes.""

Ventron didn't respond to an email seeking comment. A Carlyle spokeswoman declined to provide an on-the-record statement.

'An overreach of authority'

When it announced the ban on Sept. 1, the CDC said it was crucial to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Many tenants, out of work because of Covid-19 shutdowns, are struggling to pay their rent; the CDC estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their homes without eviction protections in place.

The CDC action followed the expiration in late August of a narrower eviction moratorium in the CARES Act. Under the CDC ban, tenants are responsible for paying the full amount of rent owed.

The recent rise in evictions may be related to a new CDC notice on Oct. 9 clarifying the terms of the ban, tenant advocates say.

Sept. 1, 202003:04

The new CDC notice specifies that landlords can begin eviction proceedings now, even though they aren't supposed to remove tenants before the end of the year. The new notice also said landlords aren't required to notify tenants about the ban or its terms.

Landlords are also free to challenge tenants' sworn attestations of harm from Covid-19, according to the CDC's clarification, and the agency made it clear that there is no administrative appeal process for tenants faced with such challenges.

The notice from the CDC this month narrowed what had been a broad ban on evictions, tenant groups say, and it gave landlords the upper hand. They warn that a tsunami of homelessness will result, along with lasting financial damage to renters.

It ""puts more power back in the hands of landlords at the expense of low-income renters,"" said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit. ""It creates new burdens for renters and creates new holes in protections for renters.""

A spokesman for the CDC didn't respond to a request for comment about the initial ban and the subsequent changes to it.

Landlord advocacy groups criticized the initial ban and lobbied to change it. One, the National Apartment Association, took credit for the CDC's clarification, describing on its website "" first-hand conversations with the Trump administration and the U.S. Department of Justice"" to battle the ban. The association and other landlord groups are also contesting the legality of the moratorium in court.

""From our perspective, the CDC order was an overreach of their authority, and landlords needed clarification on how to proceed,"" said Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive of the National Apartment Association. ""It's been seven months, and we have members experiencing some financial burdens as a result and carrying a lot of debt.""

'Ethically challenged evictions'

While the CDC ban centers on Covid-19-related harm among renters, it doesn't bar evictions for other reasons, such as those related to health and safety threats by tenants, property damage or criminal activities.

Eviction filings tallied by the nonprofit may well include such cases. But some who work in evictions say landlords at times make faulty claims when pursuing them.

Joe Ferguson is a constable in Pima County, Arizona, and among his tasks is delivering eviction notices to tenants. He works to help combat their removal and explain what their options are.

Many evictions in Pima County are wrongful and violate the CDC moratorium, Ferguson said.

""As we get closer to Dec. 31, there is intense pressure by some landlords to push through ethically challenged evictions,"" Ferguson said. ""Some evictions need to go forward, but in other cases it's people relying on the legal system to go through loopholes.""

As new eviction filings pile up, so do difficulties for tenants. Because evictions can appear on tenants' credit reports, renters may have more difficulty finding new homes, with other landlords likelier to reject their applications. Evictions often push renters into poverty, research shows, with mental and physical health declining along with the likelihood of finding a job.

The recent rise in eviction filings will push many renters to move out even if they qualify to remain in their homes under the CDC ban, tenant advocates say.

""In many states around the country, you can't cure an eviction once it is filed,"" said Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project. ""People are going to get notices and are going to feel they've been evicted and will move out. The CDC order created an incentive for unethical behavior by landlords.""

Pinnegar said the National Apartment Association is encouraging its members ""to operate in a legal and lawful manner."" He said he doesn't expect massive homelessness.

To be sure, the coronavirus has imperiled small, local landlords who have limited cash to sustain their operations. Tenant groups worry that those landlords will be forced to sell their properties to bigger operations, increasing the number of rental units in the hands of institutional landlords.

One consolidation deal was announced Oct. 19, when Pretium Partners, Progress Residential's owners, announced a joint purchase of Front Yard Residential Corp., a public real estate investment trust that owns 14,500 rental homes, with Ares Capital, a private equity firm. Front Yard has filed 97 eviction proceedings in the five states since Sept. 1, the documents show. Pretium and Ares said they will pay $2.4 billion for Front Yard.

After the deal goes through, Pretium will be the nation's second-largest owner and operator of single-family rental homes, it said.

In the meantime, other large and prosperous companies that have ramped up eviction filings include Greystar Real Estate Partners, a private investment firm, which has filed 61 eviction notices, and Eaton Vance, an asset management company, with 48 eviction proceedings. Eaton Vance is being purchased by Morgan Stanley in a $7 billion deal; Morgan Stanley itself, through its AMLI Residential unit, initiated 22 eviction proceedings since Sept. 1.

Eaton Vance, Front Yard and Morgan Stanley all said that they work with tenants in difficulty and that their eviction filings were proper and in accordance with the CDC moratorium. Greystar didn't respond to an email request for comment.

Don Smith has also had problems with Progress Residential, although they aren't Covid-19 related. Smith and his family, who are tenants in Apopka, Florida, had to move out in July. He said his wife has stage four breast cancer and uses a wheelchair; facing huge medical bills, they could no longer afford the rent.

Smith contacted Progress and told it that they were leaving the premises; he said Progress thanked him for letting the company know.

But on Sept. 24, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Smith in court, demanding payment of rent owed and legal fees amounting to $4,218.37.

Smith said he knew nothing about the filing until NBC News contacted him. Now he is concerned that he will have to make the additional payment to clear the eviction from his record.

""They weren't a good landlord. I wouldn't call them good at all,"" Smith said in an interview. ""The sinks were rusting out, and they just painted over it. They'd only fix what they had to.""

Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Smith.

If the CDC moratorium expires without a replacement, a wave of evictions is likely, housing advocates say.

""When you hit Jan. 1, people will owe tens of thousands in back rent,"" said Chris Groninger, chief strategy officer for the Arizona Bar Foundation, a nonprofit that helps low-income people. ""We are creating poverty as we speak.""

By jumping through hoops, Cristina Velez of Boca Raton has managed to pay enough to hang on to her rental home. She has a new job, but she has still had to battle demands from Progress to pay $450 in legal fees associated with her eviction filing.

When Velez challenged the propriety of the eviction after talking with NBC News, the Progress representative told her that the court wouldn't have allowed Progress to make the filing if the eviction wasn't valid. That is false, said Roller of the National Housing Law Project  courts don't verify the accuracy of initial eviction filings.

Velez said the representative declined to detail the process at Progress when she asked about it. According to Velez, he said: ""I don't have to tell you what my process is. We have a company to run.""",0
930,"JYNWEL Capital may not ring a bell, but the name Low Teik Jho, aka Jho Low, sure does. The 32-year-old high-flying businessman needs little introduction, having shot into the limelight for his influence in oil-rich Gulf countries, parties at exclusive clubs with the likes of socialite Paris Hilton and R&B superstar Usher, and his apparent close ties with top Malaysian politicians.

But beyond his flamboyant lifestyle, the Wharton graduate is back in the news  this time for his business dealings.

Consider this  Jynwel Capital  in which Jho Low is the chief executive officer, has in the last three years been involved in deals worth more than US$7bil (RM22bil).

Based on its deal flows, the firm, which is based in Hong Kong, stands taller than many Malaysian-helmed privately-owned entities. And it has caught the attention of Malaysians and foreigners alike.

Jynwel Capital was co-founded by Jho Low and his brother Szen Low in 2010. This was a year after Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), an entity where Jho Low served as an adviser for about five months from January 2009, failed to take off.

TIA was set up to manage the oil royalty money  amounting to more than RM1bil per year  that the state was getting from Petronas. The original plan was for the state to raise RM6bil and the Federal Government to fork out RM5bil to establish a major fund to spur investments in the state and the country.

But TIA did not take off. However the Federal Government went ahead with the RM5bil fund raising that was used to establish 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

Jho Low and his brother Szen Low are the third generation of the Low family from Penang.

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report has estimated the Lows family wealth to be worth US$1.75bil (RM5.76bil).

A spokesperson for Jynwel Capital and the Low family, however, declines to verify the report, citing reasons of confidentiality and security protocols of the enlarged Low family and its beneficiaries.

Nevertheless, if the estimation by WSJ is indeed correct, then this would put the Low familys wealth on par with some of corporate Malaysias richest tycoons like Tan Sri Vincent Tan of the Berjaya Group; Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King of the Rimbunan Hijau Group, and brothers Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin and Datuk Shahriman Shamsuddin of SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, going by Forbes richest-list ranking.

These personalities have a net worth ranging from US$1.4bil to US$1.8bil, according to Forbes magazines 2014 wealth survey for Malaysia.

While Jho Low may appear to be a prime driver in the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities of Jynwel Capital, the firm has participated as a minority investor in these investments except Myla, a spokesperson tells StarBizWeek.

The Low familys investment trusts (advised by Jynwel Capital Ltd) participated as minority investors in these investments, except for Myla where the Low familys investment trusts took a majority stake.

In certain transactions such as Coastal Energy, The Park Lane Hotel and Myla, Jynwel Capital sourced the transaction, acted as an investment adviser and took the lead in managing the transaction process, the spokesperson says via email.

The spokesperson says majority stakeholders in the investments included entities with significant financial resources ranging from the global private equity firm the Blackstone Groups GSO and sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority to high-net-worth billionaire investors such as David Geffen and Dr Thomas Kaplan.

Jynwel Capital has been more visible, given its cooperation with international blue-chip private equity firms, the spokesperson adds.

Prominent deals

On Tuesday, Jynwel Capital, jointly with Spain-based oil and gas (O&G) company Compañía Española de Petróleos, SAU (Cepsa), said it was in discussions to buy London-listed Salamander Energy PLC  a deal, which if successful, will make it a significant O&G player in Asia with production in excess of 50,000 barrels.

Just in the previous week, Jynwel Capital together with unnamed Abu Dhabi-based funds launched a 1.7 billion euros (RM7.06bil) bid to buy Reebok from Adidas AG.

In November last year, Jho Low created a stir in the O&G circle when he teamed up with Cepsa to take over Canadian-listed Coastal Energy Co. Coastal Energy has principal assets in Thailand and Malaysia.

Elsewhere, Jynwel Capital had invested in global commodities company Electrum Group with Kuwait Investment Authority; and was involved in the US$2.2bil acquisition of EMI Music Publishing jointly with The Blackstone Groups GSO, Sony Corp, David Geffen and Mubadala Development Company.

The spokesperson says Jynwel Capital is positioned as an investment adviser to the Low family investment trusts and other consortium investors, besides being involved in investment and advisory services to professional investors. We do not currently manage third-party funds, the spokesperson states.

According to its website, Jynwel Capital has a focus on high-value investments in a variety of target sectors, including media and entertainment, consumer and retail, energy and resources, real estate and hospitality, precious metals, commodities and infrastructure.

Stronger foothold in O&G

Going forward, sources say that Jynwel Capital may be looking to build a stronger foothold in the lucrative O&G sector.

Sources say Coastal Energy has joined in the running to secure a production sharing contract (PSC) for Block PM9, which is a brownfield O&G development located offshore Terengganu.

The PSC for PM9 was supposed to have been awarded by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to the successful bidder by the end of 2013, according to various news reports last year. But little progress has been made so far.

The frontrunner for the project was then reported to be the joint venture comprising Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd and its Canadian partner Talisman Energy Inc.

Sources, however, tell StarBizWeek that the luck may have flipped, with Coastal Energy now seeming to be the favoured one to be awarded the PSC for PM9 by Petronas.

Coastal Energy already has an existing partnership with Petra Energy Bhd for a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang and Meranti cluster fields located offshore Peninsular Malaysia.

When asked on Coastal Energy possibly being awarded the PM9 field, the spokesperson says the Low family investor, Jho Lows father Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng, is purely a minority passive investor in Coastal Energy, and thus, is not in a position to comment. In addition, the spokesperson notes, Larry is not on the board of Coastal Energy.

For the record, a spokesperson for JynWel Capital and the Low family would like to clarify the following:

1) Jho Low's full name Low Taek Jho, and not Low Teik Jho as published.

2) While the articles on Low stated that investments by Abu Dhabi funds in 2007/08 into Iskandar Malaysia and RHB Capital Bhd did not turn out well in subsequent years as the going was slow in Iskandar while RHB Cap shares did not reach the valuations that Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) had paid, the spokesperson said ADCB went through a bid process and sold its shares for a profit. Although it received offers higher than RM10.80 per share, it ultimately sold its shares to Aabar Investments PJS due to certainty and speed of closing.

3) On Iskandar Malaysia, the spokesperson said while it faced challenges in subsequent stages (after the investment in 2007) due to weak global economic conditions, in the last few years the real estate market there had grown tremendously, and the Mudabala consortium was making a good return.

931,"The amount of financial loss from online fraud suffered by people in Western Australia has almost halved, dropping from A$16.8 million in 2014 to A$9.8 million for 2015, according to a statement this January from the states Attorney General and Minister for Commerce, Michael Mischin.

In addition, the minister noted that losses from relationship and dating fraud have fallen by 55%, to A$4.9 million lost last year.

These are both impressive claims, and at face value, there is truth to the statistics. Both assertions are based on data received by WAs Scamnet, which is the public interface between consumer protection and citizens.

While it is good to see a reduction in the number of losses overall, particularly to relationship and dating fraud, it is highly unlikely that the statistics tell the full story.

An under-reported crime

It is well known that fraud has one of the lowest reporting rates of crime types. Reasons include uncertainly in whether a crime has been committed, not knowing who to report to and the shame and embarrassment of being deceived. Generally speaking, reported fraud losses are understood as the tip of the iceberg of actual money lost and harm experienced by victims.

The ministers statement also covered Project Sunbird, a joint initiative between West Australian Police and the West Australian Department of Commerce. Project Sunbird uses financial intelligence to identify and contact people who are sending money to West African countries and notifies them of any suspicions.

The statistics for Project Sunbird show more modest reductions, with the minister reporting that the overall amount of money sent for romance and investment fraud decreased by 26% in 2015. About 72% of people who received a first letter warning of any suspicions stopped sending money immediately, and half of those who received a second letter also stopped sending money.

Again, the statistics are exciting and point to some positive results from Project Sunbird. But there are also caveats to these statistics.

I am a strong supporter of the Project Sunbird approach and have written before on its benefits. But I also believe there are factors that need to be considered in conjunction with these latest reported statistics.

Scammers on the move

Project Sunbird only looks at transactions to a small cluster of five West African countries  Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leonne and Togo. Historically, these have been hot spots for offenders.

Offenders are now asking victims to send money to other countries, including some in Asia, which are not targeted under Project Sunbird, and other similar projects.

The evaluation period for Project Sunbird is three months and only covers the five West African countries. While people may cease sending within these limits, there is currently no ability to expand the project to other countries for a longer period of time.

There has also been a shift in the ways that victims transfer money overseas. Offenders are increasingly using (often unsuspecting) money mules in Australia to move money.

In my latest research interviewing online fraud victims, a large number of victims were asked to send money via a bank transfer to an Australian account. This has changed from earlier work I did where the main focus was on remittance agencies, such as Western Union and Moneygram.

This new approach appealed to victims who were aware of the risks in sending money overseas. There was an increased sense of legitimacy in transferring the money to an Australian bank account.

But once transferred to the Australian account, the money is quickly shifted offshore to offenders. None of this is captured in the Project Sunbird figures.

Changed tactics

Offenders are also changing the methods they use to ask for money. Rather than sending cash through a remittance agency or bank transfer, there is anecdotal evidence from police that some victims have been asked to buy prepaid debit cards and forward these on.

Offenders still receive something of monetary value. However, the use of prepaid currencies avoids current forms of detection.

There are many other factors that could also be considered. For example, the existence of a few high-loss victims can increase or decrease overall dollar values figures significantly.

It is encouraging to see the current downward trend in statistics of the money lost to fraud. Project Sunbird has done a lot in terms of awareness raising and education for the community. It is also an important tool for law enforcement and consumer protection agencies in their bid to reduce victimisation.

Why do people still fall for scams?

There is a great opportunity to further evaluate the impact of Project Sunbird and its influence/crossover with Scamnet results. But I know that whatever the statistics say, there is still the question of why do so many people fall for it?

My response is simple. Its important to remember the highly skilled nature of offenders. Its critical not to underestimate their skills of persuasion and the many social engineering techniques they use to manipulate and exploit individual vulnerabilities.

Everyone has a weakness which, if targeted in the right way at the right time, may make them susceptible. We need to acknowledge that.

The current figures paint a hopeful picture that sees a decrease in the number of victims and the associated amount of losses, though I would argue it is not cause for celebration yet.

Online fraud still poses a significant problem to Australians. It would be a mistake to think that Project Sunbird has solved the issue based on the combination of these statistics.

Rather we must turn our attention to the evolution of these offences and the new ways offenders are targeting potential victims. We must look for new opportunities to ensure that Project Sunbird and other future approaches to combating online fraud are as fluid and flexible as the offenders they seek to target.",0

1025,"Fraud detection with machine learning requires large datasets to train a model, weighted variables, and human review only as a last defense.

With advances in computer technology and ecommerce also comes increased vulnerability to fraud. Hackers are continuously finding new ways to target undeserving victims, from stolen credit card details to false accounts. Any business or individual who uses online payment sources is open to fraud.

In 2015, financial fraud  including payment cards, remote banking and cheques  rose a staggering 26 percent from the previous year, totaling a cost of £755 million. It was the fourth consecutive year that has seen an increase in this area. It is the most common crime in the UK, with 2.47 million offenses reported in 2015-2016 alone. The multi-million pound cost of fraud is proving detrimental to online businesses who foot a high proportion of the bill in chargebacks.

In 2015 all fraud types had risen with much owed to the growth of impersonation and deception scams, as well as sophisticated online attacks such as malware and data breaches.

Why transaction rules arent enough

The traditional approach to tackling this problem is to use rules or logic statements to query transactions and to direct suspicious transactions through to human review. While there is some variation, it is notable that over 90 percent of online fraud detection platforms still use this method, including platforms used by banks and payment gateways. While this is effective to some degree, in cases where there is a sufficient gap between an order being received and goods being shipped, it is also incredibly costly and far slower than alternatives.

The rules in these platform use a combination of data, horizon-scanning and gut-feel. The system is backed with manual reviews to confirm experts decisions. If we take the recent reports of an abundance of Turkish credit cards available on the darknet due to the publicized data breach in Turkey: businesses recognize the increased risk of Turkish cards as fraudulent and can simply add a rule to review any transactions from Turkish credit cards

Following this, every attempted purchase made by such a card raises an alert and is declined or reviewed. However, this raises two significant issues. The first is that such a generalized rule may turn away millions of legitimate customers, ultimately losing the business money and jeopardizing customer relations. Secondly, while this can deter future threats after such fraud has been found, it fails to identify or predict potential threats that businesses are not aware of.

These rules tend to produce binary results, deeming transactions as either good or bad and failing to consider anything in between. And until the rules are manually reviewed, the system will continue to prevent such transactions as those from Turkish credit cards, even if the risk or threat is no longer prominent.

When human review fails

Criminal gangs also use malware and phishing emails as a means to compromise customers security and personal details. Once obtained, fraudsters will use these details to access customer accounts or to commit fraud. These methods all aim to compromise customers personal and financial details, including card data, in order to enable the criminals to commit fraud. Here, the card data used is legitimate but is not being used under the consent of the owner. In these cases, such rules would fail to block transactions.

According to the 2015 Merchant Risk Council (MRC) Global Fraud Survey, merchants typically manually review 10-15 percent of online orders. Other reports suggest that as many as 26 percent of ecommerce orders are manually reviewed. This is prime example of how human endeavor is failing to use and enhance computing efficiency.

Machine learning for fraud detection

Machine learning has been recognized as a successful measure for fraud detection. A great deal of data is transferred during online transaction processes, resulting in a binary result: genuine or fraudulent. Online businesses are able to identify fraudulent transactions accurately because they receive chargebacks on them. However, this happens after the transaction has been processed and therefore is reactive, not proactive.

Machine learning works on the basis of large, historical datasets that have been created using a collection of data across many clients and industries. Even companies that only process a relatively small number of transactions are able to take full advantage of the data sets for their vertical, allowing them to get accurate decisions on each transaction. This aggregation of data provides a highly accurate set of training data, and the access to this information allows businesses to choose the right model to optimize the levels of recall and precision that they provide: out of all the transactions the model predicts to be fraudulent (recall), what proportion of these actually are (precision)?

Once the accuracy of the models is deemed acceptable it is time to start predicting, but where do such predictions come from?

Within the datasets, features are constructed. These are data points such as the age and value of the customer account, as well as the origin of the credit card. There can be hundreds of features and each contributes, to varying extents, towards the fraud probability. Note, the degree in which each feature contributes to the fraud score is not determined by a fraud analyst, but is generated by the artificial intelligence of the machine which is driven by the training set. So, in regards to the Turkish card fraud, if the use of Turkish cards to commit fraud is proven to be high, the fraud weighting of a transaction that uses a Turkish credit card will be equally so. However, if this were to diminish, the contribution level would parallel. Simply put, these models self-learn without explicit programming such as with manual review.

Such features in machine learning-based systems make it possible for fraud analysts to identify the most significant contributors. Feedback from users to confirm the systems decisions by marking customers as genuine or fraudster improves the machines learning ability, adding to accuracy.

Three steps to predict fraud using machine learning

Extract features from a dataset.
Provide training set.
Build models.

In questioning the practicality of building the models, note that models can be reused from similar data. Example: A model used for one retail ecommerce site will also work for another, albeit with minor adjustments of features, thus meaning the implementation of such a model is relatively quick.

Merchants who use such systems are continuously assessing customers for fraud, recalculating a score with every action that occurs on their website or app. If an action is deemed to breach the fraud probability threshold, the transaction will be blocked.

In order to lessen, and hopefully defeat, the onslaught of fraud, businesses must improve the accuracy and speed of their decisions on fraudulent threats. The only mature technology available to achieve this is machine learning. Manual review is most effective as the last defense against fraud: While it can be invaluable, particularly in cases where there is no substitute for human insight, manual review works best to help fine-tune machine learning models decisions and aid their detection of changing patterns of fraud, rather than being the sole fraud detection process. Information from detected fraud threats needs to be used to enhance the next generation of automated fraud prevention, rather than replace it.",0

396,"Rajiv Gandhis Bofors Scandal

Uncategorized | No Comments

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi brought the issue of Bofors under the light again. PM slammed Congress in a rally while campaigning in Chaibasa, Jharkhand, for calling him a thief. He accused Rahul Gandhis father of being the actual thief for scamming Indians in the name of Bofors.

Since the last 30 years our politicians, our media and we have been mentioning the name Bofors. The first time when the name came under light, the prime minister of India was Rajiv Gandhi. He or his close dignitaries were accused of taking a bribe of 64 crore Rupees from a Swedish arms company Bofors, for giving it a contract for more than 400 Howitzer guns.

The severity of this scandal was such that it caused Rajiv Gandhi to lose the elections and gave a boost to VP Singhs campaign leading to his win.

How it all started?

In 1984, India elected Rajiv Gandhi as its 9th Prime Minister. He won 404 seats out of 514 Lok Sabha seats while the now ruling party, the BJP, could only manage 2 seats. He succeeded his mother Indira Gandhi who had died by then. Such a big majority was never attained by any other PM of India. His main political agenda while campaigning was to bring computer revolution and end corruption. Being one of the best orators India had ever seen, he had a great influence and was given the name Mr. CLEAN by the general public, but this image couldnt last much longer.

V P Singh coming into the picture

Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was a close ally of Sanjay Gandhi. When Rajiv Gandhi came into power, he appointed V P Singh as the Finance Minister. As Finance Minister V P Singh started a campaign for catching big companies who were committing tax evasions and frauds. Such actions made V P Singh quite popular amongst the general public, who started portraying him as a loyal, honest politician. During his tenure as Finance Minister, the customs revenue went up by 20% and excise revenue went up by 12%.

Things were working well until now but suddenly Rajiv Gandhi decided to transfer V P Singh to the defense ministry. All this happened as V P Singh was preparing the 1987 budget. This is where things started to get a bit hot for Rajiv Gandhi. There were various speculations that either this step was taken as V P Singhs popularity was a threat to Rajiv Gandhi or Rajiv Gandhi had succumbed to pressure from big industrialists who were against V P Singhs strict policies. Although Rajiv Gandhi attributed all this to growing tensions between India and Pakistan, the real reason remains unknown.

Mr. Bhure Lal, Director of the Enforcement Directorate, on 6th Feb 1987 sent a note to Revenue Secretary Mr. Vinod Pandey. The note had information about Bhure Lal giving work to Fairfax; an American detective agency. The work was regarding tax fraud and tax evasion committed by big companies. The Indian government had a policy stating that whosoever provides information regarding tax evasions and frauds shall be compensated with an amount which will be some percentage of the amount for which the fraud was committed. Fairfax was to be compensated as per this policy.

After a few days of sending the note, Bhure Lal was removed from the position of Director of the Enforcement directorate. This baffled V P Singh, who was Defence Minister by then. He sent a note to his old ministry stating that Bhure Lal had done everything as per his orders. He also accepted that he had kept Rajiv Gandhi in the dark over the issue as he didnt consider it necessary. All these talks in the ministries leaked and got public. The partys senior leadership was led to believe that Fairfax was given contract as an attempt to overthrow the government and all this was endangering Indias freedom. V P Singh was at the center of this controversy. He was being targeted by his own party let alone the opposition. But V P Singh had found a way to silence these attacks.

The HDW Submarine deal

HDW (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft) is a German shipbuilding company. The first time the company was dealt with was when Indira Gandhi was PM. Now the Rajiv Gandhi government gave it a contract for submarines. Though the deal was done before V P Singh, it came to him in the final phases. V P Singh thought that the submarine was a bit overpriced. He contacted the company to bargain on the price.

V P Singh got a telex from the Indian ambassador in Western Germany. It stated that an Indian agent had demanded 7% commission out of the deal. This agent had already been paid, hence, the price could not be reduced. This surprised V P Singh as the government had a policy of no middlemen in any defense deal. V P Singh shared this information with Rajiv Gandhi.

V P Singhs resignation from the defense ministry

There was a very evident tension amongst the two Ministers. Each of them thought that the other was conspiring against him. On 6th April 1987, Rajiv Gandhi set up a commission comprising of two supreme court judges to investigate the Fairfax deal. The commission called upon V P Singh to answer for various Whys, Ifs & Buts of Fairfax deal.

V P Singh had seen the writing on the wall and was ready to counter the situation. On 9th April V P Singh called a press conference at his residence and without discussing with cabinet, gave orders to investigate the HDW submarine deal. On 10th April Rajiv Gandhi summoned V P Singh to answer as to why he had made that decision unilaterally.

V P Singh had made up his mind to resign. He realized that the differences between him & Rajiv Gandhi were insurmountable. Hence, on 12th April V P Singh gave his resignation from the post of defense minister.

Bofors scandal coming into the light

Just 4 days after the resignation of V P Singh, the news broadcasted on Swedish radio relating to Bofors. The broadcast claimed that Bofors had bribed several Indian politicians to get 155mm howitzers deal. This claim had knocked Rajiv Gandhis claim to cleanse the corrupt elements.

The Fairfax and HDW matter was still running in the papers and Bofors came in. It was the budget session of parliament when the Bofors news came in. A lot of hue and cry was made in the parliament. On 20th April, Rajiv Gandhi addressed the parliament. He claimed that there were no middlemen involved in the Bofors deal. He also said that no such commission was given to him or any of his family members. This was the giveaway, as until now nobody had accused him or his family members of anything. It was just that the Indians were involved and nobody knew who they were.

Indian origin journalist Chitra Subramaniam and Editor of The Hindu Mr. N. Ram investigated the scandal. If their investigation is to be believed, a bribe of around 64 crore rupees was taken to finalize the deal.

Involvement of Rajiv Gandhi

When the Bofors deal was done, Rajiv Gandhi was the acting defense minister. The competition to get the howitzer deal was between two companies. One was Swedish company Bofors and the other was a French company named Sophma. Both the companies were in talks from December 1985 to 23rd march 1986. And then within 24 hours, Rajiv Gandhi signed the deal in favor of Bofors.

The then Indian ambassador for Sweden, B.N.Ojha wrote a book on this. He says that Rajiv Gandhi came to Sweden to attend the funeral of Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme. On 15 March 1986, Rajiv Gandhi met the new Swedish Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson and gave his condolences. He also talked about the howitzer deal and assured him that the deal would be done with Bofors. Within eight days of this meet, Bofors got the howitzer deal.

From a Deal to a Scandal

A year later the Bofors deal was again in the news but this time as a scandal. The Indian government thought to persuade the Swedish Government to falsify the claims. With this request, B.N.Ojha wrote to his counterpart in the Swedish government, Karl Johan Oberg. He replied saying that the accused was a private Swedish company, hence, any falsification on the part of the Swedish government wont be right. He also stated that the first step should be an investigation rather than any falsification.

The Indian Government as a measure asked the Swedish to carry out an investigation. But a few days later the Swedish Government denied any investigation being carried out. To this B.N.Ojha again wrote to Karl Johan Oberg asking him as to why they were denying any investigation. Karl replied that on 27th April, Rajiv Gandhi had spoken to Swedish PM. He had asked to stop any investigation as Bofors had made it clear that no middlemen were involved in the deal.

V.P. Singh Expelled

Up till now apart from V.P. Singh likes of Arun Nehru, Arif M. Khan, and V C Shukla were all unsatisfied and in opposition of Rajiv Gandhi. On 15th July 1987, the three union ministers among other ministers had a meeting in Haridwar. Later that evening expulsion of these three ministers was ordered. In an interview when asked the reason for his expulsion, former Union Minister Arif M. Khan replied that there increasing popularity was perceived as a threat by Rajiv Gandhi.

To demonstrate his view on the expulsion of these leaders, V.P. Singh resigned from Rajya Sabha. To this, Rajiv Gandhi replied by expelling V.P. Singh from Congress party. To think that the people expelled by Rajiv Gandhi in the span of a few days were the ones running the whole ministry just a few days back.

Who were the middlemen?

After the resignation of Arun Singh, the then union minister of state for the defense on 18th July 1987, the opposition in Congress party went a notch up. Rajiv Gandhi had to succumb to the pressure in the country. Hence a 30 member Joint Parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the deal. The committee didnt have any member from the opposition parties. As one can perceive, the committee gave the government a clean chit.

But before the JPC could write a report, a report was published in The Hindu on 23rd April 1988. The report was written by Chitra Subramaniam and N. Ram. It claimed that Bofors had credited money in a Swiss bank account named PITCO. The account belonged to British businessman J.P. Hinduja. The government though rejected all these claims saying that the account had no links with the Bofors deal money.

Diary of Martin Ardbo

A few more names came into light when Chitra Subramaniam found a diary linking them to Bofors deal. The diary was of Martin Ardbo, the then president of Bofors. It had information regarding the deal but in coded language. The names involved in the deal were not specified but were demonstrated in codes. The diary mentioned that Qs involvement in the deal could be a problem because of his closeness with R. Q and R were presumably Quattrocchi and Rajiv Gandhi. The diary also mentioned the name of three companies of arms agents involved in the deal. These companies were PITCO, SWENSKA & AE SERVICES. Of these PITCO was J.P. Hindujas company and SWENSKA was of Win Chadha. AE SERVICES though couldnt be linked to anyone at that time.

An investigation of all the Bofors accounts was done by the Indian government. It turned out that one of the accounts was linked to Ottavio Quattrocchi in a swiss bank. Hence, it seemed clear that Quattrocchi got some of the Bofors money

Who was Ottavio Quattrocchi?

Quattrocchi was an Italian businessman who had close ties with the Gandhi family. His proximity to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi through his Italian wife Sonia Gandhi is thought to have contributed to the defeat of the Congress party in the 1989 elections. Quattrocchi, born in Mascali, Province of Catania, Sicily, in 1938. He arrived in India in the mid-1960s as the representative of Italian oil and gas firm ENI and its engineering arm Snamprogetti. His family became close to the Gandhi family based on their connection with Sonia Gandhi.

Quattrocchis influence extended to ministers was noted by V.P.Singh, whose testimony is summarised in a court judgment 

 V.P. Singh, Finance Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi Cabinet, has stated that Quattrocchi had sought an appointment with him on a number of occasions but he did not give him any appointment. Rajiv Gandhi then asked him to meet Mr. Quattrocchi  The link between the public servants, politicians, and Quattrocchi looms large in these deals. The award of Jagdishpur Fertilizer Plant to Quattrocchi, changing the earlier decision for SPIC, is a clear case. 

He won about 60 projects for Snamprogetti. In the process, it also became known that for contracts with India, Quattrocchi was the man to approach.

Rise of V.P. Singh

A proper investigation was being demanded from the government. The Swedish were also obliged to carry out any investigation from there side. But it didnt happen and if it did, it was just for the sake of silencing the uproar in public.

V.P Singh was very benefitted with all this nuisance happening in the government. After leaving Congress he became popular among the general public and was recognized as the face of new anti-corrupt India.

As all this was happening, a Lok Sabha seat in Allahabad got vacant. This seat was left vacant by Amitabh Bachan, who was also being pulled into the Bofors controversy but was given a clean chit later. V.P. Singh stood from this seat as an independent candidate and was later supported by the entire opposition apart from Congress and BSP. In his opposition was Sunil Shastri, the son of late Lal Bahadur Shastri. V.P. Singh won this election by a big margin.

Formation of Janta Morcha

V.P.Singh, V.C.Shukla, Arun Nehru, Arun Singh, Devi Lal, and some others came together to form Janta Morcha. The election season was on the verge and the campaigning had started. V.P. Singh took the Bofors deal from Parliament to the people. V.P. Singh while campaigning, claimed that Rajiv Gandhi too had got the money from the Bofors deal via a bank account named LOTUS and was adamant to prosecute all those who had defrauded the government.

Finally, the election of 1989 brought loss to Congress. The party which had bagged more than 400 seats in 1984 could only manage 195 seats in 1989. On the other hand, V.P.Singhs Rashtriya Morcha bagged 146 seats. Congress still being the largest party was requested upon by the President to form the government, which Rajiv Gandhi rejected, hence, the Janta Morcha, supported by BJP and other opposition parties formed the government under the leadership of V.P.Singh.

V.P.Singh, as promised, went after Bofors and gave CBI the orders to investigate the deal. His party although couldnt last to see the outcomes of the investigation as after 11 months of being in power the party lost majority.

What happened to the accused?

The main breakthrough in the Bofors case happened in 1993 in a Swedish Supreme Court. It was found that Ottavio Quattrocchi and his wife Maria Quattrocchi were the actual owners of AE SERVICES. During this time Quattrocchi was in India itself, but as soon as he found out that the court had ruled against him, he fled.

A lookout notice was released against him. After this, he was found in three different places but due to lack of conviction and effort from CBI and authorities, the Indian government was unable to bring him back.

A charge sheet was filed by CBI on 22 October 1999. This charge sheet was filed against Win Chadha, Ottavio Quattrocchi, Bofors company and its president Martin Ardbo. The charge sheet had charged Rajeev Gandhi too, but since he had died in 1991, no trial was carried out on him. In the year 2000, a supplementary charge sheet was filed in which Shreechand Hinduja, Gopichand Hinduja, and Prakashchand Hinduja were also charged.

In 2002, Win Chadha died and in 2005 the case against the Hinduja brothers was also dismissed. On 6 February 2007, Quattrocchi was detained in Argentina based on the Interpol warrant. The Indian investigating agency CBI came under attack for putting up a half-hearted effort towards his extradition. India lost the case for his extradition in June 2007. The judge remarked that India did not even present proper legal documents. Consequently, India was asked to pay Quattrocchis legal expenses.

The CBI appealed to Delhi High Court in 2011 to dismiss the Bofors case, which was accepted. Quattrocchi died in 2013 of a heart attack.

To Conclude

Despite the controversy, the Bofors gun was used extensively as the primary field artillery. During the Kargil war with Pakistan, it gave India an edge according to battlefield commanders.

The Bofors scandal was a turning point in Indian politics. It was the first major corruption scandal that caught the highest echelons of power in its net. There is nothing that suggests that payments had been received by Rajiv Gandhi. He was, however, guilty of knowing about the kickbacks and not taking action on them.

Though Rajiv Gandhis 5-year tenure is mostly remembered for its big controversies to name a few: Bofors, Unlocking the Babri, Shah Bano ordinance & Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil war, there were several positive steps he took-

Liberalization of economy and easing of restrictions.
He fought Left and the Right to open India to computer imports thus bringing an IT revolution.
He brought telephones from classes to masses by creating Public Calling Offices(PCO).
Lowered voting age from 21 to 18, empowering youth.
Rajiv Gandhi introduced local body elections and formalized Panchayats.
He brought peace to Punjab which had been in turmoil for 10 years by signing Punjab Acord with Akali leaders.
He strengthened India-China relations.

556,"SYDNEY  The Australian government on Thursday accused the country's biggest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, of widespread breaches of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.

Financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC said it had initiated civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against CommBank for ""serious and systemic non-compliance,"" in the biggest case of its kind in Australia and the first against a major bank.

""The effect of CommBank's conduct in this matter has exposed the Australian community to serious and ongoing financial crime,"" AUSTRAC said in a court filing.

Commonwealth Bank said in a statement it was reviewing the allegations and would respond ""in due course.""

Australia's biggest mortgage lender failed to report suspicious matters ""either on time or at all involving transactions totalling over AUS $77 million ($61 million),"" AUSTRAC said.

The agency alleged 53,700 contraventions of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act, particularly with regards to so-called intelligent deposit machines or IDMs.

The previous biggest such case came against Australia's top bookmaker Tabcorp Holdings, earlier this year, with only 108 alleged breaches. Tabcorp paid A$45 million in fines, the biggest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.

An AUSTRAC spokeswoman declined to comment on possible penalties facing CommBank, or whether other banks could be in the agency's firing line.

The maximum penalty for contravening the anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing law is AUS $18 million per breach.

Anonymous Deposits

IDMs are a type of automated teller machine that accepts deposits by both cash and check, and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.

There had been significant growth in the use of CommBank's IDMs since their rollout in May 2012, AUSTRAC said. Cash deposits in the six months to June 2016 surged to AUS $5.8 billion compared with AUS $89 million in the first six months after CommBank introduced the machines.

Cash was deposited using fake names with proceeds going to drug importation syndicates, AUSTRAC alleges in its court filings.

""Even after suspected money laundering or structuring on Commbank accounts had been brought to CommBank's attention, CommBank did not monitor its customers with a view to mitigating and managing money laundering/terrorism financing risk,"" the court filing shows.

CommBank accounts were also used for ""cuckoo smurfing,"" a form of money laundering THAT involves transfers between countries without the need for money to actually cross international borders, AUSTRAC added.",1
545,"Lamine Diack, the disgraced former IAAF president, has been ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering. It follows a four-year investigation in France into doping cover-ups, extortion and bribe-taking in world athletics.

The 86-year-old, who led the International Association of Athletics Federations from 1999-2015 and was one of the most influential men in global sport, is accused of being part of a conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for money. This conspiracy also involved the Russian athletics chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, Russias former national middle distance coach Alexei Melnikov, Diacks former aide Habib Cissé and the IAAFs former head of anti-doping, Gabriel Dollé. These four will also face trial on the same charges, along with Diacks son, Papa Massata Diack, the disgraced former IAAF marketing executive who was banned for life from athletics in 2016. They all deny the charges.

All six will be tried for their role in the case of Liliya Shobukhova, the London Marathon winner in 2010, who paid $600,000 in exchange for covering up violations in her athlete biological passport thus allowing her to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games.

According to the prosecutors, Diack and his son, who oversees a sports consulting business called Black Tidings, solicited payments from athletes, either directly or indirectly, totalling 3.45m in exchange for covering up positive doping tests and allowing athletes to go on competing.

Massata Diack has also emerged as a central figure in French judicial probes of suspected corruption involving the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games and other sports events. The judicial official says the younger Diack will stand trial for complicity in corruption and money laundering. Believed to be living in Senegal, he could be tried in absentia.

The French authorities have also been investigating allegations Diack Sr received bribes for his votes in several bidding contests for high-profile sports events. The former International Olympic Committee member is claimed to have controlled the votes of several African colleagues.

It is alleged that Diack Sr, a former mayor of Senegals capital Dakar, used these payments to fund political campaigns in his homeland, as well as a lavish lifestyle in Monaco, where the IAAF is based.",1
600,"The warrant, as described by the G1 news site, accuses Maggi, 61, of crimes of obstruction of an investigation into a criminal organization in his home state.

Brazil's Police raided the home of a top government official Thursday seeking evidence in yet another corruption case involving a member of embattled President Michel Temer's Cabinet. The operation was authorized by Brazil's top court and is part of an investigation of Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi, who is suspected of bribing state lawmakers during his 2003-2010 terms as governor of Mato Grosso.

Police also raided offices of eight state lawmakers and the mayor of the state capital, Cuiaba, in connection with the case. The investigation began after a plea bargain was struck with Maggi's successor as governor, Silval Barbosa.

A police statement did not say whether Maggi was present during the raid at his apartment in the national capital, Brasilia. Maggi denied any wrongdoing in his political or business dealings.

The warrant, as described by the G1 news site, accuses Maggi, 61, of crimes of obstruction of an investigation into a criminal organization in his home state.

There was never a move by me or authorized by me to act illegally in my administration's decisions or to obstruct justice, he said in a statement.

But in the decision to green-light the raids, Supreme Court Justice Luiz Fux said there was clear evidence that Maggi also tried to obstruct justice by paying bribes to a former state government secretary.

Maggi is one of Brazil's wealthiest agro-business leaders, known as the king of soybeans. He was elected senator in 2011 and named by Temer to his Cabinet post in May 2016. He has angered environmental protection groups, which accuse him of destroying Amazon forests.

Maggi is one of several Temer officials under investigation, and some have resigned in the last year over corruption allegations. The president himself was accused of corruption by the country's top prosecutor but won a vote in Congress to avoid being suspended from office pending a trial.",1
272,"(CNN) Maurice Fayne, who stars in VH1's ""Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,"" has been arrested and charged with federal bank fraud after misusing funds from a Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loan, federal officials said Wednesday.

Fayne, also known as ""Arkansas Mo,"" runs a corporation called Flame Trucking, and he submitted a PPP loan application for the company on April 15, stating that the business had 107 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1,490,200, according to an affidavit for the criminal complaint.

Flame Trucking asked for a loan of $3,725,500 and certified that the loan proceeds would be used to ""retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments, as specified under the Paycheck Protection Program Rule,"" the affidavit alleges.

United Community Bank ultimately funded the loan for $2,045,800 in late April, according to the affidavit.

Fayne then used more that $1.5 million of the funds to buy $85,000 in jewelry, including a Rolex watch, a diamond bracelet, and a 5.73 carat diamond ring for himself, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia said in a release.

Fayne also leased a 2019 Rolls-Royce Wraith, and paid $40,000 for child support, according to the statement.

""At a time when small businesses are struggling for survival, we cannot tolerate anyone driven by personal greed, who misdirects federal emergency assistance earmarked for keeping businesses afloat,"" said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, in the statement.

An attorney for Fayne pointed to the ""considerable confusion"" about PPP guidelines when asked by CNN about the charges against her client.

""There has been considerable confusion among small business owners about PPP guidelines -- particularly around the question of whether and how business owners are permitted to pay themselves a salary or take an owner's draw. I hope these issues to be better fleshed out in the weeks and months to come,"" attorney Tanya Miller said in a statement.

""For obvious reasons, we cannot try these allegations in the media,"" Miller said. ""We will provide the appropriate response in the proper forum once all the information has been provided to us.""

The PPP loan program from the federal government aims to help small businesses and their workers survive during the Covid-19 pandemic. The loans are for businesses with 500 or fewer employees to pay workers' salaries, rent and utility costs.

In an interview with federal agents last week, Fayne said he used the PPP loan to ""pay payroll and other business expenses"" of the company, and ""Fayne expressly denied that he used any of the PPP loan proceeds to pay his personal debts,"" according to the court document.

Federal agents searched Fayne's residence in Dacula, Georgia, May 11, where they also discovered about $80,000 in cash, including $9,400 that Fayne had in his pockets, court documents say.

Fayne told the agents that he had used the PPP loan to buy the jewelry, and when asked if he had used any of the loan on the Rolls- Royce, he said, ""Kinda, sorta, not really,"" according to the affidavit.

""Fayne told the agents that he believed he had the right to use part of the PPP loan proceeds for 'other business purposes' and for 'working capital,'"" the court document said.

Fayne was released on a $10,000 bond Wednesday.",1
497,"What is Vijay Mallyas Scam? Vijay Mallya Case Study

Have you heard about Kingfisher? Yes, you may have heard the name of the kingfisher because it is the most prominent brand in beer.

Kingfisher Owns by United Spirits. Vijay Mallya is the chairman of United Spirits.

Mallya owes a Rs 9,000 crore from 17 Indian banks and is accused of fraud and money laundering cases in the country.

In this blog, we will discuss what is the Vijay Mallyas scam. We will also read the failure reason of Kingfisher airline which is owned by Vijay Mallya. So lets start the Vijay Mallya Case Study

Whats in it for me

1. Kingfisher Company Overview

Kingfisher is an Indian brand owned by United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) or UB Group Bangalore based Indian Company. UB group has several businesses but its core business is beer, aviation, and investment.

UB Group markets its beer product under the brand name of kingfisher, UB groups also owns several brands of beers. Kingfisher was launched in 1978 and now it is the largest beer producer of India with market shares.

Kingfisher beer is also sold in many other countries. UB group also launched Kingfisher airlines in India. Till December 2011 Kingfisher Airlines had the second largest market share in Indias domestic air travel. The company closed its operations in India after its inspections.

2. Who is Vijay Mallya?

Vijay Mallya is an Indian businessman and former member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). Vijay Mallya also owns Royal Challenger Banglore  IPL Team. Vijay Mallya became the chairman of United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) in 1983 at the age of 28 after his fathers death. Vijay Mallya grew its company rapidly.

From 1998 to 1999, Vijay Mallya grew the turnover of the company by 64%. He also Diversified the business of the company by acquiring many other companies. He acquired Berger Paints which is an Indian Paint company.

Vijay Mallya was also elected as a member of parliament twice from Karnataka. The company also achieved the milestone of selling 10 crores cases in India and by this achievement, the company became the second-largest spirits company in India.

All this achievement was possible by the control of Vijay Mallyas Chairmanship. Kingfisher Airlines was launched by Vijay Mallya in 2015.

3. What is Vijay Mallyas Scam

Vijay Mallya wants to expand his liquor and Airline business. His advisors advise him not to do this but despite his advisors advice, he does the same. He sold another company formed by his father to fund its airline company.

Vijay Mallyas kingfisher becomes Indias no.1 domestic airline company and first choice of every passenger. Due to some restrictions, the Indian Government did not allow kingfishers to fly international flights. To fly international flights he leveraged United Spirits or United Breweries to buy Deccan Air which is a loss-making company and merged it with Kingfisher Airlines but it could not make the profits thus in 2010 Malayas this business was in heavy loss.

To run this business he continuously took loans from banks. He took loans of 9000 crores by 17 banks. Although SBI has declared them as bankrupt other banks kept lending him loans because he was a member of Rajya Sabha and some parties supported him. His company kingfisher also -held service tax of passengers, PF, Income Tax of Employees, but did not submit to the PF or IT authorities.

The company also did not pay the salary of its employees or ran out of cash. In 2012 the company had to shut down its operation. Vijay Mallya had a loan of 9000 from different banks and he denied to pay this loan.

The Company United Breweries forced Vijay Mallya to resign the post of chairman of united spirits and paid him $75M for a severance payment, but Indian courts blocked this payment.

SBI and other banks filed a case against Vijay Mallya but before taking any action against Vijay Mallya he flew away to the United Kingdom. There is also a side story of Vijay Mallya that he offers banks to pay 4000 crores for settlement but banks refused their proposal. Banks demand at least 4900 crores which a principal amount furthermore banks are demanding interest as well.

4. Loans Taken by Vijay Mallya

Rs 800 crore PNB
Rs 800 crore IDBI

Rs 410 crore Central Bank of India
Rs 320 crore UCO Bank

5. Failure Reason of Kingfisher Airlines

1. Lack of Business Strategy

The first reason for the failure of Kingfisher airlines is the lack of strategy. First, the company launched an economic class service later they shifted to luxury class After that they shifted as a low-cost airline.

As the company continuously changes its targeted audience, passengers lose interest in this airline. The other issue in their business strategy is that they do not focus on Profitable routes.

2. Lack of Management

The other failure of Kingfisher airlines is that Vijay Mallya involved too much in his airline business. Kingfisher doesnt have any long term CEO or MD. Management is an important part of any business whether its failure or success.

3. 2008 Recession

There are not all internal faults in the failure of Kingfisher airlines; there are some external factors too. The other reason for failure in Kingfisher airlines is the 2008 recession which plays an important role in the failure of Kingfisher airlines.

The recession impacted the whole world and also the aviation industry. Due to the recession, there is high inflation in fuel prices or airport charges. All of these factors impact the health of Kingfisher airlines.

As we have already discussed the acquisition of Air Deccan which is a low-cost airline company that was acquired by Kingfisher airline. In the Begging, Vijay Mallya treated both as separate companies.

There was a time when the flight of both companies flew at the same time but later they decided to cancel the flights of Air Deccan but the customers of Air Deccan did not transfer to Kingfisher Airline They transferred to their competitor.

5. High Operational cost

The other external reason for the failure of kingfisher airline is that there is a high operational cost in the airline industry as compared to other industries. Airline companies require licenses for came the next thing that is a merger with Air Deccan, which the routes, investment in the aircraft maintenance, salaries were a low-cost airline.

There is also a high price of fuel and the company did not able to recover its cost or continuously made loose. There is also great competition in the airline industry thats why this company offers low cost but they forget if they did not earn a good margin their company will be closed.

I hope you learn very important lessons from Vijay Mallya Case Study. Share this case study with your friends.

6. RCBs Connection With Vijay Mallya
RCB is an IPL franchises team that was founded by United Spirits in 2008. Royal Challenger Bangalore also promotes its brand Kingfisher till 2013 but in 2014 no liquor brand was promoted by RCB.

United Sprites Wholly owns the RCb thus Vijay Mallya Resigned from United Spritss chairman he also resigned from RCs Director Position. After Vijay Mallya Financial scandals Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers and RCB changed the team logo. RCBs holding company Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL) is owned by United Spirits.

United Spirits now owned by the British beverage company Diageo, is the largest shareholder in RCSPL. Diageo Acquired United Sprits in 2014. Before Acquiring United Spirits Diageo has conducted an investigation in which they found financial irregularities of t Rs 1.15 billion (Rs 115 crore). USLs management revealed that Rs 1.15 billion had been potentially diverted from RCSPL. In 2019, the company earns more than 10% of its operating profits Through RCB While RCB performed Very Bad in the season.

Aguila Saleh Issa was born on January 11, 1944, in the town of Al Qubbah, Libya.

Following the 2014 Libyan Parliamentary election, Aguila Saleh Issa was elected as parliament speaker, but was forced to flee to Tobruk along with the rest of the Libyan House of Representatives after Tripoli was seized by militias. [5]

On February 20, 2015, Aguila Saleh Issa's residence was the target of bombing by ISIL militants in the town of Al Qubbah. In what became known as Al Qubbah bombings, bombs also targeted a petrol station and a police station. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Libya since the end of the 2011 civil war, resulting in a total of at least 40 people killed, although it was not clear how many died in the attack on his residence. ISIL said that the attacks were carried out in retaliation for the 2015 Egyptian military intervention in Libya. [6]",0
1014,"Today, members of the European Parliament adopted new rules to help fight money laundering and terrorist financing in the EU, one of the key actions in the European Security Agenda presented last month (see IP/15/4865).

V?ra Jourová, the EU's Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, welcomed the vote in Parliament which marked the final adoption of the anti-money laundering package: Serious and organised crime is driven by profit - tracing the illicit proceeds of crime back to the criminal networks is essential both to detect, prosecute and dismantle those networks and to seize and confiscate their criminal wealth. The new anti-money laundering rules adopted today will help us follow the money and crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing.""

The new strengthened European anti-money laundering framework will contribute to the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering by:

facilitating the work of Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money and facilitate the exchange of information;
establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes;
ensuring full traceability of funds transfers within, to and from the European Union.

The Commission will supplement this legislation by working on a supranational assessment of risks. Both texts fully take into account the 2012 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) (see MEMO/12/246), the international standard-setter in the field, and go further on a number of issues to promote the highest standards for anti-money laundering and to counter terrorism financing.

Work must now begin to ensure this framework, which focuses on greater effectiveness and improved transparency, is quickly and effectively put in place. The Commission will work with Member States to speed up the process of implementation of the new Anti-Money Laundering requirements.

On 5 February 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (IP/13/87) which consists of two legal instruments:

A Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing;
A Regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds to secure ""due traceability"" of these transfers.

The package received the agreement of Ministers in the Council in June 2014 (STATEMENT/14/197). In December 2014, the Parliament and Council reached political agreement on the rules (see news), which was formally endorsed by the Council in February 2015 (see STATEMENT). The Parliament and the Council have adopted the final text.

Following the recent terrorist attacks in Copenhagen, Paris and Brussels, the Council and the Commission agreed to take decisive action against terrorist financing. To enhance the efficiency of the new anti-money laundering rules, the two institutions call for further efforts towards speeding up national implementation of those rules, strengthening cooperation on terrorist financing between the Member States' Financial Intelligence Units, and addressing terrorist financing risks via the EU supranational risk assessment. It is also of utmost importance that coordinated action at international, European and national level to tackle terrorist financing is as effective as possible. The Commission will be examining further actions on countering terrorist financing in the context of implementing the recently adopted European Security Agenda.

The publication of the package in the Official Journal of the EU is due for around June-July 2015. A process to guide Member States in implementing the Directive into national law will be put in place over the coming months (the implementation period is two years).

How do countries ensure that remittance service providers  who are often serving the worlds poorest people  mitigate their risk for abuse by money launderers and terrorist organizations?
This important question is addressed by new Guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
The United Nations estimates that developing countries received over US$400 billion in remittances from migrants living abroad in 2014. These funds are often the first financial service that migrants and their families use, so it is important that people can send and receive funds with relative ease and at reasonable cost. However, remittance service providers and the governments that supervise them, must ensure that they are not abused by parties undertaking illegitimate activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.

The FATF calls remittance providers Money or Value Transfer Services (MVTS), and in its new guidance it dedicates considerable space to explaining the many business models that exist for this type of financial facility, and the ones that provide the best service for people who send and receive remittances.
FATFs Guidance is intended to assist countries, operators in the MVTS sector, as well as banks working with them, to better understand a risk-based approach to implementing measures to combat money-laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF). In a nutshell, this means that the measures to combat these ills should be commensurate with the risks they pose.
A very clear statement made in this new document is that while there may be instances when operators in this sector are abused by entities carrying out money laundering or terrorist financing, this should not necessarily result into categorisation of all MVTS providers as inherently high ML/TF risk. This is a positive sign to the MVTS sector, the banking sector, and governments who are working to avoid a broad-brush risk categorization of the sector that does not reflect the diversity of the providers.
The guidance clarifies that the overall risk of any MVTS provider is influenced by a number of factors. These include the extent and quality of the regulatory and supervisory framework, the implementation of risk-based controls, and other mitigating measures put in place by individual providers.
The FATF document also includes a section entitled  Access of MVTS to Banking Services, which confirms growing concern that banks are terminating relationships with MVTS, and is an explicit acknowledgement that this issue warrants attention at the international level. This is a timely and helpful addition to the ongoing global conversation about remittance service providers' access to bank accounts. It complements work already published by the World Bank in November 2015 concerning this topic.
The World Bank is an observer to the FATF. The majority of FATF members are developed countries, and the Bank plays an important role in providing a voice for developing countries who are not FATF members. Our team here actively provided inputs on the drafting of this Guidance, which is particularly relevant in the context of broader development agenda to achieve financial inclusion.
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which provides the detailed framework for the post-2015 development agenda, calls on the global community to address the most significant obstacles to the continued flow of remittances, including the withdrawal of banks from this business line. This guidance will help increase understanding among banks, governments, and MVTS providers as they grapple with managing risks imposed by bad actors in the system  without negatively affecting legitimate business.

883,"According to the Barometer of the Americas nearly 70 percent of Latin American interviewees admitted having been asked for a bribe in the past year. But thereâs room for hope: 86.3 percent of interviewees stressed that paying a bribe as unjustifiable, according to the same survey. In recent years Latin Americans have increasingly demanded more accountable, open and transparent governments that can readily respond to citizensâ needs. In this context, adopting transparency and accountability practices and mechanisms are essential create trust, dialogue and cooperation between institutions, private sector and civil society. These are necessary steps to boost institutions and public authoritiesâ legitimacy.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Latin America and the Caribbean has been enhancing the capacity of governments, civil society and the private sector in designing and implementing tools to improve transparency and accountabilityâessential for the regionâs democratic governance.

The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and in particularly SDG 16, explicitly link good governance with peace, justice and inclusive societies, emphasizing crisis prevention mechanisms and transparency as crucial steps for strong institutions. Empowering and promoting citizen participation is key. In our region we particularly focus on youth, women, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants, whoâin spite of the progressâstill lag behind, including in terms of political participation.But there are some innovative initiatives out there.For example, in Colombia, UNDP has supported the construction process of the Comprehensive Anti-Corruption Public Policy, in order to strengthen the tools and mechanisms to prevent, investigate and punish corruption. Working at a local level â or with a âterritorial policy approachââ we have partnered with 12 regional departments, working with state and non-stake actors to include the population in decision-making processes.

Haiti UNDP has supported the School for the Judiciary by training 190 judgesâ including from the Electoral Court, Justices of the Peace and Government Commissionsâto enhance skills, share best practices from other countries in the region and establish links and networks for South-South Cooperation.
Peru UNDP has a Transparency and Ethics in Public Institutions initiative with the Peruvian Press Council which encourages institutions at all government levels to comply with the Transparency and Access to Information Law. We train officials, promote citizen oversight and accountability. This project is conducted with special emphasis on Municipalities and Regional Governments to introduce the concepts and practices of open government, which encourages that citizens access documents and government proceeding, enabling effective public oversight, among other matters.
Costa Rica, our âTransparency and Accountability in the Associations of Rural Water Supplyâ initiative has influenced the management of drinking water and sanitation at the local level, with results seen in several communities, which now also abide to guidelines on participation, transparency and accountability. The initiative stems from UNDPâs Water Governance Facility partnership with the Stockholm International Water Institute and has led to a new implementation plan that has helped authorities apply guidelines, train staff and managers at the local and national levels with improved water management.
Chile, UNDP has supported the Commissions of Ethics and Transparency in the upper and lower houses of parliament by designing a model that improves integration, functions and procedures. Civil society has been involved in decision-making mechanisms, joining such commission and including proposals to promote integrity and transparency, as was the case of the Constitutional Act of Congress bill. This Chile-UNDP initiative was highlighted as a best practice during the Open Government Partnership Global Summit held in Mexico in October.

These examples show that countries have been advancing to adopt and promote laws and public policies that are crucial to fight corruption in crucial sectors for sustainable development. Health, water, education, environment or public safety sectors have been among the top targets, also using new communication technologies for monitoring and reporting corrupt practices.Of course there is still a long way to go. But we are moving forward towards becoming more transparent and accountable. And thatâs crystal clear Click here for original article.",0
87,"WASHINGTON â United States senators have sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting that the U.S. Department of the Treasury update the list of sanctioned persons in Zimbabwe.

In a statement, U.S. Senators Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Chris Coons, member of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, said a new sanctions list is expected to have new names and removal of other individuals.

âWhile the United States has been the top provider of humanitarian and development aid to meet the needs of Zimbabweâs people, the government of Zimbabwe has implemented a misinformation campaign blaming the countryâs woes on targeted sanctions programs implemented by the United States,â said the senators.

Senators Risch and Coons said, âGiven the developments in Zimbabwe over the last two years, we urge you to consider enhancing the tools at your disposal, including the use of targeted sanctions, to incentivize changes in behavior by the Government of Zimbabwe.

âAn update to the list of the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list should incorporate a balance of new designations with appropriate removals.â

They further said, âit is important that the United States communicate to the people of Zimbabwe that our sanctions programs are aimed at deterring human rights abuses, public corruption, the undermining of democratic processes or institutions, and political repression in Zimbabwe. They are not aimed at the Zimbabwean people.

According to the Foreign Relations Committee, in 2003, the United States began to impose sanctions on select individuals in the ZANU-PF regime and entities known to facilitate human rights abuses, undermine the rule of law, and engage in the looting of state resources for personal or political gain.

It says while the targeted sanctions have been in place, the U.S. has continued to invest in humanitarian and development aid for Zimbabwe, spending more than $2 billion over the last 10 years. âThe government of Zimbabwe has used misinformation to blame U.S. sanctions for the countryâs political, economic and humanitarian situation.â

President Emmerson Mnangagwa has roped in the Southern African Development Community in seeking the removal of the targeted sanctions.",0
374,"A trove of documents obtained by German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung has shed light on how co-founders of an intensely nebulous, Bermuda-based offshore investment vehicle, Meridian Capital, obtained generous loans from a major Kazakhstani bank whose survival was only made possible by multibillion dollar government bailouts.

That is among multiple revelations in an article published over the weekend by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP  one in a consortium of outlets poring through 6.8 million confidential records leaked from Bermuda law firm Appleby, which handled paperwork for Meridian, a highly diversified entity involved in the energy, real estate, mining, banking, aviation and transportation sectors.

In another explosive detail, the OCCRP reported the hitherto unknown fact that one of Meridians founders appears to have been Sauat Mynbayev  current chief executive of Kazakhstans state-owned KazMunaiGaz oil and gas company, and a former oil and gas minister, from 2010 to 2013.

But it is the alleged role of Kazkommertsbank that is going to cause the government most headaches in the foreseeable future.

OCCRP claimed in their report that Appleby data shows that other Meridian co-founders included top executives and shareholders of Kazkommertsbank, a lender that now operates under the Qazqom brand.

It was this bank that provided the easy credit that made Meridian an empire that now stretches from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia, and even Australia, the report noted. [The] leak reveals that the group used a large portion of the banks deposits to fund project after project. This enabled them to grow quickly, and at little risk to themselves.

But one piece of correspondence from an unidentified central bank official states that whenever Meridian projects would fail, the losses would simply be dumped onto the banks books.

This is significant as Kazkommertsbank has endured severe liquidity crises that prompted the government in March to use $7.5 billion in state funds to clear the institutions mountain of bad loans. That bailout was rushed through in advance of a merger between Kazkommertsbank and another top lender, Halyk Bank, which is controlled by President Nursultan Nazarbayevs second daughter, Dinara, and her husband, Timur Kulibayev.

The OCCRP said it was unable to estimate the extent of the damage caused to state coffers by Kazkommertsbanks lending to Meridian, but suggested that Kazakhstans citizens could be on the hook for billions of dollars.

The timing is mortifying for Nazarbayev, who publicly complained only a few days ago about purported shenanigans at RBK Bank  far smaller entity than Kazkommertsbank. Shady practices at that lender, the president said, has culminated in accountholders being unable to access their savings.

Thieves should go to jail, which is where they will be sent, Nazarbayev said on November 3, speaking to a congress of the ruling Nur Otan party.

Unlike for Kazkommertsbank, there has been no talk yet of a bailout for RBK.

Still, Kazkommertsbank is likely to be shielded from excessively nosy coverage in local media, which is almost all largely loyal to the authorities. On November 6, some online outlets had cursorily referred to the OCCRP report and the wider document leak, which has been branded Paradise Papers, but without dwelling on any of the specific details or mentioning the Kazkommertsbank connection. Almost all local reports are straight pick-ups of a sweeping article on Paradise Papers by Russias TASS news agency.

The government will likely be actively engaged in containing the damage.

When unsubstantiated rumors began spreading last week, via a popular mobile phone communicator app, about Kazkommertsbank being on the verge of bankruptcy, the bank was swift to put out a statement of denial.

To protect the interests of the bank, we have filed a statement with law enforcement bodies with the aim of finding the source disseminating the rumor, Kazkommertsbank said in its statement.

As of the late afternoon on November 6, Mynbayev had yet to make a public statement about a report that identified him as once controlling 18.75 percent of Meridian. The OCCRP supported that claim by citing a 2006 document that named Askar Alshinbayev, Yevgeniy Feld, Nurzhan Subkhanberdin, Nina Zhussupova, Azat Abishev and Ian Connor as the other shareholders. OCCRP cited a much more recent UK disclosure by Meridian as naming Alshinbayev, Subkhanberdin and Feld as beneficiaries, but not Mynbayev.

Meridian certainly seems to have proven lucrative for its owners.

Previously leaked notes from a 2005 meeting between Connor and officials with HSBC has the Meridian shareholder estimating the companys assets at around $1.2 billion.

In that meeting, Connor  said he had received a $9 million dividend payment from the group the previous month, OCCRP reported.

Connor said Meridians investment ranged included Kazakhstani gold and oil companies and a mine in South Africa.

As OCCRP has documented, the chronology of Meridians rise appears to closely track successes in Mynbayevs career. Meridian was founded in 2002. The following year, Mynbayev was appointed deputy prime minister. In 2006, he took over as head of the Samruk sovereign wealth fund. From 2007 through to 2013, he was charged with ministerial portfolios that gave him ample responsibilities over the countrys energy sector. That role became even more explicit in 2013, when he took over the helm at KazMunaiGaz.",0
581,"LOS ANGELES  A 252-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed today charges 80 defendants, most of whom are Nigerian nationals, with participating in a massive conspiracy to steal millions of dollars through a variety of fraud schemes and launder the funds through a Los Angeles-based money laundering network.

The indictment was unsealed after law enforcement authorities this morning arrested 14 defendants across the United States, with 11 of those arrests taking place in the Los Angeles region. Two defendants were already in federal custody on other charges, and one was arrested earlier this week. The remaining defendants are believed to be abroad, with most them located in Nigeria.

The indictment alleges that the 80 defendants and others used various online fraud schemes  including business email compromise (BEC) frauds, romance scams, and schemes targeting the elderly  to defraud victims out of millions of dollars. According to a criminal complaint also unsealed today, co-conspirators based in Nigeria, the United States and other countries contacted the lead defendants in the indictment  Valentine Iro, 31, of Carson, and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe, 38, of Gardena, both Nigerian citizens  for bank and money-service accounts that could receive funds fraudulently obtained from victims. Once members of the conspiracy convinced victims to send money under false pretenses, Iro and Igbokwe coordinated the receipt of funds and oversaw an extensive money-laundering network, according to the 145-page indictment.

The indictment and criminal complaint allege that Iro and Igbokwe, who were among those arrested this morning, were involved in schemes resulting in the fraudulent transfer of at least $6 million in fraudulently-obtained funds  and the overall conspiracy was responsible for the attempted theft of at least an additional $40 million.

The fraudsters targeted victims in the United States and across the globe, including individuals, small and large businesses, and law firms. Some of the victims of the conspiracy lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fraud schemes, and many were elderly.

This case is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Americans from fraudulent online schemes and to bring to justice those who prey upon American citizens and businesses, said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. Today, we have taken a major step to disrupt criminal networks that use BEC schemes, romance scams and other frauds to fleece victims. This indictment sends a message that we will identify perpetrators  no matter where they reside  and we will cut off the flow of ill-gotten gains.

Todays announcement highlights the extensive efforts that organized criminal groups will engage in to perpetrate BEC schemes that target American citizens and their hard-earned assets, said Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office. Billions of dollars are lost annually, and we urge citizens to be aware of these sophisticated financial schemes to protect themselves or their businesses from becoming unsuspecting victims. The FBI is committed to working with our partner agencies worldwide to continue to identify these cyber criminals and to dismantle their networks.

Iro and Igbokwe essentially were brokers of fraudulent bank accounts. According to the indictment, Iro and Igbokwe collected bank accounts, fielded requests for bank account information, provided that information to co-conspirators around the world, and laundered the money obtained from victims  all of this in exchange for a cut of the money stolen from victims of the various fraud schemes.

If a bank account with a specific business name was required to trick a business-victim into making a payment, Iro and Igbokwe often coordinated with money mules to open accounts that could receive funds obtained, according to court documents. In addition to making the fake business name mirror the name of a legitimate company, members of the conspiracy routinely filed fictitious business name statements with the Los Angeles County Registrar/Recorders Office that were presented to banks when the fraudulent accounts were opened.

Once a victim deposited funds into a bank account or a money services account, Iro and Igbokwe allegedly coordinated with others to further launder the funds. Members of the conspiracy sometimes wired funds to other bank accounts under their control; in other cases, they simply withdrew funds as cash or negotiable instruments such as cashiers checks.

When stolen funds were withdrawn as cash, the defendants frequently used illicit money exchangers to move funds overseas, generally avoiding transferring the funds directly through banking institutions, the indictment alleges. To do this, Iro and Igbokwe coordinated the transfer of a victims funds from a fraudulent bank account they controlled to U.S. bank accounts belonging to illicit money exchangers. Those money exchangers, in turn, used a Nigerian banking application to transfer other funds in naira (?), the currency of Nigeria, from Nigerian bank accounts they controlled to the Nigerian bank accounts specified by Iro and Igbokwe. This method was used to transfer millions of dollars to Nigerian co-conspirators without directly transferring funds overseas. The indictment alleges that Jerry Ikogho, 50, of Carson (who was taken into custody on Sunday), and Adegoke Moses Ogungbe, 34, of Fontana, were among those who served as illicit money exchangers for the conspiracy.

Each of the 80 defendants named in the indictment is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft. A number of the defendants also face substantive fraud and money laundering charges.

Additionally, Iro, Igbokwe, Ikogho, Ogungbe and three other defendants Izuchukwu Kingsley Umejesi, 30, of Los Angeles, Tityaye Marina Mansbangura, 33, of Palmdale, and Obi Madekwe, 31, of Nigeria  are charged with operating illegal money transmitting businesses. Ogungbe and Mansbangura were also among those arrested this morning, and Umejesi is a fugitive currently being sought by authorities.

Iro, Igbokwe and Chuks Eroha, 39, face additional charges for attempting to destroy their phones when the FBI executed a search warrant in July 2017. Iro also is charged with lying to the FBI in an interview conducted during the search. The complaint alleges that, when the FBI arrived to conduct the court-authorized search at Iros apartment in Carson, Iro broke his phone in half, while Igbokwe and Eroha threw phones from a bedroom window of the apartment. While Iro claimed he previously had broken the phone during an argument with his wife, the complaint details how the FBI was able to determine that the phone was operational until seconds after the FBI knocked on Iros apartment door to execute the search warrant. Eroha is believed to have fled to Nigeria shortly after the FBI executed the warrant.

The charges contained in the criminal complaint and indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.

This investigation is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office, the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, and the U.S. Department of States Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) provided substantial assistance during the investigation.

Several agencies provided support during todays takedown or during the investigation, including the United States Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Ventura County District Attorneys Office and the California Franchise Tax Board.

Many of the FBIs Legal Attachés provided assistance throughout this investigation, as did the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, and foreign authorities around the world. In particular, the FBI and U.S. Attorneys Office thank the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom and the Public Prosecutors Office of Osnabrück, Germany for their contributions.

This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Anil J. Antony and Joseph B. Woodring of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section.

The FBI in 2017 issued a report on the rise of BEC schemes, and published a recap of 2018s Operation WireWire, which was an international effort to disrupt international BEC scams. An FBI public service announcement that warns of the dangers of BEC schemes encourages businesses to trust but verify.",1
1042,"Gaston Alfonso Browne (born 9 February 1967) is the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He has been the islands' leader since 2014. Before entering politics, he was a banker and businessman.

Browne was born on 9 February 1967, in Villa/Point Area on the twin island of Antigua and Barbuda. [2] [3] His life as a teenager was extremely tough. As a child, he lived in Gray's Farm with his paternal great-grandmother, who was in her eighties, at the time, partially blind, poor and aging. After her passing, he later grew up in Point, another impoverished area. [2]

As a child, he attended the Villa Primary School and later the Princess Margaret School after successfully passing the nation's common entrance examination. After completing his secondary education, Gaston attended the City Banking College in the United Kingdom, where he graduated with a BSc in banking and finance. Later, he attended University of Manchester, acquiring an MBA in Finance. [4] [5] [6]

Career[ edit ]

Following graduation Browne secured a position with the Swiss American Banking Group, a major banking consortium in Antigua and Barbuda, comprising offshore and onshore banks and a trust company, eventually rising to the position of Commercial Banking Manager.

He entered the political arena in 1999, when he was elected to parliament for the constituency of St. John's City West. He was appointed Minister of Planning, Trade, Industry, Commerce and Public Service Affairs in his first term as an MP. [ citation needed ]

Prime Minister[ edit ]

Gaston Browne led the Antigua Labour Party to victory in the 12 June 2014 general election, after 10 years in opposition, winning 14 out of 17 seats. Browne was sworn in as Prime Minister on 13 June 2014. [7] He defeated Baldwin Spencer 's UPP, which had ruled for 10 years.

Aftermath of Hurricane Irma[ edit ]

On 6 September 2017 Hurricane Irma swept through Barbuda. Gaston Browne stated that the Category 5 storm had destroyed 95% of the structures and vehicles. [8] Initial estimates showed that at least 60% of the island's residents were homeless because of the disaster. [9] All communications with Barbuda were completely down for a time; most of the communications system had been destroyed. [10]

On 8 September 2017, Browne described the situation as follows during an interview. ""Barbuda right now is literally a rubble"" with no water or phone service; he said there had been only a single fatality. [11] The government had almost completed the evacuation of the entire island; nearly 1,800 people were transferred to Antigua. [12]

On the same day, the first of three cargo planes arrived from the US, with over 120,000 pounds of relief for Barbuda. The cost was covered by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and by donations from Martin Franklyn and the Coleman Company in the US. [13] Also on 8 September, Browne discussed Barbuda's urgent needs with Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for International Development. USAID had already sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team and would continue to coordinate with the government and relief organizations. [14]

Browne's government was facing a massive challenge. An estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Antigua and Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that ""all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent  food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management"". He summarised the situation as follows: ""Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety ... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this."" [15]

Browne is married to Maria Bird-Browne, niece of the second Prime Minister Lester Bird. [16] The couple have a son, Prince Gaston Browne, [5] who was Browne's fourth child, as he had three children prior to marriage. They had a second child, a daughter, in September 2020. [17]

On 11 December, it was announced that Maria would stand as a candidate for Antigua Labour Party in the St John's Rural East constituency. [18] She won the seat in the March 2018 election. [19]",0
712,"Global money mover Western Union is commonly a target for fintech companies, but the firm is teaming up with a startup to help increase its presence in the worldâs third-most lucrative remittance market: the Philippines.

Coins, the Manila-based fintech startup that was recently acquired by $10 billion ride-hailing company Go-Jek, said today that it will integrate Western Union, which is valued at $8 billion on the NYSE, into its app to allow Philippines-based users to receive money sent to them from overseas.

The Philippines is a mighty country when it comes to money transfers. There are some 10 million Philippine nationals based overseas and a recent World Bank report ranked the company the worldâs third-most lucrative corridor with an estimated $34 billion sent home from overseas last year. (Thatâs the same as Mexico, with India and China in first and second place, respectively.)

The partnership means Coins users â the company claims five million downloads to date â who receive money via Western Union wonât need to trudge out and wait in line to collect it. Instead, it can be remitted to the Coins app, from where it can be transferred on to other people (peer-to-peer transfers are free) or used on the Coins platform for other payments. Money in the app can be used to pay for utility bills, mobile top-up, public transport trips and at merchants that support its payment service.

One thing the alliance doesnât do, however, is remove Western Union fees, but Coins founder and CEO Ron Hose is optimistic that the deal brings value for both parties and consumers in the Philippines.

âOur mission is working with banks and financial service providers to bring services to people who donât have access,â he told TechCrunch in an interview.

Hose declined to comment on Western Union payments â which are routinely seized upon by startups that look to offer more transparent and cheaper overseas transfers â but, in theory, moving money digitally could pave the way for retail-based remitters, like Western Union, to reduce operational costs and potentially make their service cheaper for consumers in the future.

Western Union already operates its own apps, but, like a number of âold schoolâ global money platforms, its business is inherently a retail one rather than a tech one. Thatâs because it has a strong physical presence â with more than 500,000 location worldwide and some 12,000 in the Philippines alone â which brings with it operational costs, while there is also KYC and other anti-laundering processes that increase expenditure.

It remains to be seen where the Coins-Western Union deal will head. Parent company Go-Jek is busily expanding into Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore while it has a strong base in its native Indonesia, so there could be potential for further alliances in the future.

The Philippines is part of the broad âMiddle East, Africa, and South Asiaâ region in Western Unionâs financial reporting. The company reported flat growth in the region last year, with it accounting for 15 percent of all revenue. It grossed $1.4 billion in sales in the final quarter, but that was down three percent year-on-year. On the positive side, Western Union said its online service grew to 12 percent of consumer sales in the quarter â deals like the Coins partnership are aimed at finding its digital future.",0
744,"Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente admitted on Tuesday that the passing of the new immigration law could just be the last remaining solution to resolve nagging corruption problem festering the agency.

In a news statement issued on Tuesday morning, Morente said the current Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 is no longer responsive to the concerns and needs of the Bureau of Immigration.

Morente earlier lamented of not having disciplinary powers over BI personnel, as âthe power to hire and fireâ rests with the Secretary of Justice.

âI have talked to the President and raised this concern to him as well. The Philippine Immigration Act is a very old law, 80 years old to be exact. It was enacted during a time when there were no international flights yet entering and leaving the country,â Morente pointed out.

âMany of its provisions are already outdated and inappropriate already,â he added.

The enactment by Congress of the Philippine Immigration Act, according to Morente, will be the long-term solution to the corruption problem in the bureau.

He said the passage of the said law is part of the three-tier approach that the BI has framed to solve corruption and other irregularities in the bureau.

For short-term solution, the BI has implemented a one-strike policy against BI personnel who are subjects of meritorious complaints, or issues, pending the filing of appropriate administrative charges.

âThe short-term solution is to relieve all those found to have been involved in corrupt practices, hence, we relieved all names implicated in the âPastillasâ issue, and implemented a one-strike policy for anyone who tries to follow suit,â he stated.

The medium-term solution, on the other hand, is the continuous reorganization of the system.

âTo add layers of checks and balances, we have transferred the supervision of the Travel Control and Intelligence Unit and the Border Control and Intelligence unit under a different division. This will serve as a sort of audit to the actions of those in the Port Operations Division, and dismantles any semblance of a central control of possible illegal activities. It adds more eyes watching and auditing the activities of airport personnel,â he added.

Morente said both the short term and medium term remedies are now being implemented.

However, the BI chief expressed belief that the real and long-term solution against corruption is the updating of the Philippine Immigration Act.

âWe can remove people again and again, but the loopholes in the law remain. Quick wins may cure some symptoms in the anti- corruption drive but a responsive new immigration law may yet cure systemic problems that breed corruption,â Morente explained.

The new law which is now being prioritized by Congress is expected to address salary woes, remove systemic issues, plug loopholes in policies, update fines and penalties, ensure division of power, and confer to the Commissioner the proper disciplinary powers.

It would also likely lead to the increase in fines to be imposed against airlines who will be caught bringing in improperly documented aliens.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said at a news briefing on Tuesday that the government is now eyeing the âmodernizationâ of the BI to mitigate corrupt practices in the said agency.

Roque said Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra appealed to Congress to finally pass the bill amending the already outdated Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, which created Commission on Immigration and Deportation (CID), which was later renamed to BI.

âSecretary [Guevarra] proposed the passage of the law updating and modernizing the law creating CID since it a Commonwealth Act,â Roque said.

This was confirmed by Guevarra to BusinessMirror in an SMS.

âThe bills for the modernization of BI is already in the committee level in both house chambers so it needs more push [to be passed into law],â Guevarra said. With Samuel P. Medenilla",0

47,"â -- A 27-year-old New York City-area woman has been accused of stealing and laundering more than $85,000, using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to support ISIS, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

Zoobia Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of money laundering. The five-count indictment was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York.

""The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" the DOJ explained in a statement. ""She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (""ISIS"") ... After consummating the scheme, the defendant attempted to leave the United States and travel to Syria. Shahnaz, a U.S citizen, was arrested yesterday.""

According to court records, Shahnaz worked as a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June of this year Around January of 2016, the government says she volunteered in Jordan with the Syrian American Medical Society.

Part of her volunteer work took her to a refugee camp where prosecutors said ""ISIS exercises significant influence.""

But Steve Zissou, an attorney assigned by the judge to represent Shahnaz, told Newsday that she never tried to help ISIS. He said she wanted to help Syrian refugees she met while volunteering.

""Whatever she did was for humanitarian purposes only,"" Zissou said.

Shahnaz is accused of fraudulently obtaining six credit cards and a loan from a Manhattan bank to procure more than $85,000 which prosecutors allege she then converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and laundered the money through overseas transfers, all with an intent to financially support ISIS. Prosecutors say the financial institutions she defrauded include American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Discover Bank and TD Bank.

Having never told her family she had quit her job in June, she attempted to board a flight at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport for Pakistan on July 31, with a layover in Turkey.

She was questioned by law enforcement officials at the airport, since her itinerary was suspect. Prosecutors said they believe she was trying to leave the U.S. for Syria and join ISIS.

""Her itinerary included a multi-day layover in Istanbul, Turkey -- a common point of entry for individuals traveling from Western countries to join ISIS in Syria,"" a court document stated. ""The defendant's return ticket had been booked for September 4, 2017 on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to JFK.""

But investigators believe Shahnaz had no plans to return to the U.S. She had allegedly done Internet searches for ""one-way tickets to Istanbul"" but purchased a roundtrip ticket. Prosecutors point out that ISIS recommends those wishing to travel to join ISIS to buy roundtrip tickets because they might be deemed less suspicious by law enforcement agents.

Agents said she gave false and conflicting explanations about her overseas wire transfers. She was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors want her held without bail pending trial.

Her next court date is January 5, 2018.",1
627,"PORTLAND, Ore.Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, announced today the indictment of three people for their roles in a complex scheme to launder proceeds from the sale of illegal narcotics by facilitating the transfer of bulk cash from Mexican drug trafficking organizations to Chinese nationals residing in the U.S.

Shefeng Su, 39, Xinhua Li Yan, 39, and Xiancong Su, 46, are each charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Shefeng Su and Li Yan were residents of Portland during the timeframe alleged in the indictment.

According to the indictment, the defendants money laundering scheme was designed to remedy two separate problems: drug trafficking organizations inability to repatriate drug proceeds into the Mexican banking system and wealthy Chinese nationals restricted by Chinas capital flight laws from transferring large sums of money held in Chinese bank accounts for use abroad.

The first group, drug traffickers, are challenged by their inability to transport U.S. currency acquired from the sale of illegal narcotics in the U.S. to Mexico while avoiding detection by law enforcement and Mexican banking regulators. Mexicos anti-money laundering regulations limit the amount of cash deposits of U.S. dollars that Mexican financial institutions can receive. As a result, drug trafficking organizations work with professional money launderers to bundle and sell bulk U.S. dollars in order to convert them to pesos, a more readily depositable currency in Mexico.

The second group, Chinese nationals living outside China, are challenged by Chinas limit on the amount of personal funds that can be transferred out of Chinese bank accounts for use in a foreign country. Currently, China limits these transfers to $50,000 per year. As a result, some Chinese nationals have a need to acquire large quantities of U.S. dollars via other means.

The defendants scheme facilitated the transfer of cash between these two groups. Their money laundering organization would facilitate the transfer of funds from the buyers Chinese bank account to another Chinese bank account held by the money laundering organization. Once the Chinese renminbi (RMB) were transferred between these bank accounts, the funds were repatriated back to Mexico and converted to pesos to complete the money laundering cycle. This scheme has been described by some as the Chinese Underground Banking System.

All three defendants are at-large and believed to be outside the U.S.This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Oregon.

An indictment is only an accusation of a crime, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",1

833,"San Francisco: Microsoft has introduced a new platform security technology to prevent data corruption techniques being adopted by cybercriminals to target system security policy and tamper with data structures on Windows 10 devices.

Called Kernel Data Protection (KDP), the technology prevents data corruption attacks by protecting parts of the Windows kernel and drivers through virtualization-based security (VBS).

According to the company, KDP is a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that provide the ability to mark some kernel memory as read-only, preventing attackers from ever modifying protected memory.

âFor example, weâve seen attackers use signed but vulnerable drivers to attack policy data structures and install a malicious, unsigned driver. KDP mitigates such attacks by ensuring that policy data structures cannot be tampered with,â the tech giant said in a statement this week.

The concept of protecting kernel memory as read-only has valuable applications for the Windows kernel, inbox components, security products, and even third-party drivers like anti-cheat and digital rights management (DRM) software.

KDP uses technologies that are supported by default on Secured-core PCs, which implement a specific set of device requirements that apply the security best practices of isolation and minimal trust to the technologies that underpin the Windows operating system.

âIt enhances the security provided by the features that make up Secured-core PCs by adding another layer of protection for sensitive system configuration data,â said Microsoft.",0
666,"Nasdaq has announced the launch of the cloud-deployed Nasdaq Automated Investigator for AML, the first automated solution for investigating anti-money laundering (AML) for retail and commercial banks and other financial institutions. Designed, built and offered in partnership with UK-based Caspian. Nasdaq Automated Investigator for AML further expands Nasdaqâs global efforts in combatting financial crime and promoting market integrity in the capital markets and beyond.

âThe financial industry is making a structural shift to more intelligent technologies and real-time adaptive analytics based on much larger, more diverse data pools to detect and investigate financial crime,â said Valerie Bannert-Thurner, SVP and Head of Sell-side and Buy-side Solutions, Market Technology, Nasdaq. âAs both a market operator and technology provider, we have a commitment to the capital market ecosystem to keep markets healthy and safe to fight financial crime. Through the years of expertise we have gained as an industry leader in trade surveillance, we are both moving beyond our alerting capabilities to investigation, and expanding our solutions to help eradicate illegal money transactions.â

The Automated Investigations Management space is a historically underserviced area of financial crime operations that presents a significant gap in the investigations management process for banks. Many techniques are used to launder money, causing banks to cast a wide net to catch perpetrators. The wide scope of surveillance means AML Transaction Monitoring (AMLTM) systems could potentially trigger as many as 200,000 to 300,000 alerts a month in extreme cases. In response, many banks have tightened the parameters within their AMLTM systems or added additional scoring mechanisms, thereby reducing alerts. However, when banks tune their models too tightly, they run the risk of missing criminal activity and exposing themselves to regulatory sanction. Even those that have tightened their parameters can experience 20,000 to 25,000 alerts in a month.

To support these efforts, the Nasdaq Automated Investigator ingests alert data from any transaction monitoring system, collates all of the necessary data required for analysis, analyzes the data and then replicates complex human decision making to provide a clear, auditable justification for all alerts regardless of volume, and in seconds. The technology is powered by multiple variants of artificial intelligence including both supervised and unsupervised learning in conjunction with business rules to provide a significant increase in operational efficiency. Beyond AML, Nasdaq sees broad applicability for this new category of solutions that the Nasdaq Automated Investigator has established, and plans to roll out functionality across complementary financial crime segments in the future.

âWe have designed the Nasdaq Automated Investigator to automate the complex stages of an alert investigation process with tools focused on the mechanics and effectiveness of the actual investigation,â said Darren Innes, Head of AML Technology, Sell-Side and Buy-Side Solutions, Nasdaq. âOur solution improves the manually intensive anti-financial crime process by fully automating all stages of the existing manual alert investigation process to deliver accurate, consistent decision-making at scale. This pinpoints the highest-probability of nefarious activity for analysts to prioritize, and provides them a layer of demonstrable explainability that does not currently exist in financial crime investigations.â

Nasdaqâs market technology powers more than 250 of the worldâs market infrastructure organizations and market participants, including broker-dealers, exchanges, clearinghouses, central securities depositories and regulators, in over 50 countries with end-to-end, mission-critical technology solutions.",0
518,"An Italian mafia super fugitive, Marco Di Lauro, has been arrested in Naples after over 14 years on the run.

Di Lauro (38) was arrested without a fight on Saturday at a modest apartment where he lived with his wife in the citys Chiaiano district, police said. He was sitting with his two cats and eating pasta when police arrested him in an operation involving around 150 officers.

The Naples police chief, Antonio De Iesu, told a press conference unusual activity had led police to the suspect, previously convicted of criminal association. Police found no weapons and a small sum of money in the flat.

An international arrest warrant was issued for Di Lauro in 2006, and he was one of Italys four most-wanted criminals, according to the interior ministry website. He is the fourth son of Paolo Di Lauro, the former boss of a clan of the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia.

Italian media said Marco Di Lauro was considered the second-most dangerous man in Italy, after the Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro.

The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, tweeted his thanks to the police for the arrest of the super fugitive. The interior minister, Matteo Salvini, voiced congratulations for a very important operation.

The high-profile arrest was reportedly linked to the murder earlier in the day of the wife of a man linked to Di Lauro, Salvatore Tamburrino.

Tamburrino handed himself in for shooting dead his wife, Norina Mattuozzo, shortly before Di Lauros arrest. De Iesu refused to confirm or deny a link between the murder and Di Lauros arrest.

Di Lauro had been on the run since escaping a police swoop in 2004 known as the night of the handcuffs. An informant said in 2010 that Di Lauro was responsible for at least four murders.

Paolo Di Lauro has been in prison since 2005, and Marco had reportedly taken over running the much-weakened clan. At least 130 people were killed in a bloody power struggle after the Amato-Pagano clan split from the Di Lauro clan in 2004.

Marco Di Lauro, reportedly known within the family by the code F4 for fourth son, had nine brothers and one sister. All the brothers are now either in prison or dead, Italian newspapers reported.  AFP",1

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said this while speaking at the ceremonial parade held on the occasion of National Unity Day at the police lines here on Saturday.

On the occasion, the chief minister also presented a trophy and cheque for Rs 1 lakh to the Pokhri police station for being selected as the Stateâs best police station. He also awarded various medals to personnel of the police for commendable work in the spheres of fire fighting, investigation and others.

Speaking on the occasion, the CM said Patel struggled for long for the nationâs independence. After independence, with his strong will power he was able to unite and merge the princely states with the nation.

Unity is vital for the strength of any nation, state and force. The strength of society also increases with unity, said Rawat. He said with the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Patelâs vision of âEk Bharat Shreshth Bharatâ is being achieved. The fight which the nation fought against Covid under the PMâs leadership has become an example for the world.

Today, the nation has succeeded to a considerable extent in tackling the Covid pandemic. Every section of society cooperated fully for protection from Covid. However, till Covid is brought fully under control, all need to maintain full alertness. The CM further stressed on the need for uniting in the fight against corruption.

Mafia elements are trying to make inroads in the state whether it be through their illegal activities focused on drugs, mining or forests. The people need to unite and fight against such elements. The State Government is committed to rid the state of the mafia and Patelâs life will provide inspiration and strength in this endeavour, added the CM.

16,"ATLANTA - Mitzi Bickers has been arraigned on 11 federal charges including conspiring to commit bribery, wire fraud, money-laundering, federal obstruction and tax fraud. Bickers was indicted by a federal grand jury on March 27, 2018.

âCity of Atlanta contracts always should go to the most qualified bidder through a contracting process that is fair and transparent,â said U.S. Attorney Byung J. âBJayâ Pak. âInstead, Mitzi Bickers allegedly conspired to use her influence as a high-ranking City of Atlanta official and later as a connected political consultant to steer lucrative city contracts to Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr., Charles P. Richards, Jr., and their companies through bribery. The illicit arrangement netted over $2 million in bribes for Bickers and almost $17 million in city contracts for Mitchell and Richards, and has shaken the publicâs trust in the cityâs contracting process.â

âThe actions of Bickers, alleged in this indictment, traded the publicâs trust in a fair bidding process for personal gain,â said David J. LeValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. âThe FBI and its partners in law enforcement will not tolerate those who choose to try to influence established and proper government procedures.â

âPublic officials need to be reminded of the trust and duty bestowed upon them by the taxpayers to serve the publicâs interest not their own,â said Thomas J. Holloman, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation. âWhen public officials and those seeking to do business with them break this trust by committing fraud, they will be charged to the fullest extent of the law.â

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: As the City of Atlantaâs Director of Human Services and after leaving employment with the city, Bickers allegedly conspired with contractors Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr. and Charles P. Richards, Jr. to accept bribe payments for herself and other public officials in exchange for the her agreement to obtain city contracts for Mitchellâs and Richardsâ companies. Both Mitchell and Richards have pleaded guilty to paying bribes to Bickers and are currently serving federal prison sentences for their crimes.

In 2009, Bickers worked on the mayoral campaign and began working for the City of Atlanta after the election. From February 2010 to May 22, 2013, Bickers served as the City of Atlantaâs Director of Human Services. Beginning in 2010, Mitchell and Richards agreed to pay bribes to Bickers to secure profitable City of Atlanta contracts for their businesses. At times, the bribe payments allegedly were referred to as âup-front money.â In reality, Mitchell and Richards often paid Bickers when their companies actually received City of Atlanta contract work.

In exchange for the bribe payments, Bickers promised to represent Mitchell, Richards and their companies on matters relating to City of Atlanta contracting, even though she was a high-level city employee at the time. Bickers also allegedly provided Mitchell and Richards with sensitive contracting information during the critical time when they were bidding on city contracts. Between 2010 and 2013, Mitchellâs and Richardâs companies received multi-million dollar contracts with the city for snow removal, sidewalk repair and maintenance, and bridge reconstruction.

In effort to conceal her relationship with Mitchell and Richards, Bickers allegedly filed numerous false City of Atlanta Financial Disclosure Forms. For example, in 2011, Bickers swore under penalty of perjury that she had no financial relationships with any outside businesses, even though Mitchellâs and Richardsâ companies paid her over $650,000 in that year. She used much of this money to purchase a $775,000 lakefront home in Jonesboro, Georgia, making a down payment of over a half million dollars. In that same year, Bickers also allegedly claimed on her taxes that she made only $57,896 as a city employee, resulting in a $3,924 tax refund from the IRS.

In 2013, Bickersâ financial ties to the Pirouette Companies came to light and Bickers resigned her position with the City of Atlanta. After her resignation, Bickers, Mitchell, and Richards allegedly continued the bribery scheme. For example, Bickers helped Mitchell secure a multi-million dollar contract for snow and debris removal work after a snowstorm locked down Atlanta in 2014. In turn, Mitchell paid Bickers and companies associated with her hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. Bickers spent the proceeds of the bribery at stores like Gucci and on expensive vacations, home renovations, four Yamaha WaveRunners, a sports utility vehicle and an ATV. Bickers is also charged with money laundering for purchasing an SUV and four WaveRunners with bribery proceeds from an account held by the Bickers Group, which was her political consulting company.

Ultimately, between 2010 and 2015, Mitchell and Richards allegedly paid Bickers and companies associated with her over $2 million in an attempt get City of Atlanta contracts through bribery. In this same period, the City of Atlanta paid Mitchellâs and Richardsâ businesses approximately $17 million for the government contracts they secured.

In September 2015, Mitchell began cooperating with FBIâs investigation into corruption at City Hall. On September 11, 2015 at approximately 5:30 a.m., Shandarrick Barnes threw a concrete block reading âER, keep your mouth shut!â through a plate glass window in Mitchellâs home. Bickers is alleged to have played a role in this attempt to obstruct the federal investigation. Barnes will be sentenced by District Court Judge Steven C. Jones on April 9, 2018.

Mitzi Bickers, 51, of Atlanta, Georgia, was arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Russell G. Vineyard. Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges. The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the governmentâs burden to prove the defendantâs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

150,"A California couple pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to commit mail fraud and tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departmentâs Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. for the Southern District of California.

According to court documents and statements made in court, married couple Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill operated On Your Feet (OYF), also known as Family Resource Center, a tax-exempt charitable organization whose stated mission was to provide assistance to low income families and individuals in need. From 2011 through 2016, the Hills fraudulently obtained more than $1.35 million in donated clothing and other items by falsely representing to the donors that the items would be given to needy recipients. In fact, the Hills made charitable donations of only about $13,000, sold the remaining donated items, and used the proceeds to financially enrich themselves and others. To conceal their conduct from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Hills filed false charitable tax returns for OYF and false personal tax returns that did not report the income they received from their scheme.

âThe Hills not only evaded their taxes, but they did so by abusing their companyâs tax-exempt charitable status and thereby cheated not only the public fisc but the donors and intended beneficiaries of the donations,â said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman. âAs the guilty pleas make clear, this conduct will not go unpunished.â

âI am committed to using the resources of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office in the Southern District of California to aggressively pursue fraudsters and tax cheats,â said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer Jr. for the Southern District of California. âThe conduct by Geraldine and Clayton Hill is particularly offensive because they used the benefits afforded by the 501(c)(3) status of their charity to defraud donors and conceal their profits. By abusing the generosity of companies and individuals who put their faith in the promises made by the Hills, the defendants threatened to undermine the trust and integrity underpinning charitable giving.â

âGeraldine Hill and Clayton Hill exploited the public trust and charitable giving by using their charity to solicit over $16 million in goods from hardworking businesses and falsely promising to donate those goods to assist low income families and individuals in need,â said Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. âInstead, the Hills resold the goods and profited over $1.34 million which they spent on vehicles, vacations, and entertainment, as well as personal expenses for their family members. The Hills concealed their fraud by filing false tax returns on behalf of the charity and failing to report their illicit income to the IRS. Their guilty pleas evidence the hard work of IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents to bring to justice those that defraud businesses in the name of charity, and who benefit themselves instead of serving those most in need.â

âWhile fraud is always wrong, the theft of charitable donations that were to be used to help San Diegoâs low income families is particularly disheartening,â said Acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Omer Meisel. âThis type of fraud and deceit for personal gain simply cannot be tolerated. The FBI is committed to ensuring that white collar predators donât prevent those less fortunate from receiving all the benefits that generous donors provide to seemingly legitimate non-profit organizations.â

U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 28, 2020. At sentencing, the Hills face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each mail fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. The Hills also face a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

218,"Under the terms of Executive Order 13581, the US Treasury has been seeking to locate and freeze assets associated with key organized crime kingpins, a range of Japanese, Latin American, Italian and Russian/Eurasian neâer-do-wells. On 30 October, a new set of targets was announced, including six people and four businesses âlinked to the Brothersâ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate.â Iâve written elsewhere (here and here) that I still do not believe that the Brothersâ Circle, as a specific crime group or âcoordinating bodyâ, actually exists and instead that it is aâperfectly reasonableâfiction-of-convenience to allow this Order to be applied against criminals operating within the very loose and often mutable networks of Russian/Eurasian crime.

The latest targets are all reportedly associated with two specific figures, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who were designated back in 2012, both of whom are definitely bad news and especially involved in transnational drug trafficking in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. These newer designated targets are also essentially lesser figures: agents, messengers, money-movers and the like (not a bad thing, for reasons I go into below). These are Treasuryâs claims:

Overall, Iâm a fan of this approach, especially as it now extends to associates and agents. The real aim in my opinion is not just freezing individualsâ assetsâthatâs a good thing, of courseâbut also making designated figures toxic within their networked underworld, such that no one wants to do business with them, organize joint criminal ventures, launder their money or launder money with them, for fear of their assets also getting locked. Anything that strikes at the connections that make these networks effective is very good news indeed.

On the other hand, I was quite surprised about Lepsveridze âs name being on the list, as ÐÐµÐ¿Ñ is one of Russiaâs highest grossing singers, whose music started in the Russky shanson styleârooted in criminal balladsâbut has since progressed into more mainstream directions. Of course there is nothing new about criminals and entertainers being connected, just as Frank Sinatra orâ reportedly âIosif Kobzon. But I do wonder about the political fallout that may ensue. Maybe itâs not something about which Treasury really cares (and I can see the temptation in not caring), but I suspect this will cause quite an uproar in Russia. As is, police cooperation between the USA and Russia is quite tricky and sometimes politically-complex. I do hope that this does not raise further obstacles. But that said, if Treasury are sure of their facts, then it shouldnât matter if the criminal associates are famous or not, they ought to be on the list.",1
143,"Colombiaâs public prosecution on Friday arrested President Juan Manuel Santos â top adviser on regional issues on corruption charges, just when the president was visiting one of those regions.

Carlos Ecuardo Correa, the countryâs High Counselor for the Regions, became the first sitting administration official to be arrested on corruption charges since Santos took office in 2010.

According to the Prosecutor Generalâs Office, Correa engaged in corruption practices while he was mayor of the northern Colombian city of Monteria.

The top official voluntarily reported himself at the Prosecutor Generalâs Office after hearing about his impending arrest.

The latest corruption scandal follows a series of major corruption scandals regarding illegal funds entering the presidentâs 2010 and 2014 presidential campaigns.

Not just any top official

The arrest of the presidential adviser on region-specific issues couldnât come at a worse time for Santos.

The top official is partly responsible for the region-specific implementation of a peace deal with FARC guerrillas signed in November last year and already plagued with irregularities and delays.

Moreover, due to the region-specific nature of the peace deal, billions of dollars, both Colombian and foreign investments, are flowing into Colombiaâs diverse countryside that has long suffered state neglect while the capital grew to become half the countryâs GDP.

This makes the arrest of the top adviser on such a critical element of the peace process, not just a national, but a diplomatic embarrassment for President Juan Manuel Santos.

The president is widely rejected partly due to the controversial implementation of the peace deal and partly because his apparent inability to curb corruption that has plagued the country since its inception.

Santos did not immediately respond to the arrest of his top adviser.

Santos embarrassed from Choco to Brussels

While his adviser on the regions was being read his rights, the president was in Choco, a pacific province that just weeks ago rose up over the stateâs chronic state neglect, rampant corruption and violence. Correa was Santosâ main adviser over, among others, this region.

The province has a poverty rate exceeding 60%, no paved road connecting it to the rest of the country, and is overrun by illegal armed groups that have already left more than one third of the population victim of the armed conflict.

We must prioritize the breaches between the regions, give more importance to those regions who are behind most. Of course, Choco is one of them.

President Juan Manuel Santos

Santos was harshly reminded of how Colombiaâs epidemic corruption and state neglect is causing extreme suffering among those living away from the capital by local resident Clorayne Galleo, whose expression alone spoke volumes.

Mr. Santos, look me straight in the face. This Choco you say you love I fight for day by day, while your police officers and ESMAD [riot unit] mistreat me constantly. Iâve also been a victim of the âdeath ride.â Youâre going to have to work on healthcare too.

The âdeath rideâ is is local term for a patient dying while waiting for medical treatment or searching for a hospital that is open. According to the photographer, the womanâs niece died in one of those death rides just a few months ago as the intensive care unit she needed doesnât exist in the capital of Choco.

This type of elementary deficiencies in the state system are virtually nationwide, particularly in the rural areas that have proven a perfect petri dish for illegal armed groups.

In whose pockets will the international peace aid end up?

The arrest of the counselor who was responsible exactly to reduce this kind of state neglect did not just ruin Santosâ visit to Choco, it further deteriorates a public lack of confidence in their Bogota government and undermines diplomatic confidence foreign peace funds do not disappear in the pockets of corrupt officials.

Correa has held executive positions in both government and the private sector for decades.",1

775,"The Group of States against Corruption (Greco) came to the sobering assessment in two recently published reports.

Luxembourg has not made any progress since March 2019, according to the interim compliance report by Greco which was adopted at the end of October. This report focuses on the recommendations pertaining to members of parliament, judges, and prosecutors. In total, only four out of 14 recommendations had been implemented since 2013.

Greco even identified a setback in one area. The group previously recommended that the Grand Duchy should strengthen the independency and neutrality of the public prosecutor's office. An amendment to the constitution was supposed to implement this recommendation, but due to the Christian Social People's Party's opposition to the amendment, the Chamber of Deputies is no longer able to pass it.

- Second report -

The second report deals with ""preventing corruption and promoting integrity in central governments and law enforcement agencies"".

Greco determined that Luxembourg had implemented one third of its recommendations in this area. Ten recommendations were only partially implemented, while four had so far been ignored.

The Group welcomed the introduction of declarations of potential conflicts of interest for MPs, but criticised that they were not ""illustrative, specific, and complete"" enough. Greco stressed that relations to lobbyists or conflicts of interest have to clarified.

Greco also welcomed the introduction of ""open administration"", i.e. the right of citizens to access administrative documents. The new professional ethics code for government officials, which was introduced in 2019, also received praise, with Greco's only criticism being that certain assessments of the ethics committee should be made public.

- Police force -

The report also included a very positive assessment of Luxembourg's police force. The independency of the police's General Inspectorate from the police itself, now guaranteed by law, was praised. So too was the professional ethics code for policemen, which introduced disciplinary measures for police officers who accepted gifts.

Greco also approved of the introduction of identification numbers, which made it possible to easily identify an officer while they were wearing their uniform.

In regard to the recommendations which have so far only been partially implemented or not at all, Greco demands that Luxembourg make progress in the 18 months to come.",0

A woman jailed for controlling prostitutes across the country has been ordered to pay back more than Â£400,000.

Sun Sun Wong, 45, was sentenced to five years in February 2018 for two counts of controlling prostitution for gain - and one count of money laundering.

She was caught after police posed as clients in an operation in Cambridge to safeguard vulnerable women.

Wong, of Blucher Street, Birmingham, was ordered to pay Â£442,260.50 after a proceeds of crime hearing.

At Peterborough Crown Court, Judge Matthew Lowe ordered she had three months to repay the money.

'Crime doesn't pay'

Cambridgeshire Police said that in October 2015, January 2016 and February 2016 undercover officers had arranged to meet with two women and were given an address in Midsummer Court, Cambridge.

The force said that each time they were greeted by lone women who did not have the mobile phone used to make the appointment.

In February 2016, they met a woman in Blucher Street, Birmingham.

The properties were being rented out by Wong and her mobile phone number was linked to the accounts set up in the names of various prostitutes.

Police said Wong denied any wrongdoing, claiming a woman called Anita had used her identity to carry out the crimes.

Det Con Andrew McKeane said the hearing on Thursday ""demonstrates that crime doesn't pay"".

""It has ensured that Wong will be stripped of the profit she made from her crimes, and is a fitting conclusion to the appalling offences she has committed.",1
459,"WASHINGTON: Gilead Sciences Inc has agreed to pay US$97 million to resolve US government claims it used a purportedly independent charity to pay illegal kickbacks to cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket costs for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Letairis.

The US Department of Justice said on Wednesday the settlement resolves allegations that Gilead improperly used the Caring Voice Coalition as a conduit to cover thousands of patients' co-payment obligations.

Gilead's actions enabled the Foster City, California-based drugmaker to boost revenue, ran from June 2007 to December 2010, and violated the federal False Claims Act, the department said.

That law prohibits drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs.

""Gilead used data from CVC that it knew it should not have, and effectively set up a proprietary fund within CVC to cover the co-pays of just its own drug,"" US Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said in a statement.

He said such conduct undermines Medicare's co-pay structure, which Congress meant to prevent against inflated drug prices.

Drugmakers cannot subsidise co-payments for older Americans enrolled in Medicare, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance.

Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The settlement resulted from an industrywide probe led by Lelling's office into drugmakers' support for so-called patient assistance charities.

Eleven drug companies including Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc and United Therapeutics Corp have reached more than US$1 billion of settlements with the government. Four foundations and a pharmacy have also settled.",1

The sentence is to run concurrently with shorter prison terms of 10 years for each of the three charges of money laundering and three charges of criminal breach of trust against him, the court said.

Tuesdays verdict marks the first in a string of cases against Mr. Najib over allegations he unlawfully received hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB, which he launched in 2009 to spur his countrys economy.

Mr. Najib pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in a short statement before the court Tuesday. Proceedings lasted all day and were closely watched in the Southeast Asian country where Mr. Najib continues to wield political influence. His lawyer said Mr. Najib would appeal the decision before a higher court.

536,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Frank Jensen, mayor of Denmarks capital Copenhagen for over a decade, resigned on Monday after admitting to several episodes of sexual harassment, and he apologised to the women I have offended.

Jensen, 59, who will also step down as deputy of Denmarks governing Social Democratic Party, has served as Lord Mayor of Copenhagen since 2010.

His resignation was welcomed by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, calling it the right decision in a Facebook post.

It is obvious that we in the Social Democratic Party have problems, and that needs to change now, she told local news agency Ritzau earlier on Monday.

Jensens exit came after two women, one of them employed by the Social Democrats, described being sexually harassed by Jensen in 2012 and 2017, in remarks published on Friday by daily Jyllands-Posten. They said both incidents were at social events and involved Jensen touching the women against their will.

Jensen said on Facebook he had been part of a harmful and old culture in the Social Democratic Party. I would like to apologise to the women I have offended, Jensen told a news conference on Monday.

A series of sexual harassment cases in Denmark have come to light in recent months as more women within politics, the movie industry and the media have come forward to describe incidents involving male colleagues and superiors.

Frederiksen praised Jensen for his political career spanning more than 30 years work but said insurmountable problems blocked continued political involvement.

Jensen, 59, previously served as minister of justice and minister of research in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In another high-profile case, the leader of the Danish Social Liberal Party, a key ally of the minority government, stepped down earlier this month after trying to hide having sexually harassed a female party colleague in 2012.",0
699,"UNDPâs Global Anti-Corruption Programme has published two new knowledge products on Integrating Transparency, Accountability and Anti-Corruption in COVID-19 Response and Recovery:

The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health, humanitarian or socio-economic crisis; it is also a governance crisis, testing the resilience of governance institutions and systems to support societies and economies to recover from the ramifications of COVID-19. In particular, corruption and its consequences significantly impact COVID-19 response and recovery. This Guidance Note presents UNDPâs offer in supporting countries to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in both response and recovery priorities.

To build forward better, UNDPâs Next Generation of Anti-Corruption programming aims at strengthening the role of oversight and anti-corruption institutions for sustainable development; promoting social accountability and the role of civil society; strengthening business integrity; and harnessing the benefits of technology and innovation to enhance transparency and openness. These will contribute to all five pillars of the UNâs framework on socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the recognition that effective and accountable governance systems and processes are critical for progressive socio-economic change.

Download

As the technical lead for the socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UN system, UNDP and its COs worldwide are working to assess the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economies and communities to develop and implement effective strategies for COVID-19 response and recovery. Although there is recognition that COVID-19 impacts governance systems, processes and institutions, existing socio-economic impact analyses have not specifically assessed the links between them, and in particular, the impact of corruption and a lack of transparency and accountability on COVID-19 response and recovery. These are largely due to two main challenges: a lack of knowledge and guidance on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in socio-economic impact analysis; and a lack of coordination between anti-corruption institutions and the institutions focusing on socio-economic aspects.

This guidance note thus provides a practical methodology, including checklist questions, on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in social and economic needs assessment and response in the context of COVID-19.",0
702,"An anti-terrorism law that grants sweeping powers to president Rodrigo Duterteâs government is facing mounting legal challenges, as rights groups warn the legislation signals a new, dark chapter for the Philippines.

The act, which lawyers say uses a vague and overly broad definition of terrorism, permits warrantless arrests and allows authorities to hold individuals for weeks without charge. It is to be implemented later this month, though at least six petitions against the law have already been filed in the supreme court.

The government says the powers will allow it to respond to threats by militants, but rights groups warn the law could be used to lock up peaceful critics, and may even limit access to humanitarian aid. The law passed on Friday.

âParticularly in the context of Covid, where the role of humanitarian organisations has never been more important in terms of under-serviced communities, any action that hampers work of humanitarian organisations is really irresponsible,â said Professor Fionnuala NÃ­ AolÃ¡in, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.

The law criminalises anyone who provides âmaterial supportâ to an activity that is deemed a terrorist act. Though an exemption for humanitarian groups is outlined, NÃ­ AolÃ¡in says this is too limited, and the law could have a chilling effect on agencies delivering aid.

The Philippines has faced a recent increase in coronavirus cases, prompting the government to warn a strict lockdown may be reintroduced. Infections have so far reached 50,359, a fifth of which were confirmed in the past five days. There have been 1,314 confirmed deaths.

Edre Olalia, of the National Union of Peoplesâ Lawyers, who plans to file a petition opposing the law in the supreme court, fears the law will have ramifications not just for media, activists and opposition figures, but also members of the public who express opinions online.

He compared the powers provided under the anti-terror act to âa daily martial lawâ.

âIt is unprecedented to give so much power to executive bodies,â he said. The definitions in the law, he added, are âso expansive and broad that even legitimate activity can be considered terrorismâ.

Under the law, an anti-terrorism council, appointed by the president, will have the power to designate individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. The law also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Duterte, who was urged not to rush to sign the act into law, has rejected concerns about its scope. Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation had nothing to fear, he recently told the public, adding that communists were among the terrorists. The government continues to fight a decades-long communist insurgency, as well as threats from Islamist groups, in the south of the country.

In a televised address on Wednesday, he said: âDo not be afraid if you are not a terrorist.â

NÃ­ AolÃ¡in said the term terrorism was an âinherently suspect categoryâ, however, and that the government was deliberately using the cover of counterterrorism to suppress rights.

Many fear the lawâs sweeping definitions will provide a new tool to silence those who are calling for accountability for abuses committed under Duterteâs leadership, including extrajudicial killings carried out during an anti-drug crackdown launched after his election in 2016.

âThe hand is already on the trigger and the law will provide the impetus to press the trigger,â added Olalia.

Over the past few months alone, action has been taken one of the countryâs most prominent media outlets. In June, executive editor of Rappler, Maria Ressa, a critic of Duterte, was convicted of cyber libel - over a story she did not write, and under a law that did exist at the time the article was published. Meanwhile, the countryâs largest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, which has been repeatedly threatened by the president, has been forced off air. Duterte has denied that either of these cases were politically motivated.

Among those challenging the anti-terror law are Christian Monsod and Felicitas Arroyo, who were part of a commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution. Several more groups are expected to file petitions.

The vast majority of supreme court justices are Duterte appointees. âWe will push back, we will fight back,â said Olalia.",0
262,"Two months before one of the world's largest data leaks, dubbed the Panama Papers, was made public on Sunday, Brazilian prosecutors accused the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at the center of the leak, of corruption. (The firm, whose leaked records span 40 years and make up the Panama Papers, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), issued a statement to the ICIJ denying any unlawful activities. In addition, it stated that ties to offshore companies is not an implication of wrongdoing.)

On January 27 Brazil's Federal Police, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash (""OperaÃ§Ã£o Lava Jato""), accused the firm of helping clients create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. Prosecutors alleged that the firm was using real estate company OAS Empreendimentos ImobiliÃ¡rios S/A to help cover up money made in the criminal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Six temporary arrests were made and 16 search warrants were issued. Lawyers representing those arrested denied any wrongdoing or irregularities. FORBES has been unable to reach the firm for comment. Aside from its office in Brazil, the firm also has branches in 40 other cities.

According to the ICIJ, which on Sunday began sharing information on the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca's cofounder RamÃ³n Fonseca, an adviser to Panama's president, ""took a leave of absence as presidential adviser in March after his firm was implicated in the Brazil scandal and ICIJ and its partners began to ask questions about the law firmâs practices.""

At least 29 billionaires and former billionaires have been outed for allegedly having ties to offshore wealth (see story here). No Brazilian billionaires have been named so far. According to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, several current and former Brazilian government officials belonging to almost every political party are allegedly implicated. Among them, JoÃ£o Lyra, a former deputy and once Brazil's richest parliament member according to the ICIJ, was named for not disclosing an offshore holding or Swiss bank account. According to Brazilian law, individuals are allowed to have offshore accounts as long as they are registered in the country for tax purposes. Lyra has not commented on the leak. IdalÃ©cio de Castro Rodrigues de Oliveira, a Portuguese business executive accused of allegedly supplying cash used to bribe Eduardo Cunha, the president of Brazilâs Chamber of Deputies, was also named for creating offshore companies right before the alleged bribe took place. De Oliveira didn't comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.

In addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz GalvÃ£o family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo PetrÃ³polis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz GalvÃ£o released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.

Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as âLulaâ (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and refuses to step down, claiming that she is the victim of a coup attempt by rivals.",1
939,"A user's online actions and behaviors inside of a browser can help define who they are. That's the basis of a new patent from IBM researchers designed to help limit the risk of e-commerce fraud.

""At a high-level what we have patented is the ability to help prevent fraudulent transactions before they occur,"" IBM Master Inventor Brian O'Connell told eSecurityPlanet. ""We look at a lot of Web browser metrics that we transmit to a server on the backend and before a transaction takes place. We compare the transaction to a profile based on previous interactions from the user with the website.""

Twist on Two-factor Authentication

Based on an existing profile, it is possible to make a determination on whether or not the transaction is legitimate, O'Connell explained. The system is fundamentally a form of two-factor authentication for users, he added.

The user behavior that IBM examines involves a number of different attributes. Those attributes include how long a user typically hovers their mouse over a link before it is clicked, how a user scrolls through a page, and whether he uses the page-up/page-down keyboard buttons or just the mouse wheel.

""By measuring the attributes we are able to determine how likely a person is who they say they are,"" O'Connell said.

In a two-factor system, a user needs a second password (or factor) in order to gain access to a site or service. With IBM's invention, that second factor is the user's own browser behavior. In other forms of two-factor authentication, the user is typically aware of the factor being used, explained IBM Master Inventor Keith Walker.

""In this case, people are exhibiting behaviors as they interact with a Web page entirely subconsciously,"" Walker said.

Fraud detection systems have long leveraged anomalous behavior to help identify potential fraud. Noticing if a user is making a transaction from a different location than normal is a common fraud detection tactic today. The IBM patent is complementary to the traditional approach to fraud detection, Walker said.

More Patents on the Way

""In our patent we do reference current technology, so if a user is making a transaction and it's 3 a.m. and it's atypical for them, then that is an indication fraud might be going on,"" Walker said. ""All this technology can work together.""

Walker and O'Connell originally filed the patent for a ""user-browser interaction-based fraud detection system"" in April of 2006. U.S. Patent #8,650,080 was officially granted in February of this year, though IBM is only now officially announcing the patent. Walker noted that the time it takes for patents to be granted varies and is beyond his control. That said, he added that parts of the invention are now found inside IBM's Trusteer Pinpoint technology.

IBM has many more inventions that are patent pending to further mitigate the risks of online fraud. Walker noted that there is a patent in the system now related to fraud detection on mobile devices, for example.

""We took the concept of user behavior detection and thought through how to implement the invention in a keyboard-less touchscreen interface, where user behavior is very different than on a keyboard,"" Walker said.",0

OFAC also designated five individuals for acting for or behalf of German MuÃ±oz Hoyos and six entities that are owned, controlled, or directed by MuÃ±oz and/or his associates. As a result of todayâs action, all assets of those designated that are under the jurisdiction of the United States or in the control of U.S. persons are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

âTodayâs designation aims to prevent the flow of millions of dollarsâ worth of narcotics to various Mexican and European drug trafficking organizations,â said John E. Smith, OFAC Acting Director. âWe are committed to identifying and aggressively targeting major narcotics traffickers using all tools necessary to protect the U.S. financial system from the malign influence of narcotics traffickers and the laundering of their illicit proceeds.â

German MuÃ±oz Hoyos

German MuÃ±oz Hoyos, a Colombian national who also holds Mexican citizenship, is the leader of an international drug trafficking organization that is responsible for the coordination and distribution of multi-ton quantities of narcotics from Central and South America to North America and Europe.

The business holdings of German MuÃ±oz Hoyos designated today are Avical S.A., a poultry and egg production company headquartered in Manizales, Caldas, Colombia; the Colombian investment company Inversiones La Plata M & M, S. en C.A. (a.k.a. Inversiones La Plata M Y M); and four shell companies incorporated in Panama â Romik, S.A., Gemuho Holding, Inc., Unirefriclima, S.A., and Munsa International Investments, S.A. In addition, OFAC designated Carlos Ivan Munoz Hoyos, Jonathan Munoz Mejia, Jhonny German Munoz Mejia, Eliana Munoz Mejia, and Claudia Julieta Murillo Salazar, key family members who operate businesses on behalf of German Munoz Hoyos.

Todayâs designation was conducted in close coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center, and the Government of Colombia.

Since June 2000, more than 1,900 entities and individuals have been named pursuant to the Kingpin Act for their role in international narcotics trafficking. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.",1

Leaked data contained scanned and electronic documents from the 1970s, when Mossack Fonseca started, and up to early 2015.

During their investigation, journalists had to use special software to index and analyze the data. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software was used to transform scan documents to electronic versions so they could be indexed and categorized for easier searching and analysis.

After a monumental work, yesterday, on April 3, 2016, ICIJ, together with SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, revealed their first analysis of the leaked documents, which only included data from 149 files of the total of 11.5 million.

From the currently leaked documents, it appears that some of the world's richest persons, some of whom were politicians and even head of states, used Mossack Fonseca to set up shell corporations in various tax havens around the globe and avoid paying taxes back home.

The data breach has its own name: Panama Papers

The leak, which is now known as the Panama Papers, has its own website where ICIJ says its journalists will start publishing new documents from now on, just as Edward Snowden uses The Intercept website and Julian Assange uses WikiLeaks.

Last Friday, probably after being contacted by members of the press for a request for comment, Mossack Fonseca sent an email to its clients acknowledging the breach of an email server.

Edward Snowden described Panama Papers on Twitter as the ""biggest leak in the history of data journalism.""

A who's who of world politics

Incriminated politicians and world figures include President of Argentina Mauricio Macri, former Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina Ivanishvili, Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur DavÃ­Ã° Gunnlaugsson, UAE President & Abu Dhabi emir Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, King of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, Ex-Prime Minister of Iraq Ayad Allawi, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, convicted former Ukraine Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, former President of Sudan Ahmad Ali al-Mirghani, and several others.

Additionally, there is the daughter of former Chinese Premier Li Xiaolin, Azerbaijan's first family, several FIFA officials, soccer star Lionel Messi, several musicians, childhood friends of Russian President Putin, cousins of Syrian President Bashar Assad, father of current British prime minister, and many other more. Honestly, the list could go on for at least a few more paragraphs.

Besides these high-profile names, the leaked documents also contain documents such as email chains, invoices, and money transfers for offshore companies that facilitated bribery, arms deals, tax evasion, financial fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and all sorts of other crimes.

Panama Papers is the biggest data leak ever

The Panama Papers incident is technically the world's biggest data leak, dwarfing WikiLeaks, which was only 0.06% of its size.

ICIJ investigators say the data leak included 4.8 million emails, 3 million database files, 2,15 million PDF files, 1.1 million photos, and 0.32 million text files.

Both SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ are running separate sites for the Panama Papers leak, which you should definitely follow from now on.

671,"The issue of economic crime recently made the front pages of the UKâs newspapers, when an investigation carried out by investigative journalists shone a light on the role of certain global banks in money laundering.

This has helped re-emphasise the important fight that government and society has against economic crime generally, and money laundering particularly as the government looks to develop its response to how it deals with economic crime.

In July last year, the UK government unveiled its Economic Crime Plan (ECP) 2019 to 2022, which set out the action being taken by the public and private sectors to ensure the UK has a world leading response to this challenge.

The ECP sets the agenda for economic crime reform in the short-to-medium term and is billed as a 'step-change' response, utilising the experience, capabilities and resources of the public and private sectors.

To help fund a number of the initiatives in the ECP, the government announced an economic crime levy on the anti-money laundering (AML) regulated sectors. The government hopes to introduce the levy by 2022/2023 and is looking to raise Â£100 million a year to help tackle money laundering.

A consultation was launched in July and sought views on how it could operate in practice, its design principles and to ensure it is effective and proportionate.

Whist the legal profession has an important role to play in the AML regime and we support the government focus on ensuring the UK has a world leading AML regime, we strongly oppose the levy.

Tackling money laundering benefits society as a whole, but rather than placing an additional tax on those already funding the fight against AML, additional funding should come from the public purse and other sources such as the assets recovered from criminals and AML fines on the regulated sector.

In the event that the government decides to move forward with its plans, we have argued strongly against calculating the levy on the basis of revenue because that has no bearing on the risks a firmâs work poses. Instead, we have argued strongly for a model based on the number of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) a firm submitted the previous year which would be simpler, cheaper to operate and fairer than a revenue-based levy.

We have also argued strongly for an exemption for small firms with revenue of less than Â£10.2 million a year which would see thousands of small firms being exempt from paying the levy. High streets firms are already facing unprecedented the challenges due to Covid-19 and having to pay another levy on top would be completely inappropriate.

The consultation has now closed, and we expect the government to announce the outcomes early next year. In the meantime, we continue to ensure the legal professions views on the issue are well presented with government officials, ministers and wider stakeholders.",0
430,"Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely.

Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. ""You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,"" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing ""privacy issues."" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: ""As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that."" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? ""Between the election and the nomination.""

So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process.

Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. ""Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate."" They declined to provide further answers on the record.

But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--""I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt""--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades.

""Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,"" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: ""He's lied to a lot of people.""

Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes:

TWENTY-SIX YEARS before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone.

Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, ""It's too early for Christmas."" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. ""I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,"" Trump said at the time.

The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. ""He was very, very sharp,"" says someone who worked with him back then. ""Very tough."" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that.

Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. ""People knew of him,"" says another former colleague, ""but not on his own."" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: ""He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.""

Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities.

Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003.

Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock.

Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million.

A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time.

""I just spoke to Ross,"" the reporter wrote. ""He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.""

""I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,"" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . ""And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' ""

Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. ""Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,"" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth.

WITHIN DAYS OF that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. ""She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,"" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. ""It was a perfect merger."" Adds another contemporary: ""She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.""

Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist René Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million.

His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds.

With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion.

That wasn't enough. ""I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,"" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. ""2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,"" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: ""3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.""

Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? ""You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,"" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. ""Really, for us, it was a bet on him, "" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. ""I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past."" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets.

IN 2010, ROSS set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call.

There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story.

In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million.

The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: ""Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.""

ON NOVEMBER 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross.

But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. ""I'd rather hang myself,"" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. ""I don't know why Wilbur took it.""

But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance.

Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion.

His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. ""It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,"" one ex-employee said. ""I was surprised that he would take that risk.""

But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations?

""I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,"" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . ""Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.""

After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. ""It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.""

The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. ""Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.""

The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross.

281,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, arraigned Nanle Miracle Dariye, son of former Plateau State Governor, Joshua Dariye, on a 6-count charge of money laundering to the tune of N1.5billion before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja.

Dariye was arraigned alongside Apartment le Paradis, an hotel where he was a director.

The defendant sometime in 2013 failed to report a cash transaction to the tune of N1.5billion which he received through the hotelâs account in one of the old generation banks. The amount is above the threshold of the N10million permissible by law. Additionally, the hotel was also not registered as Designated Non-Financial Institution, DNFI.

The offence is in contravention of Section 5(1) (a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 5 (b) of the same Act.

Count two of the charge reads:

âThat you, Nanle Miracle Dariye, while being a Director of Apartment le Paradis Limited and Apartment le Paradis Limited on 28 th day of March 2013 in Abuja within the Jurisdiction of this Honorable Court did commit an offence to wit: Failure to report within 7 (seven) days, a cash transaction in the sum of N551,555,428.50 (Five Hundred and Fifty One Million, Five Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Eight Naira, Fifty Kobo) paid to Apartment le Paradis Limited BY BGL Securities Ltd vide your First Bank Plc Account No 2014165731 on 28 th day of March 2013 which is above the threshold of N10,000,000 (Ten million Naira) and you hereby committed an offence contrary to Section 10(1) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 10 (3) of the same Act"".

The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge when they were read to him.

In view of his plea, counsel to the EFCC, George Adebola, asked the court to fix a date for trial and for the defendant to be remanded in prison custody.

However, Dariyeâs counsel, Charles Abalaka, pleaded that he was yet to file application for bail as he was served with the charge late yesterday. He urged the court to admit his client to bail, while presenting two sureties - Mr. Amana Yusuf, a Grade Level 12 civil servant working with Ministry of Defence and Mrs. Rose, a Grade Level 13 officer working in the Office of the Head of Service in Abuja.

Justice Ojukwu admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N5million with two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be resident of Abuja and must provide tax evidences for 2015, 2016 and 2017.

The judge, thereafter, adjourned to April 10 -12, 2018 for commencement of trial.

âThe defendant is to be remanded in EFCC custody pending the fulfillment of the bail conditionsâ, the judge added.",1

534,"The Supreme Court Friday agreed to hear an appeal challenging a Delhi HC order in 2015 which acquitted the Hinduja brothers in the Bofors scam case. (File)

The CBI on Friday filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging a 2005 order of the Delhi High Court quashing all charges against accused persons in the politically sensitive Bofors pay-off case. The filing of the appeal assumes significance as Attorney General K K Venugopal had recently advised the agency against moving a petition against the high court verdict after a delay of 12 years.

What is the Bofors scam?

On March 18, 1986, India signed a Rs 1,437-crore deal with Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors for the supply of 400 155 mm Howitzer guns for the Army. A year later, on April 16, 1987, a Swedish radio channel alleged that the company had bribed top Indian politicians and defence personnel to secure the contract. The scandal rocked the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in the late 1980s. On January 22, 1990, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lodged an FIR against the then president of Bofors Martin Ardbo, the alleged middleman Win Chadda and the Hinduja brothers for criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.

It was alleged that certain public servants and private persons in India and abroad had entered into a criminal conspiracy between 1982 and 1987 in pursuance of which the offences of bribery, corruption, cheating and forgery were committed.

The first charge sheet in the case was filed on October 22, 1999, against Chadda, Ottavio Quattrocchi, the then defence secretary S K Bhatnagar, Ardbo and the Bofors company. A supplementary charge sheet was filed against the Hinduja brothers on October 9, 2000.

Quattrocchi, who had fled from here on July 29-30, 1993, never appeared before any court in India to face prosecution. He passed away on July 13, 2013.

972,"Juan Zarate, a former Treasury official and now adviser to Coinbase, writes in his book Treasurys War that financial warfarehas started to form a central part of international security strategies. By understanding the financial networks underpinning drug cartels, terrorist organizations and rogue nations, U.S. law enforcement and the Treasury Department have been able to pursue more sophisticated strategies aimed at disrupting them.

As a result of the widespread adoption of this approach, both in the U.S. and abroad, financial institutions around the world are held to higher standards than ever before with regard to detecting, reporting and mitigating financial crime. This is viewed by many businesses as a burdensome and costly task. Complaints about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls in particular are common. Fintech companies, however, ought to recognize an opportunity to seize a competitive advantage.

Banks are generally weak with regard to financial crimes compliance, including AML/KYC controls and related operations such as information security and fraud prevention. The Department of Justice, for example, recently stated that the controls at HSBC were so bad that revealing them could potentially cause  serious criminal activity. Some went so far as to question whether HSBC is so large and complex that it is inherently impossible to govern.

In an unrelated piece about the ongoing sanctions compliance issues at Standard Chartered, the Financial Times highlighted two major causes of the banks headaches: a culture of disdain for American banking regulations and poor technology. Cultural and technological failures are industry-wide characteristics in banking, and they present a ripe target for fintech to gain an advantage.

Financial crime prevention can broadly be said to consist of three parts: reporting, intelligence and enforcement. Enforcement is, and always will fall under, the purview of governmental agencies and thus should only interest businesses tangentially. Intelligence and reporting, however, are naturally interrelated functions and give rise to business concerns due to regulatory requirements. Without a sound idea of what activity merits reporting, many institutions blindly generate tens of thousands of reports annually, several of which are very low-quality and of little use to law enforcement.

A recent discussion of flaws in the United Kingdoms AML laws pointed out that in that country, more than 350,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were filed in a year, resulting in law enforcement agencies being overwhelmed. This shotgun approach significantly reduces the value of reports in terms of mitigating risk to the institution, and often requires the mass hiring of expensive and often ineffective workers.

There are several reasons to think that fintech as an industry can and should do better. To begin with, regulators are beginning to pay more attention to their products and practices. John A. Cassara, a former Treasury Special Agent, recently wrote an excellent piece praising measures by the small African nation of Lesotho to regulate mobile payments and calling for the same in Western countries.

Innovative products in the financial space will ultimately run into regulators, and fintech companies need to be prepared for it. As Matt Levine wrote, Tech is an industry of moving fast and breaking things. Finance is an industry of moving fast, breaking things, being mired in years of litigation, paying 10-digit fines, and ruefully promising to move slower and break fewer things in the future.

But preparation aside, there are even greater advantages to be had by winning in this area. Fintech firms are technologically equipped to understand the activity occurring through their products in a way that banks simply are not, and thus they are better positioned to provide law enforcement with useful intelligence as opposed to scattershot reporting.

Aside from the usual advantages of pleasing regulators, behaving this way will squeeze traditional financial institutions on two fronts. First, it will drive standards in the industry, forcing them to invest more dumb money in areas where they are already grossly inefficient. Second, it will leave fintech businesses less exposed to the record-setting fines that are hamstringing banks. Driving these two costs will further decrease margins in vulnerable aspects of banks businesses. This will ultimately provide an opportunity for fintech firms to obtain another competitive advantage over traditional financial firms.",0
368,"May 28, 2013 -- Internet bank Liberty Reserve is being charged with laundering $6 billion in suspected crime proceeds, including the illegal profits from credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking.

Prosecutors say it ""may be the largest international money laundering case ever brought by the United States.""

Liberty Reserve was a ""black market bank,"" created and structured to ""facilitate criminal activity,"" according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Bharara and top officials from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network unsealed an indictment against Liberty Reserve and seven of its principals today, charging them with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Liberty Reserve is estimated to have had more than 1 million users worldwide, including more than 200,000 users in the United States.

All told, the government charges, Liberty Reserve processed 55 million separate financial transactions and laundered $6 billion in criminal proceeds. According to the indictment, Liberty Reserve operated a digital currency system designed to provide criminals with a way to launder their profits without leaving a trace.

""As alleged, Liberty Reserve deliberately operated in a way to attract and aid criminals who wished to use digital currency to break the law and to launder the proceeds of their crimes,"" Bharara said. ""We have indicted Liberty Reserve itself because, as alleged, its entire existence was based on a criminal business model.""

In addition to indicting the company and its principals, the government is restraining more than $25 million in alleged criminal proceeds from the company, forfeiting its domain names, and seizing its servers around the world.

The investigation and takedown involved law enforcement action in 17 countries, including Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Spain, Morocco, Sweden, Switzerland, Cyprus, Australia, China, Norway, Latvia, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada and the U.S.

The government charges that Liberty Reserve was so intent on attracting criminal customers, it didn't even bother to ask its clients for basic identifying information, or to validate their identities, all in the interest of keeping transactions untraceable.

Users routinely established accounts under false names, including such blatantly criminal names as ""Russia Hackers"" and ""Hacker Account,"" according to the indictment.

As part of the investigation, the indictment says, a law enforcement agent opened and executed transactions through an undercover account at Liberty Reserve in the name of ""Joe Bogus"" and the address ""123 Fake Main Street"" in ""Completely Made Up City, New York.""

The government also charges that Liberty Reserve, based in Costa Rica, tried a number of dodges to stay in business, even after the governments of the U.S. and Costa Rica tried to shut them down.

The defendants were allegedly caught lying to anti-money laundering authorities in Costa Rica and pretending to shut down Liberty Reserve after learning the company was being investigated by U.S. law enforcement. They then allegedly continued operating the business through a set of shell companies, and moved tens of millions of dollars through shell company accounts maintained in Cyprus, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Morocco, Spain, Australia and elsewhere.

Liberty Reserve today was also named a ""financial institution of primary money laundering concern"" under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This Treasury Department action includes a notice to the Federal Register proposing to prohibit U.S. banks and financial institutions from opening or maintaining accounts for foreign banks that are being used to process transactions involving Liberty Reserve.

Five defendants were arrested on May 24, 2013, including Arthur Budovsky, the principal founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Spain; Vladmir Kats, the co-founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Brooklyn, N.Y.; Azzeddine El Amine, a manager of Liberty Reserve's financial accounts, who was arrested in Spain; and Mark Marmilev and Maxim Chukharev, who helped design and maintain Liberty Reserve's technological infrastructure, who were arrested in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, respectively.

Two other defendants, Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani (Yassine) and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez (Hidalgo), are at large in Costa Rica.

ABC News' efforts to reach a representative of Liberty Reserve were unsuccessful.

""The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking."" Bharara said. ""As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.""",1

397,"US President Donald Trump is currently on trial in the Senate, having been impeached by the House over Democrat allegations that withholding military aid to Ukraine over corruption concerns amounted to an abuse of power. Former Ukrainian officials and anti-corruption activists, however, have testified that not only was there corruption involving Burisma, the natural gas firm tied to former vice president and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Bidens son, but that it went all the way to the top.

These revelations can be found in the third installment of the documentary series UkraineGate: Inconvenient facts, produced by the French investigative journalist Olivier Berruyer, founder of popular anti-corruption and economics blog Les Crises.

Hunter Biden was hired solely to pressure Ukrainian authorities into stopping the criminal investigations into Burisma, former Deputy Prosecutor-General Renat Kuzmin told Berruyer. These investigations had raised the possibility that Bidens compensation was in effect a bribe being channeled to his father, who handled the Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

When VP Biden demanded the firing of head prosecutor Viktor Shokin  as he later boasted on camera  Poroshenko was happy to oblige, even if he had to bribe some members of the Rada to make it happen, interviewees have revealed.

A leading anti-corruption activist openly accused the former president of keeping the office of prosecutor-general under personal political control. One former deputy prosecutor said that Poroshenko treated the office as an escort service, in his pursuit of money and power.

A former employee of the prosecutor-generals office described Poroshenko as the most corrupt president in our history, as of now.

Former MP Oleksandr Onyschenko testified that Burismas owner Mykola Zlochevsky used him in late 2015 to relay a $50 million bribe offer to Poroshenko to make the investigations go away  and that the president agreed. The former parliamentarian and close associate of Poroshenko has since turned whistleblower, admitting to taking bribes himself in exchange for votes, such as the one to remove Shokin.

Poroshenko lost his re-election bid in 2019 to comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, and is currently reported to be facing multiple criminal investigations for corruption.

Unfortunately, Ukraine is corrupt to the core, said former Deputy Prosecutor Kuzmin, pointing the finger of blame at the US governments involvement with Poroshenkos administration.",1
504,"Federal prosecutors in New York urged a judge Wednesday to send a Turkish banker to prison for more than 15 years when he is sentenced later this month for causing immense risks to the national security of the United States.

Mehmet Atilla was convicted in January of conspiring to launder a billion dollars in Iranian oil revenue in violation of US sanctions.

At a time when the United States and the community of nations were engaged in the momentous undertaking of depriving the Government of Iran of funding for its malign and deadly activitiesincluding its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of delivering those weapons throughout the region and around the world; and its financial, logistical, and military support for terrorist organizations and acts of terrorismAtilla was a key player in massively undermining those efforts, prosecutors wrote in their sentencing submission.

Defense attorneys said a harsh sentence would be unfair and urged the judge to be lenient.

Unlike prosecutions involving massive frauds and staggering victim losses, here there are no victims who suffered a financial loss, defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing submission.

The defense also portrayed Atillah as a functionary in a conspiracy led by Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who pleaded guilty on the eve of trial and agreed to cooperate with the government.

Whatever Atillas role prosecutors said his offenses are in some respects without parallel and the immense risks that he and his co-conspirators created to the national security of the United States and to the safety and stability of the entire globe are similarly without ready comparison.

The case strained US-Turkey relations after testimony that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan signed off on parts of the scheme. Erdogan denied it and accused the U.S. of engaging in a plot against his country based on information from followers of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric based in Pennsylvania who Erdogan has blamed for a failed coup attempt.

Atilla is scheduled to be sentenced April 11.",1
739,"After years of tiptoeing around the issue, EU governments are finally set to check on each otherâs records on the rule of law. This is a significant step forward, but governments have to take this broad dialogue seriously and talks must lead to action, argues Linda Ravo.

Linda Ravo is an expert adviser at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties).

As it reaches the end of its six-month Council Presidency term, Germany has invited all EU governments to sit around the table on 10 November and start a discussion on the rule of law and democracy in every EU country. Discussions will be based on the recently launched annual audit of EU countriesâ rule of law situation by the European Commission.

To avoid this becoming a dialogue for the deaf, the Germans must prepare well and set some clear rules. And the EU still needs to create and use other tools to the full.

A welcome, long over-due step

The fact that this is happening at all is a significant step forward. In the ârule of law dialogueâ that ran for the past six years, governments were just invited (not obliged) to present on a particular aspect of the rule of law in their country. There were no questions, no reviews of a countryâs performance and no recommendations.

In the background, the situation alarmingly deteriorated in Hungary, Poland and a number of other EU countries. It will come as no surprise that the elephants in the room strenuously tried to block any improvements to the old system.

Getting it right

Getting the peer review right could pre-empt, or at least weaken, such attempts. Here are three golden rules.

First, there should be a first discussion involving national independent actors, and regional and international monitoring bodies, before the official dialogue starts. If member states have all the relevant information beforehand, that will help governments backing up the exercise not to fall for the examineesâ deflections and the authoritariansâ provocations.

This will also serve to steal a march on dodgy initiatives to come up with alternative country assessments.

Second, governments should take the dialogue seriously as an opportunity to question their peers on their performance and make tangible recommendations for improvements. We have seen how emulation can gang up authoritarian plans â just think of Slovenian Prime Minister Janez JanÅ¡aâs war against the media, patterning after Hungary and Polandâs.

But peer pressure can be for the best, too.

Third, recommendations should be made public. Governments should have to report back on them and progress should be verified against information from civil society groups and independent monitoring bodies, like the Council of Europe.

A tough row to hoe

Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark and Estonia are first up in the discussion. One can expect Hungary, Poland and its faithful peers to jump on opportunity to attack Belgium and Denmark â two proponents of better protection for the rule of law â and to pick an argument on the others to deepen the blocâs division.

Bulgaria will prove to be an especially difficult discussion. The picture painted of the country in the Commissionâs report is grim. It exposes attacks on the judiciary, an ineffective anti-corruption framework, lack of media pluralism and threats to watchdogs such as journalists and rights groups, coupled with a generally low trust of people in public institutions.

If this is not serious enough, the Commissionâs assessment fails to mention other problematic developments affecting the justice system, as also reported by Liberties. Neither does it dig into how the countryâs oligarchic mafia has been infiltrating the government, which is at the origin of the countryâs pervasive corruption (and misuse of EU taxpayersâ money).

And yet, the Commission considered Bulgaria to have made âsufficientâ progress just a year ago when it looked at what had been accomplished since accession to the EU. This makes the peer review on Bulgaria a real battleground for countries like Hungary who try to undermine the credibility and impartiality of the whole exercise.

Actions speak louder than words

Even if this system of peer review is made as strong as possible, by itself it wonât be enough to preserve European democracies from the kinds of sustained attacks carried out by the EUâs authoritarian governments.

There is no excuse for the Council to continue dragging its feet on imposing sanctions under Article 7 on Hungary and Poland. Governments supportive of democracy also need to stand their ground and push for the adoption of a strong mechanism that will link access to EU funds to respect for the rule of law, instead of getting away with lousy deals.

Rights and democracy groups in problematic countries must get real support under the future Justice, Rights and Values fund. And the Commission needs to pursue court cases promptly and with less reticence than hitherto.",0
67,"The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

The notice from the NAB stated that former federal minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi, former secretary Ismail Qureshi, additional secretary Yousaf Memon and ex-secretary of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), Dr Naseem A Khan, have also been nominated in the case, as reported by Geo News.

The reference was filed in connection with the alleged illegal appointment of Basharat Hasan Bashir as a consultant for one of the country's top alternative energy board on a Management Position-II (MP-II) scale salary package.

According to the Express Tribune, the ex-joint secretary of water and power, Ghulam Nabi Mangrio, ex-section officer of water and power, Umar Farooq and retired air marshal and former chairman of AEDB, Shahid Hamid, are also among the accused in the NAB reference.

Allegedly, Bashir was appointed as the consultant in 2006 without following prerequisite procedures. His appointment also violated MP scale policy guidelines.

""After the expiry of his consultancy contract in May 2008, the accused Basharat Hasan Bashir illegally held the said post for almost 5 years without any extension, notification or regular appointment and kept on enjoying salary and all perks and privileges illegally in connivance with the management of AEDB,"" the NAB stated in the reference.

716,"A little less than two years after raising its seed round, the Israeli-based Nym Health has added another $16.5 million to its cash haul so it can roll out its technology developing auditable machine learning tools for automating hospital billing.

The new financing came from investors, including GV (the investment arm of Google previously known as Google Ventures), and will be used by the company to expand its technology development and sales and marketing efforts across the U.S.

Billing has been a huge problem for healthcare systems in the U.S., thanks to complicated coding that needs to be entered to ensure insurance providers pay for the services medical professionals give to patients.

Nym claims to have solved the problem by developing technologies that can convert medical charts and electronic medical records from physicianâs consultations into proper billing codes automatically. The company uses natural language processing and taxonomies that were specifically developed to understand clinical language to determine the optimal charge for each procedure, examination and diagnostic conducted for a patient, according to Nym.

The company was founded in 2018 by two former members of Israelâs 8200 cybersecurity unit of the army. Adam Rimon and Amihai Neiderman both wanted to work on something together and Neiderman was set on doing something in the medical space involving natural language processing. Rimon had just finished a doctorate in computational linguistics, so the move into charting and medical coding seemed natural.

âBecause of our approach we can generate full audit trails,â said Neiderman. âWe can explain how we understood everything in patient charts.â

Having automated processes that are also auditable is important for healthcare providers in case they need to provide justification to insurance companies for the services they performed.

Nymâs software canât address fraud if physicians are padding their bills with services they didnât offer, but it can provide an audit and justification for the services that a hospital coded for â and potentially wring more money for hospitals that lose out thanks to improperly coded bills. âOn the medical decision-making we never intervene. We assume that the physician is trying to do their best and theyâre sticking to the protocol,â said Neiderman.

Interest in developing better billing systems for healthcare is high among venture investors, considering that coding related denials of payment can cost hospitals $15 billion, according to Nym. Itâs a service that brought attention not just from GV, but Bessemer Venture Partners, Dynamic Loop Capital, Lightspeed, Tiger Global, and angel investors including Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner from Flatiron Health.

âInaccurate coding is bad for everybody,â says Ben Robbins, a venture partner at GV.

Nym charges between $1 and $4 per chart it analyzes, and is already working with around 40 medical providers in the U.S., according to the company.",0

WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today removed Patricia Rosa Vinck, Barakaat International, and Barakaat International Foundation from its Specially Designated Nationals List, having found that Vinck and the two entities no longer present a significant threat of supporting terrorism. Today's action was taken in conjunction with a removal of the three names from the United Nations' 1267 Sanctions Committee (U.N. 1267 Committee) Consolidated List of individuals and entities subject to U.N. sanctions measures.

""The U.S. Government is actively supporting the comprehensive review underway at the U.N. 1267 Committee to ensure the efficacy, accuracy, and fairness of this vital sanctions regime,"" said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. ""We are reviewing the evidentiary records for hundreds of listings  advocating for continued preventative sanctions against those who pose a significant threat of supporting terrorism and removal of those who do not.""

Vinck, Barakaat International, and Barakaat International Foundation were all designated by the Treasury Department under Executive Order 13224 and by the U.N. 1267 Committee. The Treasury Department and the United Nations designated Vinck in January 2003 and the two Barakaat entities in November 2001.

Vinck is the wife of Nabil Abdul Salam Sayadi, who headed the Belgium office of the Global Relief Foundation (GRF), an organization designated in October 2002 by the United States and the United Nations for its support to al Qaida. Vinck served as the secretary of GRF's Belgium office and facilitated GRF's activities. Following U.S. and U.N. sanctions against her, Vinck ceased her activities on behalf of GRF.

The Barakaat organizations were part of a financial conglomerate operating in 40 countries around the world that facilitated the financing and operations of al Qaida and other terrorist organizations. The U.S. and U.N. sanctions against these entities assisted the global effort to prevent them from routing funds to al Qaida and other terrorist groups, and the two organizations are no longer operating. Other designated entities and individuals related to the Barakaat conglomerate remain on the U.S. and U.N. sanctions lists.

The U.N. 1267 Committee is currently implementing a number of procedural and other measures called for by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1822, adopted in June 2008, to improve the effectiveness and fairness of U.N. sanctions. These measures include a comprehensive review of the approximately 500 names on the U.N. 1267 Committee's Consolidated List to be completed by June 2010. The resolution also mandates the establishment and posting on the U.N. 1267 Committee's website of narrative summaries of reasons for the listing of all individuals and entities on the Consolidated List, and updates to the U.N. 1267 Committee's listing and delisting procedures. The United States strongly supports and is participating vigorously in these efforts.

More information about the activities of the U.N. 1267 Committee, including the Consolidated List and corresponding narrative summaries, can be found on the U.N. 1267 Committee's website at www.un.org/sc/committees/1267.

493,"(CBS/AP) AUSTIN, Texas - A lawyer for Jose Tevino Morales, the brother of two Mexican cartel leaders convicted of running a money laundering operation from a horse ranch in Oklahoma, described Morales as ""humble, honest, trustworthy, [and] caring,"" but a federal judge in Texas still sentenced him to 20 years in prison Thursday, the Austin American-Statesman reports.

Morales was sentenced for investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest. His brothers, Miguel Angel and Oscar Omar Trevino Morales, are believed to lead the Zetas cartel, which has expanded beyond the drug trade to become the biggest criminal group in Mexico.

On Thursday, Trevino's lawyer told the court that the state was treating him unfairly because of who his brothers are. But U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks told Trevino, ""No one in this court has alleged you are a Zeta. You are charged with moving money for the Zetas,"" the paper reports.

Mexican authorities arrested Miguel Angel Trevino Morales in July. A New York indictment against him estimates he received $10 million per month in income from cocaine sales alone, not to mention the money brought in by the cartel's myriad illicit activities, including kidnapping, extortion, migrant trafficking, weapons trafficking, even theft of oil from state pipelines.

During the trial earlier this year, prosecutors said the money laundering operation in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico created fake companies and in some cases fixed races. Horse owners, trainers and others crafted bank deposits to mask the drug money being used to fund the operation.

Jose Trevino Morales was among 18 people indicted last year in a federal investigation that charged him with running the horse operation from a sprawling ranch near Lexington, Okla., on behalf of his brothers. Neighbors said those who worked with the ranch spent lots of cash, bought land and made improvements at a time when others in the industry were struggling financially.

More than 400 of the horses involved were seized and auctioned, and proceeds from the sales have netted the government $9 million, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks also was expected to sentence Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, Fernando Solis Garcia, Eusevio Maldonado and Raul Ramirez, who pleaded guilty in April to a lesser money laundering charge. Trevino's wife and daughter have pleaded guilty to lesser charges but have not been sentenced.

The trial was held in Austin because federal authorities in Central Texas prosecuted the case.",1

(Pashto: ?????? ????????; Persian: ?????? ????????; born 1 August 1949) [2] is an Afghan politician and former Mujahideen Leader. He is the founder and current leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party (so-called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezbi Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis). [3] [4] He has twice served as Prime Minister of Afghanistan during the 1990s.

Hekmaytar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s in the era after Ayub Khan, where he was known for his Islamic renaissance thoughts rejected by a traditionalist Islamic faction of the organization. He spent time in Pakistan as he was searched by Daoud Regime, before returning to Afghanistan when the SovietAfghan War began in 1979, at which time he and his Hezb-e Islami organization quickly started resistance to Soviet Invasion. [5] Seeing his advances in resistance movement, the US and Saudis shifted their funding to Hizb-e Islami in mid 1980s. Due to his success on the war field and large resistance area held, he received more International funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War. [6]

Following the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar was at first inclined to become part of the Interim government. But due to the involvement of many international powers (US, UK, and France in particular) in intra-Afghan dialogues and strong disagreements between different Mujahideen groups over many Government Posts and power-sharing in the interim Government, Hekmatyar stepped down from the interim Government as to him, International agencies (allegedly the CIA, MI6 and ISI) were preparing an unfair plan for power-sharing in the Government. And, that the dialogues were delay tactics to allow Massoud and his allies to advance to Kabul and seize the city. [5] Hekmatyar then got engaged in Afghan civil war in hope of capturing Kabul before Massoud. The civil war lead to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused in west of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city, although Shia Militias, Doustum and Massoud's forces were already in fierce battle for the control of city, before Hekmatyar had jumped into war. [7] In the meantime, as a part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996, before the Taliban takeover of Kabul forced him to leave Afghanistan to Iran 's capital Tehran. [8]

After the Taliban's fall in 2001 he went to Pakistan and later Afghanistan, to reorganize his paramilitary forces and start resistance movement against the Karzai Government and the invading ISAF (International coalition) forces. [9] In 2016, he signed a peace deal with the Government of Ashraf Ghani and returned to Afghanistan after almost 20 years in exile and resistance. [10]

Early life[ edit ]

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1949 in Imam Saheb, Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. [11] [4] His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the Ghazni province. [12] Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his Islamic political views two years later. [12] [13] From 1969 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University 's engineering department. During his first year at the university he wrote a 149-page book entitled The Priority of Sense Over Matter, where he refutes communists denying the existence of God by quoting European philosophers and scientists like Hegel or Francesco Redi. [14] Though he did not complete his degree, his followers still address him as ""Engineer Hekmatyar"". [12] [13] [15]

During his years in university, Hekmatyar joined the Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman (""Organization of Muslim Youth"") [12] which was gaining influence because of its opposition to the Soviet influence in Afghanistan increasing through the PDPA elements in Daoud's government. He was one of the foundational members of the organization. [16] [17] He may have also been influenced by the ideological teachings of Muslim Brotherhood member Sayyid Qutb. [18] By his own account he became an Islamist when he heard of Qutb's death in 1966, on radio, and also contradicts the fact that he ever was a communist during his youth. [19] Although some make a claim that Hekmatyar threw acid at multiple female students, but this claim is largely attributed to as Soviet KGB 's black propaganda even by his strong rivals. [20]

Hekmatyar's Islamic Revolutionary mindset put him in confrontation with elements in the Muslim Youth surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud, also an engineering student at Kabul University. In 1975, the ""Islamic Society"" split between supporters of Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-e Islami, and elements surrounding Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who then founded the Hezb-i Islami. Akbarzadeh and Yasmeen describe Hekmatyar's approach as ""radical"" and antagonistic as opposed to an ""inclusive"" and ""moderate"" strategy by Rabbani. [21] While others describe Massoud in Rabbani's side as having ethnic germs rather than having an Islamic inclusive approach.

The arrival of Afghan opposition militants in Peshawar coincided with a period of diplomatic tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan, due to Daoud's revival of the Pashtunistan issue. [ citation needed ] Under the secret policy of the United States and Britain, and the patronage of Pakistani General Naseerullah Babar, then governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and with the blessing of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, camps were set up to train Hekmatyar and other anti-Daoud Islamists. [22] The Islamist movement had two main tendencies: the Jamiat-e islami (""Islamic society"") led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, that advocated a gradualist strategy to gain power, through infiltration of society and the state apparatus. Rabbani advocated for the ""building of a widely based movement that would create popular support"". [23] The other movement, called Hezb-i Islami (""Islamic Party""), was led by Hekmatyar, who favored a radical approach in the form of violent armed conflict. Pakistani support largely went to Hekmatyar's group, who, in October 1975, undertook to instigate an uprising against the government. Without popular support, the rebellion ended in complete failure, and hundreds of militants were arrested. [24]

Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami was formed as an elitist avant-garde based on a strictly disciplined Islamist ideology within a homogeneous organization that Olivier Roy described as "" Leninist"", and employed the rhetoric of the Iranian Revolution. [25] It had its operational base in the Nasir Bagh, Worsak and Shamshatoo refugee camps in Pakistan. In these camps, Hezb-i Islami formed a social and political network and operated everything from schools to prisons, with the support of the Pakistani government and their Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). [26] [27] From 19761977 Afghan President Daoud made overtures to Pakistan which led to reconciliation with Pakistani leader Bhutto. [23] Bhutto's support to Hekmatyar, however, continued and when Bhutto was removed from power in Pakistan by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, Zia continued supporting Hekmatyar. [28]

Soviet war in Afghanistan[ edit ]

Hekmatyar and his Hizb-e Islami along with Jamiat e Islami, Harkat-einqalab Islami etc fought by their own limited sources and some assistance from Pakistan from 1978 till 1983-1984. It was then in 1984 when the international community particularly United States, England, France and Middle Eastern Arab Countries took interest in Soviet-Afghan War. With everyone having their own interests in the war, International community aided various Mujahideen groups with weapons, money and Media support.

In the later half of the SovietAfghan War, Hekmatyar received aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States. [29] [30] According to the ISI, their decision to allocate the highest percentage of covert aid to Hekmatyar was based on his record as an effective and most Popular anti-Soviet and Anti-communist military commander in Afghanistan. [31] Others describe his position as the result of having ""almost no grassroots support and no military base inside Afghanistan"", and thus being the much more ""dependent on Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq 's protection and financial largesse"" than other mujahideen factions. [32]

Warfare with other Afghan groups[ edit ]

Hekmatyar has been harshly criticized [ by whom? ] for his behavior during the Soviet war and the civil war, and was criticized for his group's ""xenophobic"" tendencies. [33] At various times, he both fought against and allied himself with almost every other group in Afghanistan. He ordered frequent attacks on other rival factions to weaken them in order to improve his position in the post-Soviet power vacuum. An example of his tendency for internecine rivalry was his arranging the arrest of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Pakistan in 1976 on spying charges. [34] Another example is when Massoud and Hekmatyar agreed to stage a takeover operation in the Panjshir valley Hekmatyar at the last minute refused to engage his part of the offensive, leaving Massoud open and vulnerable. Massoud's forces barely escaped with their lives. [35] In 1987, members of Hekmatyar's faction killed British cameraman Andy Skrzypkowiak, who was carrying footage of Massoud's successes to the West. Despite protests from British representatives, Hekmatyar did not punish the culprits, and instead rewarded them with gifts. [36] Another example of the Hezb-i Islami's tendency to internecine fighting was given on 9 July 1989, when Sayyed Jamal, one of Hekmatyar's commanders, ambushed and killed 30 commanders of Massoud's Shura-ye-Nazar at Farkhar in Takhar province. The attack was typical of Hekmatyar's strategy of trying to cripple rival factions, and incurred widespread condemnation among the mujahideen. [37]

Another possible instance of Hekmatyar's treachery [ peacock term ] toward his rivals occurred in 1987. The Paris-based group Médecins Sans Frontières reported that Hekmatyar's guerrillas hijacked a 96-horse caravan bringing aid into northern Afghanistan in 1987, stealing a year's supply of medicine and cash that was to be distributed to villagers. This would have allowed the villagers to buy food. French relief officials also asserted that Thierry Niquet, an aid coordinator bringing cash to Afghan villagers, was killed by one of Hekmatyar's commanders in 1986. It is thought that two American journalists traveling with Hekmatyar in 1987, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were killed not by the Soviets, as Hekmatyar's men claimed, but during a firefight initiated by Hekmatyar's forces against another mujahideen group. [38] In addition, there were frequent reports throughout the war of Hekmatyar's commanders negotiating and dealing with pro-Communist local militias in northern Afghanistan. [39]

Hekmatyar made an unlikely alliance with hardline communist and Minister of Defence Shahnawaz Tanai who launched a failed coup attempt in March 1990 against President Najibullah.

Hekmatyar has been accused of spending ""more time fighting other Mujahideen than killing Soviets."" [40] Hekmatyar remains a controversial figure [41] - the New York Times once described him as ""perhaps the most brutal of a generally brutal group"". [42]

Further information: Civil war in Afghanistan (199296)

A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the ""Butcher of Kabul"", accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s. [43]

According to the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan in 19891992, Peter Tomsen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hired in 1990 by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to conquer and rule Afghanistan in the benefit of Pakistani interests, which plan was delayed until 1992 due to US pressure to cancel that plan. [44]

In April 1992, as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan began to collapse, government officials joined the mujahideen, choosing different parties according to their ethnic and political affinities. For the most part, the members of the khalq faction of the PDPA, who were predominantly Pashtuns, joined with Hekmatyar. [45] With their help, he began on 24 April to infiltrate troops into Kabul, and announced that he had seized the city, and that should any other leaders try to fly into Kabul, he would shoot their plane down. [46] The new leader of the ""Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan"", Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, appointed Ahmad Shah Massoud as defense minister, and urged him to take action. This he did, taking the offensive on 25 April, and after two days heavy fighting, the Hezb-i Islami and its allies were expelled from Kabul. [47] A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi's plane. [3] The following day, fighting resumed between Burhanuddin Rabbani 's and Ahmed Shah Massoud's Jamiat, Abdul Rashid Dostum 's Jumbish forces and Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami forces.

From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands, most of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction, but Hekmatyar's group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas. [48] Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants' collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a New York Times journalist that Afghanistan ""already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic."" [49] His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population. [50] In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as Hizb-e-Wahdat, a Hazara Shi'a party, to form the Shura-i Hamahangi (""Council of coordination""). Together they laid Siege on Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum's troops from the capital. [51]

Further information: Civil war in Afghanistan (19962001)

The Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul, which would be friendly to their interests. By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun Taliban. [52] After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-i Islami positions. They captured Wardak on 2 February 1995, and moved on to Maidan Shahr on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed. [53] On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to Surobi. [54]

Nonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar's attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar's weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women's dress, that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital. [55] The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996. Many of the HIG local commanders joined the Taliban ""both out of ideological sympathy and for reason of tribal solidarity."" [56] Those that did not were expelled by the Taliban. In Pakistan Hezb-e-Islami training camps ""were taken over by the Taliban and handed over"" to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) groups such as the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). [57] Hekmatyar then fled to Massoud's stronghold in Panjshir who, despite Hekmatyar's history of animosity towards him, helped him flee to Iran in 1997 where he is said to have resided for almost six years. [58] Isolated from Afghanistan he is reported to have ""lost ... his power base back home"" to defections or inactivity of former members. He was also distrusted by the Iranian Government who found him too unpredictable, unreliable, and an unnecessary liability, considering its tense relations at the time with the Taliban and the Pakistani government, and despite his pleas, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards refused to establish a proxy through any of his organizations or assist him in any way. [59] Allegedly, they even cut his phone lines and turned away anyone who wished to see him in his villa in North Tehran. [60]

Post-9/11 activities[ edit ]

After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly ""worked closely"" with bin Laden in early 1990s, [61] declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N. -brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts. [4]

The United States accused Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He was also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai 's government. ISAF identified Hekmatyar in 2002 as the number one security threat, ahead of the Taliban or al-Qaeda. [62] He was also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai in Kandahar and a bomb the same day that killed more than a dozen people in Kabul. [63] [64] That same month, he released newsletters and tape messages calling for jihad against the United States. One of his commanders commented that there ""will be suicide attacks [...] against soldiers"". [65] On 25 December 2002 news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces. [ citation needed ]

On February 10, 2003 the Afghan government reported that Hekmatyar was planning an alliance with Taliban and al-Qaeda factions. His group was involved in an intense battle with the U.S. army near Spin Boldak. [66] On February 19, 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a ""global terrorist."" [ clarification needed ] [67] This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the U.S., or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners. [ citation needed ]

In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. [68] In an audiotape released the same month, he called for revolt against U.S. forces and Karzai's ""pupper government"", and directly threatened to kill Lt. General Karl Eikenberry. [69] In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted. [70] In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar claimed ""the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well."" In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed ""that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago."" BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, ""We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place."" [71]

2008 resurgence[ edit ]

In May 2008, the Jamestown Foundation reported that after being ""sidelined from Afghan politics"" since the mid-1990s, Gulbuddin's HIG group had ""recently reemerged as an aggressive militant group, claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces at the time, primarily the International Security Assistance Force and the administration of President Hamid Karzai."" The re-emergence of him as an ""experienced guerrilla strategist"" came at a propitious time for insurgency, following the killing of Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, when some elements of the Taliban were becoming ""disorganized and frustrated."" [4] HIG claimed responsibility for and is thought to have at least assisted in a 27 April 2008 attempt on the life of President Karzai in Kabul that killed three Afghan citizens, including a member of parliament. Other attacks it was thought to be responsible for include the 2 January 2008 shooting down in Laghman province of a helicopter containing foreign troops; the shooting and forcing down of a U.S. military helicopter in Sarubi district of Kabul on 22 January; and blowing up a Kabul police vehicle in March 2008, killing 10 soldiers. [4]

In interviews he demanded ""all foreign forces to leave immediately unconditionally."" Offers by President Hamid Karzai to open talks with ""opponents of the government"" and hints that they would be offered official posts ""such as deputy minister or head of department"", were thought to be directed at Hekmatyar. It was reported in 2008 that Hekmatyar lived in an unknown location in southeastern Afghanistan, close to the Pakistani border. [4] In 2008, he denied any links with the Taliban or al-Qaeda and was even considered for Prime Minister. [72] At the time, Hekmatyar was believed to shuttle between hideouts in Pakistan's mountainous tribal areas and northeast Afghanistan. [73]

In January 2010, he was still considered as one of the three main leaders of the Afghan insurgency. By then, he held out the possibility of negotiations with President Karzai and outlined a roadmap for political reconciliation. This contrasted with the views of Taliban leader Mullah Omar and allied insurgent chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who refused any talks with Kabul as long as foreign troops remain in the country, Hekmatyar appeared less reluctant. [74]

On 10 February 2014, Gulbuddin's HIG group executed an attack which killed two US civilians, Paul Goins and Michael Hughes, and wounded two other Americans and seven Afghan nationals. HIG was also responsible for a 16 May 2013 suicide VBIED attack in Kabul, which destroyed a US armored SUV and killed two US soldiers, four US civilian contractors, eight Afghansincluding two childrenand wounded at least 37 others. The attack marked the deadliest incident against US personnel in Kabul in 2013.

2016 peace deal and pardon[ edit ]

On 22 September 2016, Hekmatyar was pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal between Hezb-i-Islami and the government. The deal also allowed for the release of Hezb-i-Islami prisoners and the return of Hekmatyar to public life. The deal led a group of young activists to organise a protest against the pardoning less than a mile away from the signing ceremony. Human Rights Watch called the deal ""an affront to victims of grave abuses"". [75] Hezb-i-Islami agreed to cease hostilities, cut ties to extremist groups and respect the Afghan Constitution in exchange for government recognition of the group and support for the removal of United Nations and American sanctions against Hekmatyar, who was also promised an honorary post in the government. [76] [77]

The agreement was formalised on 29 September 2016 with both Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Hekmatyar, who appeared via a video link in the presidential palace, signing the agreement. [78] UN sanctions on him were formally lifted on 3 February 2017. [79] On 4 May 2017, he returned to Kabul along with his fighters to meet President Ghani after spending two decades in hiding. [80]

Some of Gulbuddin's relatives have served or are suspected of serving as his deputies.

59,"A reputed drug lord on the FBI's top 10 most-wanted list was captured in western Colombia, the interior minister said Monday, in a major blow to the country's largest remaining drug cartel.

Diego Montoya, who sits alongside Osama Bin Laden as the only major alleged drug trafficker on the FBI list, is accused of leading the Norte del Valle cartel and exporting tons of cocaine to the United States. The FBI had offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to his arrest.

The FBI says Montoya is sought ""in connection with the manufacture and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine."" It said the cartel is aided by left-wing rebels as well as right-wing paramilitaries.

Montoya's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, was captured by Colombia in January.

The Norte del Valle cartel became Colombia's most powerful after the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cartels in the 1980s and early 90s. Officials believe it is responsible for as much as 30 percent of the more than 550 tons of Colombian cocaine smuggled each year to the United States.

To protect its valuable drug routes, the cartel is believed to have worked closely with right-wing death squads whose umbrella organization, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, is listed as a terrorist organization by Washington.

Authorities have been closing in on the cartel since last year, when the army killed eight members of a private army believed to be protecting Diego Montoya.

A 2006 gunfight outside the Mi Casita psychiatric hospital left 11 Colombian police officers dead, and the police may have been acting on a tip that Montoya was hiding in the home, posing as a patient. There have been charges it was an ambush.

The Christian Science Monitor reports Montoya likes fast cars. Police in 2005 seized his personal mini racetrack last year, along with 74 ranches and eight houses. He is described as heavyset and gruff, and likes to be called ""El SeÃ±or de la Guerra (War).""

Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges. For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.

Most of those extradited have been low or midlevel drug traffickers. High-profile extraditions have included Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, brothers who helped found the Cali cartel.

Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States. Supply has remained robust despite record extraditions and eradication of coca crops.",1
57,"Malaysia has fined 80 individuals and entities, including politicians and businesses, for allegedly receiving money from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the countryâs anti-graft chief said on Monday.

The individuals include former Prime Minister Najib Razakâs brother, Nazir Razak, who was chairman of Malaysiaâs second-largest bank CIMB until his resignation at the end of 2018.

Former Malaysian trade minister Shahrir Abdul Samad, who was later the chairman of state palm oil agency Felda, and former deputy trade minister Ahmad Maslan were also issued compound notices.

Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysiaâs Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters on Monday that the agency was aiming to recover 420 million ringgit ($100m) from individuals and entities who had allegedly received funds laundered through accounts linked to Najib.

Funds had also been distributed to companies, political parties and organisations linked to Najibâs coalition, a list provided by the MACC and sighted by Al Jazeera showed.

This included entities under the previous ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and component parties United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress.

Malaysian and US investigators say about $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB, set up in 2009 by Najib.

âWe have issued compound notices against all of these people and entities for the purpose of them to pay up the fine,â Latheefa said, adding that they could be fined up to 2.5 times the amount received.

She said that the largest single sum being asked for was 134 million ringgit ($32m) from an entity.

Individuals who failed to pay their fines could face action against them by the MACC.

Najib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of corruption and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1bn in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.

A spokeswoman for Nazir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shahrir declined to comment.

In 2015, Nazir went on a leave of absence after the Wall Street Journal reported that he received about $7m from Najib and disbursed the funds to other politicians before elections in 2013.

An independent review into the money transfer concluded that Nazir did not misuse his position and there was no inappropriate use of the CIMBâs resources, following which Nazir resumed his duties as chairman. He resigned last year after almost three decades at the bank.

Nazir had received about 25.7 million ringgit in cheques, Latheefa said. She declined to confirm whether these were the same funds that Nazir had allegedly received in 2013.

After winning last yearâs election, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamadâs administration has reopened 1MDB probes, charged dozens of high-ranked officials, and filed civil forfeiture actions in a bid to recover money linked to 1MDB.

Since 2016, the US Department of Justice has filed forfeiture lawsuits on about $1.7bn in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds, including a private jet, luxury real estate and jewellery.",1

A powerful Ukrainian politician was the money man behind a secretive lobbying campaign orchestrated in Europe by disgraced U.S. lobbyist Paul Manafort, leaked emails reveal.

The campaign was meant to convince diplomats and politicians that Ukraines jailing of a prominent opposition leader should not prevent the country from signing an association agreement with the European Union.

Manaforts funder was Serhiy Lovochkin, today a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a leader of its largest opposition party. From 2010 to 2013, he was chief of staff to then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who would later flee to Russia after being overthrown in a popular revolution. Lovochkin had helped run Yanukovychs election campaign along with Manafort, who later served for a time as chairman of U.S. President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign.

The leaked emails also reveal that both Lovochkin and Manafort were involved in an insider scheme to benefit from the privatization of Ukraines public telecom operator.

In a case widely condemned by European leaders as politically motivated, opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted in October 2011 of harming Ukraines national interests during natural gas negotiations with Russia while she was prime minister.

Her sentencing imperilled an important free trade and association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that the Yanukovych administration hoped to sign in 2013.

Our friends in the West have not abandoned us, but they need help from us to withstand the pressure from the Tymoshenko supporters, Manafort wrote in an August 2011 memo to Yanukovych titled Strategy to offset Tymoshenko trial.

The memo was attached to one of thousands of emails obtained by OCCRP that document a decade of correspondence between Manafort, Lovochkin, and others, starting in 2008.

Part of Manaforts strategy was to recruit a Turkish politician and a trio of former European national leaders to promote the view that the association agreement should go forward despite Tymoshenkos imprisonment.

Some details of that lobbying campaign were exposed in Manaforts 2018 indictment, which followed the U.S. Department of Justice investigation led by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Manafort is now serving a prison sentence for tax and bank fraud charges stemming from that indictment, as well as for failing to register as a lobbyist on behalf of Yanukovychs government while attempting to influence American politicians.

Lovochkin was not named in the indictment. But the leaked emails reveal that he was the source of approximately 2 million euros funneled through accounts controlled by Manafort and used to pay lobbyists.

Late Payments

These lobbyists included Mevlut Cavusoglu, a former president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), who was first elected to Turkeys parliament in 2002 and now serves as the countrys foreign minister.

Manafort also recruited the Hapsburg Group, a shadowy informal outfit that consists of former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who previously served as European Commission President.

To coordinate the campaign, Manafort worked with Alan Friedman, an American ex-journalist who is a well-known political commentator and public relations consultant in Italy. Friedman was not charged over his role in the lobbying campaign.

All three members of the Hapsburg Group, as well as Cavusoglu and Friedman, were on Lovochkins payroll, the emails show. By mid-2013, however, Lovochkin was in arrears, and Gusenbauer grew concerned.

On the question of the outstanding payments I want to support you in pushing for a resolution soon, because the members of the Hapsburg Group are neither accustomed to nor willing to accept unjustified delays, Gusenbauer wrote to Friedman in July 2013.

Despite using the term to refer to himself and his colleagues, Gusenbauer told an Austrian news agency in 2018 that he had never heard of the Hapsburg Group. He told OCCRP he had nothing to add to those comments.

Friedman immediately forwarded Gusenbauers email to Manafort, and noted: H Group is pissed.

In order to preserve Sasha [Kwasniewski] and H group cooperation, we need to get three transfers done today or Monday, Friedman urged Manafort. This is becoming awkward.

Friedman also mentioned that he was awaiting a payment for his own work.

According to the email, the Hapsburg Group was owed 700,000 euros in advance for the second half of 2013. Additionally, Gusenbauer was owed for expenses for organizing conferences in the first half of 2013.

Cavusoglu needed a separate transfer of 230,000 euros, Friedman told Manafort, who had his assistant, Konstantin Kilimnik, send the email chain to Lovochkin on the day he received it.

Paul [Manafort] urgently requests SV [Serhiy Volodymrovich Lovochkin] be told the Hapsburg comrades are getting out of control because of non-payment of their services and asks to clarify what he should do, Kilimnik wrote to Lovochkins personal assistant, who forwarded the whole email chain to Lovochkins private address.

Lovochkin apparently paid up, as a conference put on by the Hapsburg Group in Paris went ahead in September as planned.

Conflicts of Interest

Lovochkins press office told OCCRP he had never supervised [the] work of Mr. Manafort.

Kwasniewski said he had not received money from Lovochkin or Friedman.

I dont know anything about the correspondence with people you are writing about, Kwasniewski said. I have received [an] honorarium for my participation at the conferences from the organizers.

He also denied that was unethical to promote the Ukraine governments objectives even as he was tasked by the European Parliament to monitor Tymoshenkos trial in 2012.

There was no conflict of interest with my mandate in the European Parliament and the conferences I have participated in, Kwasniewski told OCCRP. I had the same clear position on the need for Ukraine to sign the Association Agreement with the EU and about the must for releasing political prisoners.

But Kwasniewskis two roles were at odds, according to Stefan Meister, a Eurasia specialist with the Heinrich Böll Foundation.

Alexander Kwasniewski had a double role, working for Ukrainian oligarchs and the EU, Meister said. This creates conflicts of interest, which is indeed problematic.

Cavusoglu was also secretly lobbying while serving as a member of a PACE mission to observe Ukraines 2012 parliamentary elections.

Cavusoglu publicly advocated for the association agreement, while urging politicians not to criticize Ukraines government over the Tymoshenko case. He also gave positive reviews of the elections to media, contrary to assessments by international observation groups  including his own  that noted serious irregularities.

The European Parliament, for example, adopted a resolution on Dec. 13, 2012, expressing regret at the fact that, according to the OSCE, PACE, NATO Parliamentary Assembly and European Parliament observers, the election campaign, electoral process and post-electoral process failed to meet major international standards and constitute a step backwards.

Andreas Gross, who led the PACE observation mission, was critical of the electoral process and vocal about Tymoshenkos imprisonment, arguing that she had been jailed on political grounds without sufficient evidence of corruption.

Cavusoglu publicly condemned those comments, telling the news agency Interfax Ukraine that Gross was neither fair nor objective.

Gross told OCCRP that Cavusoglu often had controversial assessments of elections, but he was unaware that Cavusoglu had been engaged by the [Ukrainian] presidents lobby.

When you are indirectly or directly engaged and paid by the government or his consultants, you can never sign up for an observation mission in this same country, Gross said. The conflict of interest of Mevlut is obvious.

Although their activities may have been as unethical as they were lucrative, Cavusoglu and Kwasniewski do not appear to have broken any laws by lobbying while performing duties assigned to them by PACE and the European Parliament.

Neither Cavusoglu nor Prodi, the former Italian prime minister, responded to requests for comment.

In the end, the lobbying campaign orchestrated by Lovochkin and Manafort helped Yanukovych score a major political win. The EU offered Ukraine an association agreement even as its opposition leader was still detained.

But then, in a shocking about-face, Yanukovych refused to sign.

The reversal came after intense Russian pressure to halt the agreement, including the threat of trade disruption and political repercussions.

Yanukovychs choice of Russia over the EU sparked mass protests, which grew into a popular uprising that overturned his government. Accused of corruption and rights abuses, Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014, and parliament freed Tymoshenko from prison.

Ukraine signed an economic association agreement with the EU on June 27, 2014.

395,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Federal prosecutors charged Texas billionaire Robert Brockman on Thursday with a $2 billion tax fraud scheme in what they say is the largest such case against an American.
Department of Justice officials said at a news conference that Brockman, 79, hid capital gains income over 20 years through a web of offshore entities in Bermuda and Nevis and secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. Prosecutors announced that the CEO of a private equity firm that aided in the schemes would cooperate with the investigation.

The 39-count indictment unsealed Thursday charges Brockman, the chief executive officer of Ohio-based software company Reynolds and Reynolds Co., with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses.
Prosecutors also announced that Robert F. Smith, founder and chairman of Vista Equity Partners, will cooperate in the investigation and pay $139 million to settle his own tax probe. Smith, 57, stunned a senior class last year when he promised to wipe out the student loan debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse, a historically Black all-male college.

Complexity will not hide crime from law enforcement. Sophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges, said David L. Anderson, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California. We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.
Brockman appeared in federal court from Houston via Zoom Thursday. He entered a plea of not guilty to all counts and was released on $1 million bond, said Abraham Simmons, spokesman for the Northern District of California.
Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges, said his attorney, Kathryn Keneally, in an email.
Prosecutors said Brockman used encrypted emails with code names, including Permit, Snapper, Redfish and Steelhead, to carry out the fraud and ordered evidence to be manipulated or destroyed.
Brockman, a resident of Houston and Pitkin County, Colorado, is chairman and CEO of Reynolds and Reynolds, a 4,300-employee company near Dayton, Ohio, that sells accounting, sales and management software to auto dealerships. The software helps set up websites, including live chats with potential customers, find loans and calculate customer payments, manage payroll and pay bills.
Reynolds & Reynolds issued a statement saying the allegations were outside Brockmans work with the company and that the company is not alleged to have participated in any wrongdoing.
In 2013, a charitable trust set up by Brockmans late father withdrew a pledged $250 million donation to Centre College, a small liberal arts school in Danville, Kentucky, where Brockman attended class and once served as chairman of the board of trustees.
At the time the school said it was due to a significant capital market event that didnt pan out. A spokesman for Reynolds and Reynolds said in 2013 that the event was a proposed refinancing deal involving Vista Equity Partners, Smiths company.
According to the indictment, Brockman gave an unnamed individual detailed instructions regarding the proposed gift to the college, including talking points, and directed the person to threaten to pull out if his demands were not met. In August, he instructed the person to cancel the gift.
Prosecutors say that Smith used about $2.5 million in untaxed funds to buy and upgrade a vacation home in Sonoma, California; purchase two ski properties in France; and spend $13 million to buy a property and fund charitable activities at his property in Colorado.
Anderson applauded Smith for stepping up, despite the serious nature of his crimes, which occurred from 2000 to mid-2015.
Smiths agreement to cooperate has put him on a path away from indictment, he said.
In 2019, Smith announced to the graduating class at Morehouse College that he would pay off the student loan debt of the entire class, saying that he expected the graduates to pay it forward. The estimated cost was $40 million.

869,"ABU DHABI, 20th October, 2020 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Justice has called upon law firms to take all necessary measures to ensure anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing obligations are respected.

Law firms were also asked to take the necessary legal measures against offenders under Federal Decree 20 of 2018 in relation to money laundering, its executive regulations, and relevant ministerial decisions as part of the UAE's efforts to address the risks associated with financial crimes.

The Ministry emphasised the importance of law firms' role in combating money laundering, as well as the need for lawyers to assume their role in fighting this crime and identifying risks, handling clients, reporting suspicious transactions, and maintaining proper records.

The Ministry announced that it had recently taken legal action against non-compliant lawyers as part of controls and procedures in this regard, including the decision to suspend 200 law firms from practicing for one month due to non-compliance with established procedures to combat money laundering.

The Ministry noted that penalties included the suspension and cancellation of professional licences, as well as the imposition of administrative fines ranging from 50,000 to 5 million dirhams.

In recent months, the Ministry of Justice has asked all registered lawyers to access the ""Smart Lawyer"" system on the Ministry's website (elawyer.moj.gov.ae), or to contact the Ministryâs money laundering department to update their information in Arabic and English, appoint a compliance officer for each office, and fill out questionnaires relating to procedural compliance. They were also directed through various official media and social media outlets to take all necessary measures to avoid administrative penalties.

The Ministry explained that the suspension of law firms would be lifted once lawyers in charge of the department's legal management office prove that they have carried out procedures to fulfill their obligations under Ministerial Resolution 533 of 2019 on combating money laundering.

The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is of utmost priority for the UAE, with a Ministerial Higher Committee overseeing the National Strategy on Anti-Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism being established under the chairmanship of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.",0
92,"Eta claim independence for seven regions in Spain and France

Three suspected Eta bomb plotters arrested in Britain last year have been extradited to Spain, police have said.

The three suspects include men aged 24 and 29 and a woman aged 36. They were arrested in April in Sheffield.

They are accused by the Spanish authorities of involvement in a 2006 bomb attack on a naval office building.

The names of the three extradited suspects are: Inigo Albisu Hernandez, 24, Zigor Ruiz Jaso, 29, and Ana Isabel Lopez Monge, 36.

Their extradition was ordered on 17 August last year. Their removal from the country follows all of their appeals having been exhausted.

Bloody campaign

The three were extradited on a flight that left at 1200 GMT.

Lawyers for the group had appealed against their extradition on the basis that the arrest warrants they had been detained under were defective.

The lawyers had argued that returning them to Spain would expose them to inhumane and degrading treatment.

At the time their extradition orders were made, City of Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the three suspects had come together as a ""reserve cell"" after a former ""command"" had been stood down.

Franco dictatorship

Melanie Cumberland, representing the Spanish judicial authority, said Ruiz was alleged to have carried out the February 2006 attack, for which Eta claimed responsibility, in Motrico, Spain.

No-one was hurt in the attack, although there was damage done to property.

For more than three decades, Eta waged a bloody campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France that Basque separatists claim as their own.

Euskadi Ta Azkatasuna, or Eta, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, first emerged in the 1960s as a student resistance movement bitterly opposed to General Franco's repressive military dictatorship.

Following the Spanish Civil War, the Basque language was banned - although it was being taught in private schools by the 1950s - the Basque's distinctive culture suppressed and intellectuals imprisoned and tortured for their political and cultural beliefs.",1
42,"Law enforcement agencies in Boston have charged a Ukrainian national with hacking, credit card trafficking and money laundering conspiracies in a $94 million case.

According to the US Attorneyâs Office in the District of Massachusetts, Vitalii Antonenko, 28, (and residing in New York), was indicted on one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorised access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorised access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

In March 2019, Antonenko was arrested and detained on money laundering charges at New Yorkâs John F. Kennedy International Airport after he arrived there from Ukraine carrying computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.

Last year, Antonenkoâs lawyers requested a psychiatric evaluation as they said he had difficulty communicating and suggested he is covertly working for the CIA. (Reminds me of the 2002 movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.)

In this latest development, heâs only been charged, but depending on the outcome Antonenko could face 20 years in jail and be fined up to $500,000 over the money laundering conspiracy.

As alleged in the indictment, Antonenko and (unnamed) co-conspirators scoured the internet for computer networks with security vulnerabilities that were likely to contain credit and debit card account numbers, expiration dates, and card verification values (payment card data) and other personally identifiable information (PII).

They used a hacking technique known as a âSQL injection attackâ to access those networks without authorisation, extracted payment card data and other PII, and transferred it for sale on online criminal marketplaces. Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership and control.

US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the US Secret Service Boston Field Office made the announcement. Assistant US Attorney Seth B. Kosto of Lellingâs Cybercrime Unit is prosecuting the case.

The US Attorneyâs Office reminds everyone the details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often get a bad rap. Why? Usually because of the criminal activities linked to it. There are too many stories to mention, but just this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement action in the US against a dastardly Dane for his $1.5 million foreign currency (forex) fraud scheme and registration violations.

Client funds were withdrawn from the US bank accounts by Casper Mikkelsen through his debit card, as well as transferred from the US bank accounts to an overseas bank, and from there to a Bitcoin address for Mikkelsenâs benefit. Mikkelsen then used the money to pay certain clients purported forex trading profits as is typical in a Ponzi scheme.",1
573,"STANBIC SUED FOR

Stanbic Bank Zambia Limited has been sued by Blackfire Mining Limited,demanding US$125,000 as damages for breach of contract after the bank allowed a former director for the mine to fraudulently transfer money to his personal account.

And Blackfire Mining Limited has reported five Stanbic Bank employees to the police in Ndola for fraud after the bank negligently allowed a former director in the mining firm, David Lance Morris to withdraw US$125,000, when the bank was instructed not to allow such a transaction.

In a statement of claim filed in the Kabwe High Court, Blackfire Mining is claiming damages for breach of contract from the bank after it allowed Morris, who was removed as a director on July 2, 2020 following a board of directors resolution, to withdraw money from the company account held at Stanbic.
The plaintiff notified the bank on July 3, 2020 that Morris was forthwith not allowed to conduct any business or operations on any of its accounts maintained with the bank.
The mining firm stated further that the bank was on July 15, 2020 served with a letter alongside an order of injunction by its lawyers Magubbwi and Associates and were also informed that Morris was not to conduct any business on the company accounts.
The plaintiff added that the police on July 2, 2020 served a warrant on the bank restricting debit transactions on the accounts as well as online transactions on Morriss personal accounts to which company funds were being transfered to.
But contrary to its instructions to the bank, Morris between June 29, 2020 and July 13, 2020, fraudulently made transfers from the company accounts to his personal and other accounts of his choice.
The plaintiff stated that Morris transfered US$5000, US$10,000 and US$125,000 on June 29, 2020.
He also transfered US$5,000 on July 9, 2020, another US$10,000 on July 11, 2020 and US$100,000 on July 13, 2020.

The plaintiff stated that Morris was reported to the Zambia Police for fraudulent withdraw of money from the companys account.",1
242,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been rebuked by the U.S. Ethics Office after selling his stake in a film production company, which heâd promised to divest from, to his own wife, Louise Linton. Whoops!

The office said that, because of this, they wonât certify Mnuchinâs 2018 financial disclosure statement, according to a Thursday report in the New York Times. Mnuchin has promised to distance himself from the company, and wonât face any penalties for the sale.

From the Times:

Mr. Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then-fiancÃ©e, Louise Linton, as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary. Since they are now married, government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr. Mnuchin, potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China. [...]

Mr. Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms. Linton, an actress and producer. However, the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it.

Mnuchin isnât the first Trump official to be scorned by the ethics office. Just last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also told that his disclosure statement couldnât be certified because of an inaccuracy.

An attorney for the Treasury Department, Brian J. Sonfield, wrote a letter to the Ethics department this week explaining that Mnuchinâs sale had been cleared by the department, and that he believes the sale is âconsistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations.â

Mnuchin has now promised he will recuse himself from any business that could potentially have an impact on the production company.

But not having your financial records certified by the ethics office is a big deal, and extremely rare, according to the Times.

This isnât Mnuchinâs first ethics scandal. Last year, for instance, the Center for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington found that Mnuchin had âbetween the spring and fall of 2017, [taken] eight separate trips on military aircraft at a total cost of nearly $1 million.â

âThose records make clear that Secretary Mnuchin has legitimately earned a place in the roguesâ gallery of cabinet secretaries who have abused their all too easy access to military and other non-commercial aircraft for both business travel and what, upon closer inspection, appears to sometimes include personal travel,â the group said at the time.

Democrats pointed out that whatever Mnuchin says, his actions were a violation of his promise to divest from the company.

âBefore being confirmed by the Senate, he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L.L.C.,â Senator Ron Wyden, the highest ranked Democrat on the Finance Committee, told the Times. âRather than divest, he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then-fiancÃ©e and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage.â",1

Washington, DC â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider whom improperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of Syrian regime officials. This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider whom improperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of Syrian regime officials. This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

""Rami Makhluf has used intimidation and his close ties to the Asad regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians,"" said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The Asad regime's cronyism and corruption has a corrosive effect, disadvantaging innocent Syrian businessmen and entrenching a regime that pursues oppressive and destabilizing policies, including beyond Syria's borders, in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories.""

Syria is well known for its corrupt business environment, which denies the Syrian people economic prosperity and other freedoms. The considerable role the Asad family, their inner circle, and the Syrian security services exert over the economy, coupled with the absence of a free judicial system and the lack of transparency, concentrates wealth in the hands of certain classes and individuals. In turn, these classes and individuals depend upon this corrupt system for their success and fortune. Syrians without these connections are unable to improve their economic standing, and suffer as a result of policies implemented by an unaccountable regime.

President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13460 on February 13, 2008 to take additional measures to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by certain conduct of the Government of Syria.

This new authority builds on E.O. 13338, which was issued by President Bush in May 2004, by targeting activities that entrench and enrich the Syrian regime and its cohorts thereby enabling the regime to continue to engage in threatening behavior, including actions that undermine efforts to stabilize Iraq. Corruption by the regime also reinforces efforts that deny the people of Syria political freedoms and economic prosperity, undercut peace and stability in the region, fund terrorism and violence, and undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon.

Pursuant to E.O. 13460, any assets that Makhluf holds under U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in business or transactions with Makhluf.

Rami Makhluf is a powerful Syrian businessman who amassed his commercial empire by exploiting his relationships with Syrian regime members. Makhluf has manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals. He employed these techniques when trying to acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign companies in Syria and to obtain contract awards.

Makhluf is the maternal cousin of President Bashar al-Asad and through this relationship, Makhluf has become a focal point of Syria's telecommunications, commercial, oil, gas and banking sectors. Despite President Asad's highly publicized anti-corruption campaigns, Makhluf remains one of the primary centers of corruption in Syria.

Makhluf's influence with certain Syrian government officials has led to his being able to control the issuance of certain types of profitable commodities contracts. His close business associations with some Syrian cabinet ministers have enabled him to gain access to lucrative oil exploration and power plant projects. Makhluf's preferential access to Syrian economic sectors has led to complaints about him from members of the Syrian business community.

Makhluf is the brother of Syrian General Intelligence Directorate official Hafiz Makhluf, who was previously designated under E.O. 13441.",1

The Senegalese, 87, faced corruption and money-laundering charges linked to the Russian doping scandal.

Diack was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was sentenced to four years in prison, two of them suspended.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".

Diack, who was also given a maximum fine of 500,000 euros (Â£456,928), was investigated by French authorities for four years over claims he took payments of more than 3m euros to cover up cheating.

The judge said his actions had ""undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping"".

Diack has been under house arrest in Paris since November 2015.

Previously one of the most influential figures in world sport, Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics' Federations - now World Athletics - for 16 years until he was replaced by Britain's Lord Coe in August 2015.

Diack's son Papa Massata Diack - who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 - was sentenced to five years in prison and a given a 1m euros fine (Â£913,850).

After the ruling, World Athletics released a statement in which it said it was ""disappointed this happened in our sport"" but ""grateful for the strong and clear decisions that have been taken against the individuals involved"".

Athletics' governing body added that it would like to ""reassure everyone that the reforms our congress approved in 2016 will ensure that similar actions by individuals can never happen again in our sport"".

""We are grateful for the damages awarded by the Paris Criminal Court totalling 16m euros for embezzled funds and for reputational damage suffered as a direct consequence of these crimes and the resulting media coverage,"" it added.

""As the court acknowledged, this damage has impacted World Athletics' finances and had a negative impact on World Athletics' image and reputation in a deep and lasting way. We will do everything we can to recover the monies awarded, and return them to the organisation for the development of athletics globally.""",1
623,"BOSTON  An Acton investment advisor and financial planner pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing more than $3.7 million from more than 20 clients over a 10-year period when authorities determined he filtered client funds into his own personal accounts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced.

Gerald Eaton, 51, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft on Wednesday and is scheduled to be sentenced in early 2021, according to a news release.

According to officials, Eaton worked as a certified financial planner and did business under the name of Heritage Financial Group. According to the complaint, Eaton invested client funds in securities and various insurance products, including life insurance policies and annuities. Authorities say between 1999 and 2019, Eaton stole nearly $4 million in client money from their accounts through selling securities, insurance policies and other accounts and had the proceeds moved to accounts that he either owned or personally controlled.

The U.S. Attorney's Office said that during this time, Eaton also forged clients' signatures on checks and other financial documents or convinced clients to sign documents that he said would lead to proceeds that would benefit his clients financially. Instead, authorities said he filtered funds to his credit card accounts to pay his personal and family expenses and also filtered money to a home equity line of credit. The complaint states that Eaton defrauded clients that he believed either would not notice money was gone from their accounts and also targeted clients who were elderly and were in poor physical or mental condition.

Eaton also lied to his firm and to various insurance companies that the transactions he was brokering were being carried out to benefit his clients, authorities said in the complaint against Eaton.

Eaton faces up to 20 years in prison for the mail and wire fraud charges along with three years of supervised probation and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain/loss, whichever is greater, the news release stated. The identity theft charge carries a two-year sentence, which would be served consecutive to any other prison sentence, one year of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 and restitution.

In addition to the prison sentence he faces, Eaton has been barred from working in the securities industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1
941,"Tens of thousands bid farewell to the silent screen goddess at her funeral, which was dubbed the most spectacular funeral of the century by The New York Times. Film historian Mark Cousins wrote in Prospect that the procession through Shanghai was three miles (4.8 km) long, and during the march three other women committed suicide, so overcome were they by their grief for Ruan. The funeral was far beyond even that for Rudolph Valentino, the Hollywood silent film star whose death in 1926 only heightened his romantic appeal.

But in 2001, two other versions of Ruans suicide note surfaced. In one of the notes, the late actress blamed the womaniser tycoon Tang for mistreating her and breaking her heart, while accusing Zhang of his malicious act in shaming her publicly. There was great public speculation about which of these notes most got to the heart of why she did it  in part because of the phenomenal success of Centre Stage and Maggie Cheungs portrayal of Ruan. Cheung won the best actress prize at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1992 for her performance in Centre Stage, which the US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum named as the best film of the 1990s.

A couple of years later, in 1994, a stage drama about Ruans life was performed in Beijing  it was revived for another run in 2013. And the actress Jacklyn Wu Chien-lien would go on to portray Ruan in a Chinese TV series about her life that spanned 30 episodes.

The true cause for Ruans suicide remains a mystery. But regardless of the reasons for her untimely death, Ruan accomplished a great deal in her short life as the brightest star of early Chinese cinema.

Daljit Kaur Yinder Singh, 50, was jailed for four months on Wednesday (Oct 14) for her crimes.

She pleaded guilty to three charges of making false entries with intent to defraud the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), engaging in a conspiracy to give false information to MSF, and abetting her co-accused to cheat MSF. Another two charges were taken into consideration.

The court heard that Daljit was a centre supervisor at Welcare Student Care Centre from 2002 to June 2015, working under co-accused Gerard Michael, who owned the centre. She supervised the children and liaised with parents on the government-funded Student Care Fee Assistance scheme.

Student care centres under the scheme must submit withdrawal forms to MSF if parents withdraw their children from the centre, so the ministry would stop the disbursement and collect any refunds for excess funds.

Michael instructed Daljit not to submit forms for children who withdrew, and also told her to make false entries in attendance books and prepare supporting documents so it appeared as if the children were still attending the centre.

She did not inform MSF of the withdrawals of 12 children, and MSF disbursed excess subsidies of S$13,630 to Welcare between January 2015 and May 2015.

The centre made a total of S$48,280 in illegal claims between 2014 and 2016. Of this, S$29,410 of losses caused to MSF was from Daljit's conspiracy with Michael. Welcare has returned S$28,762 to MSF, and S$19,518 remains outstanding.

SHE LIED TO HELP HIS MOTHER OBTAIN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

Separately, Michael also instructed Daljit to apply for ComCare for his mother in January 2015. ComCare is a government financial assistance scheme for needy households.

Acting on Michael's instructions, Daljit went to a social services office in Ang Mo Kio with Michael's mother and lied to the officer that his mother was jobless and did not have financial support from her children.

MSF approved the application and helped Michael's mother pay for rental and conservancy charges for six months. It also credited S$340 per month into her bank account and gave her a medical assistance card.

Daljit's lawyer said his client has indicated that she is willing to be a prosecution witness against Michael in his trial, and said she was ""a mere pawn"" used by him. The offences were committed at a low point in her life when she was ""blinded by love"" for Michael, said the lawyer.

The judge agreed that Daljit was not the mastermind, but said she should not have complied with the instructions given.",1
431,"LONDON: Marriott International Inc, the world's largest hotel operator, is facing a London class action brought by millions of former hotel guests demanding compensation after their personal data was hacked in one of the largest data breaches in history.

Martin Bryant, founder of technology and media consultancy Big Revolution, is leading the claim for English and Welsh-domiciled guests after more than 300 million customer records from Marriott's global database, potentially including passport and credit card details, were hacked between 2014 and 2018.

""I hope this case will raise awareness of the value of our personal data, result in fair compensation ... and also serve notice to other data owners that they must hold our data responsibly,"" he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for loss of control of personal data, automatically includes guests who made a reservation for one of the former Starwood brand hotels - including Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and St. Regis hotels - before Sept. 10, 2018.

Bryant is represented by law firm Hausfeld and the case is funded by Harbour Litigation.

Around seven million UK guest records were involved, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which last year proposed a 99.2 million pound (US$133 million) fine over the breach.

A London-based spokeswoman for Marriott was not immediately available for comment.

Marriott announced in 2018 that hackers had accessed its Starwood hotels reservation database and notified the FBI.

""We fell short of what our guests deserve,"" Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said at the time.

Attorneys filed a lawsuit in a Maryland federal court within hours of the disclosure. Others followed suit in the U.S. and Canada.

The London class action has been filed in the High Court after a landmark Court of Appeal decision last October that a collective action could be served against Internet giant Google over alleged unlawful tracking of iPhone users in 2011 and 2012 through third party cookies.

Google is appealing.

388,"Sirleaf was a deputy governor of the institution during the period when the bank notes were illegally ordered. He was arrested along with two central bank colleagues on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The director of banking, Dorbor Hagba, was also arrested on Thursday, while Milton Weeks - central bank governor until he stepped down when President George Weah took office in January 2018 - surrendered to police the next day.

Two other men, named as accomplices, have been evading arrest, according to police. The death of a former senior central bank official on Saturday attracted further public interest in the case. Matthew J. Innis, the institution's one-time deputy director for micro-finance in the regulation and supervision division, was reportedly killed in a hit-and-run road incident.

The American aid agency USAID and the Liberian government funded the investigations which were launched last year in October following the suspected disappearance of newly printed notes worth $100 million (88 million) destined for the Liberian central bank - the equivalent of around 5 percent of the West African nation's gross domestic product.

A London-based firm, Kroll, was hired to carry out the audit. The supposed disappearance led to a travel departure ban on 15 people, including Charles Sirleaf.

""Kroll has identified discrepancies at every stage of the process for controlling the movement of banknotes into and out of the (central bank),"" the risk consultancy said in its report that had been commissioned by the United States at the request of the Liberian government.

$16.5 million missing

A Liberian government report found that notes worth $16.5 million remained unaccounted for and said the bank's management ""deviated from conventional best practices.""

In 2016, Liberia's House of Representatives passed a resolution approving the printing of 5 billion Liberian dollars (US$31 million; 27 million).

The Central Bank requested an additional 10 billion Liberian dollars but the request was denied by the Senate. The bank engaged a company to print the additional banknotes anyway.

""This raised the risk of unintended negative economic effect, including high inflation and the rapid depreciation"" of the Liberian dollar, the report said.

Kroll said its investigation found no evidence of a large shipment of cash going missing as had been reported by local media. Instead, the new bank notes all arrived from a Swedish company but the central bank then failed to properly track what was done with them, the report said.

The report said most of the bank notes are believed to have been put into circulation without authorities removing and destroying the old bills they were designed to replace.

Anderson Miamen, executive director of CENTAL in Liberia, believes that the money went into the pockets of individuals: ""It means the money was misapplied, and misapplication means converting property that is not yours into your personal benefit.""

""If the money isn't available and there is no record of the money being infused into the economy, it means it has to be somewhere.

""And that somewhere would be in private accounts of individuals connected to the process.""

Liberians anxious and disappointed

The report said officials at the central bank were unable to explain who approved the injection of new bank notes without removing the old ones or how the money was infused into the Liberian economy.

Mark Dahen, a Liberian journalist. finds the situation ""utterly embarrassing.""

""Many Liberians were anxious about this report and have been disappointed since this news broke about the missing 16 billion Liberian dollars.""

Several organizations have been pressuring the government to ensure that concrete actions come from this investigation, he told DW.

Critics of President George Weah's government have accused his administration of having had a hand in the poor handling of the bank notes for their personal gain, an allegation they have denied.

Miamen underlined that the malpractice is, first of all, a failure of the government.

""But it is also the failure of the oversight body or the internal control system of the bank.""

He believes that the problem lies with how Liberia is dealing with impunity: ""I can point to the lack of action on or against individuals who [...] abuse their power.""

""What needs to happen is to address impunity on a broader level in this country.""

""The second thing is if institutions or the different agencies were effectively playing their role, if internal controls system were actually exercising their responsibility and doing due diligence, we would have probably not gotten to this point,"" he said.

Not the first Sirleaf scandal

Dahen told DW he believes that this is just more proof that having family members of important politicians in high positions at economic institutions is difficult.

""This is not the first time that members of the Sirleaf family have been the source of scandal. Some years back, Robert Sirleaf was also implicated in some corrupt practices.""

Robert Sirleaf, another son of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was the chairman of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), that went bankrupt under his chairmanship in 2016.

Under his management, 30 million to 40 million US dollars disappeared.

""Generally we can see that there were incidences of corruption or scandals that were reported under the Sirleaf administration."" Miamen said

""Some of the children or family members of the president had very high positions or lucrative positions in government. So this is not a strange news really, in the sense of family members of the president being at the center of kind of controversy.

""Given the incidences of corruption and the dubious nature of some of the dealings under the then leadership of Sirleaf, we can see that it is not strange that something like this is coming up.""

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf herself was listed in the Paradise Papers 2012 as a director of a Bermuda-based financial company.

282,"Prosecutors in Brazil filed charges against Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating a bribery scheme in 2009 when he was governor of Mato Grosso state.

Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutor's office.

Maggi denies any wrongdoing, the press office of the agriculture minister said in a written statement.

Under Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision, Reuters reports.

Dodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court US$3.4 million in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.

Almeida was removed from the court last year and faces a trial in a lower-level federal court in connection with the supposed scheme.",1
1002,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has introduced a bill to raise penalties for securities-law violations, seeking to pass legislation that stalled in two previous efforts.

The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act of 2017 would increase the limits on civil fines and expand the ability of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to link the penalty size to how much money is gained by those responsible for a violation, or lost by victims.

This bipartisan bill will enhance the ability of securities regulators to protect investors, deter Wall Street fraud, and punish repeat offenders, said co-sponsor Jack Reed. Investors deserve real protection, and the law needs to change to ensure the punishment fits the crime. This bill gives the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street.

The bill sets maximum fines for the most serious securities violations at whichever is greater: $1 million per violation for individuals, and $10 million per violation for institutions, or three times the money gained in the violation or lost by the victims.

The current fine limits are $181,071 for individuals and $905,353 for firms.

The SEC can now levy a penalty directly linked to the ill-gotten gains only if an enforcement case goes to federal court. The newly proposed legislation would permit the SEC to pursue these larger fines through its administrative process, held before an SEC administrative law judge.

The bill also triples the penalty cap applicable to repeat offenders who have been held liable either criminally or in civil securities fraud cases in the prior five years.

The legislation, dubbed the SEC Penalties Act for short, was sponsored by Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, and Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota.

The goal of this legislation is to create meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent to crack down on fraud, Reed said in a press release announcing the bill.

The proposed legislation has far to go before becoming law but the sponsors expressed optimism. It must first be considered by the Senate Banking Committee.

The Republican chairman of the committee, Mike Crapo, and top Democrat Sherrod Brown welcomed the bipartisan effort. This committee should be discussing ways to strengthen penalties and maximize their deterrent effect, not weaken them, Brown said. In fact, Senator Reed has introduced a bi-partisan bill to enhance civil penalties under the securities laws. . It is bills like that one and others that I hope we can consider this Congress.

Support in the House of Representatives is unclear, as is whether President Donald Trump would eventually sign such a bill into law.

SENDING A MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE AND BI-PARTISANSHIP

Even in todays sharply partisan environment, in which the Republican administration is seeking to deregulate Wall Street and Democrats are fighting to preserve the Dodd-Frank regulatory structure, the bipartisanship shown over the penalties bill may not come as a total surprise.

Politicians and their constituents have had Wall Street in their crosshairs ever since the financial crisis and the industry has been an easy target.

This bill could be low hanging fruit that displays both bipartisan cooperation and determination to crack down on financial crime. However, this will be the third legislative attempt. The measure is essentially identical to efforts introduced in 2012 and 2015 which ultimately failed to become law.

When asked what was different this time, a Reed press aide, This bipartisan bill has not changed and neither has our resolve to protect investors and strengthen oversight and accountability of Wall Street.

It often takes several years to pass meaningful legislation  and well keep at it, the aide said.

In his statement for the Congressional Record (here) Reed said, ""we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist.""

Grassley said the SEC needs strong penalties to protect the securities markets from bad actors.

If a fine is just decimal dust for a Wall Street firm, thats not a deterrent, Grassley said. Its just the cost of doing business. A penalty should mean something, and it should get the recidivists attention. I welcome the increased penalties for repeat offenders in this bill. That step should help change the dynamic of business as usual.

Heitkamp said the law would help shield small investors from fraud.

With the SEC coming off a record year of fines (here) totaling more than $4 billion in 548 enforcements in fiscal year 2016, the bar is set high for the agency to surpass the penalty totals. This bill could help keep the fines rolling in.

735,"Ping An's OneConnect shares its expertise to strengthen the world's financial institutions

OneConnect Financial Technology Co Ltd, the fintech arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd, is coasting on the Belt and Road Initiative to expand its overseas layout. In doing so, it is meeting the financing needs of local companies in the markets it operates in.

Currently, OneConnect's overseas business spans 15 countries and regions, including Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and Germany. It is constantly expanding into BRI-related economies.

Jessica Tan, Ping An Group's co-CEO, said: ""The reason why our fintech was able to cover more than a dozen countries and regions in 18 months is that we don't compete for customers with local enterprises. Instead, we export fintech. We have over 10 years of experience in fintech. We would like to help local enterprises increase their efficiency and lower costs.""

As an active enabler of the BRI, OneConnect serves local companies across East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe. It endeavors to support key areas related to the initiative, including facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, and financial integration, Tan said.

In July, OneConnect signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Global Market in the United Arab Emirates to develop technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and distributed ledger. In June, it tied up with UBX, a subsidiary of Union Bank in the Philippines, to build the country's first blockchain-enabled technology platform.

The technology platform offers services, including AI analysis, remote review, and anti-fraud scrutiny, to meet local enterprises' digital-age needs like multi-channel loan application processing, credit evaluation, loan appropriation and customer identity verification.

In addition, it can effectively reduce credit approval time, and provide more accurate risk assessment, OneConnect executives said.

Bin Ru Tan, chief executive officer of OneConnect Southeast Asia, said: ""Banks and insurance companies recognize that digital adoption is here to stay and now is an opportune time to accelerate digitalization. We are seeing strong demand for our smart interview, digital banking, and smart lending solutions as they support a truly seamless remote banking experience.

""Having grown our footprint across Southeast Asia, today we have amassed extensive domain knowledge when it comes to understanding the local financial landscape and regulations. We have successfully collaborated with top financial institutions and leading third-party service providers to build end-to-end digital solutions and ecosystems that are highly relevant to the local markets.""

Wang Penghu, general manager of the company finance department of China Citic Bank, said that banks' digital transformation makes inclusive finance possible. Digitalization also contributes to precise marketing, and lowers the banks' customer acquisition service costs, he said.

A report from accounting firm EY(previously Ernst & Young) showed that 85 percent of the banks around the world have made digital transformation the focus of their future work.

Unsurprisingly, OneConnect has been very busy. It has been helping financial institutions in making the required digital transformation. In China, the company has served all of the country's major banks in less than four years. And 99 percent of the country's city commercial banks, and 52 percent of insurance companies, have been empowered with digital transformation. Outside China, OneConnect is making similar inroads into the global financial services industry.

""OneConnect is able to make contributions to the advancement of the financial services industry in Asia, and even the world. We are confident that we can make even more significant contributions, going forward,"" Bin Ru Tan said.

OneConnect's overseas expansion began in Southeast Asia. The region is home to a rapidly rising middle-income class as well as an evergrowing number of internet users. But, modern financial infrastructure is conspicuous by its absence.

For instance, bank card and bank account penetration rates in the region are low. Only a few people of the overall population use credit cards. The credit reporting system is weak. Many people still rely on cash.

OneConnect hopes to introduce Chinese experience and fintech expertise to the region, to quickly bridge the financial services gap and increase the penetration rate of inclusive finance.

Currently, in Thailand, three of the top 10 banks are served by One-Connect, while in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines, OneConnect has made inroads into the local markets by establishing subsidiaries or is working with local enterprises.

""Using our smart finance platform, we included over 70 percent of the small and micro enterprises in the supply chain credit system, greatly increasing their financing possibilities. The fintech solution, which has already proved effective in China, unlocks the vitality of small and micro enterprises in Southeast Asia and boosts the economic development of the countries in the region,"" Bin Ru Tan said.

""We will ramp up our efforts so that the countries can achieve the same good results as in China.""

In the future, more fintech projects will be undertaken in countries and regions related to the BRI, so that the dividends of Chinese technology can benefit a wider range of communities and peoples, company executives said.",0
703,"Brussels has redoubled efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing with proposals to give the European Banking Authority (EBA) a powerful new mandate to impose sanctions directly on the banks of member states.

A series of measuresthat would make Europeâs banking supervisor the ultimate arbiter in the most serious cross-border money-laundering cases were announced to coincide with the European commission president Jean-Claude Junckerâs annual state of the union speech on Wednesday.

Europe is under pressure to respond following a series of recent scandals including the collapse of ABLV Bank in Latvia and the freezing of assets at Pilatus Bank in Malta following allegations of sanctions busting by its Iranian owner.

Investigations such as the Panama Papers and the Global Laundromat series, which revealed the movement of $21bn (Â£16bn) in dirty funds from Russia, have underlined how poor supervision by member states and a lack of cross-border cooperation between law enforcement agencies is allowing money to flow from countries with high levels of corruption into Europe.

âAnti-money laundering supervision has failed all too often in the EU,â said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president for financial services policy at the commission. He said enhancing the powers of the EBA would ensure âdifferent supervisors cooperate and exchange information and that anti-money laundering rules are enforced effectively across EU countriesâ.

The proposals, which must be agreed by member states and the European parliament, would be fast tracked by amending existing legislation.

The EBA would be able to order national regulators to investigate breaches and specify remedies such as sanctions. If national regulators failed to act, the commission explained in a memo on Wednesday, the EBA would have the power to step in âto address decisions directlyâ to banks.

The EBAâs head office is in London, but it will relocate to Paris after Britain leaves the EU in March.

The agency would be asked to act as a data hub, collecting information on money-laundering risks and trends and fostering exchange of information between national authorities. It would also facilitate cooperation with non-EU countries in cross-border cases.

The commission wants a new, permanent committee to bring together national anti-money laundering supervisors.

âSeveral recent cases of money laundering in European banks have given rise to concerns that gaps remain in the unionâs supervisory framework,â the commission said in its briefing.

It also highlighted âdelayed supervisory reactions and shortcomings with respect to cooperation and information sharingâ both at domestic level, between prudential and anti-money laundering authorities, and across borders between authorities in different member states or countries outside of Europe.

Members of the European parliament have been calling for the creation of a single cross-border agency to step in when national regulators fail to police their banks.

Concerns about regulatory failings have not been limited to smaller member states. In September, an investigation commissioned by Denmarkâs largest bank found $30bn of Russian and other former Soviet bloc money was pumped through its Estonian branch in a single year.

The MEP Molly Scott Cato, a member of the economic and monetary affairs committee, welcomed the proposals.

âWe need this proposal to be brought into law urgently â and certainly during this parliamentary mandate â to protect the integrity of the European financial system,â she said.",0

1067,"Action against corporates by financial regulators demonstrating they are widening their focus and bringing corporates into the world of financial crime compliance is well documented. Non-compliance can attract heavy fines and the risk of reputational damage which would be considered reckless, at best.

Regulations to combat financial crime include anti-money laundering (AML) laws, financial sanctions and monitoring of high-risk individuals. Sanctions are among the most challenging of the financial crime regulations for corporations. In addition to jurisdictional issues, operational decisions on matters such as sanctions list management, transaction currency, customer or employee nationality, local employment laws and transaction routing must be considered.

The multi-jurisdictional challenge

The majority of economic sanctions emanate from the US and Europe. The US Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has recently fined a number of firms  including those operating outside of the US  for sanctions violations. In fact, three of the four entities fined by OFAC for sanctions violations early this year, were corporations and compliance experts believe that the size and scale of fines for corporates is set to grow.

OFAC administers a number of different sanctions programs, covering countries such as Syria, Iran and Russia as well as specially designated nationals (SDNs) who are defined in almost 60 different lists. The sanctions are either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to meet the foreign policy and national security goals of the US.

Other countries, such as the UK and France, have similar bodies to monitor those suspected of financial crime.

Corporates playing catchup

With regulators clearly signalling their intention to take a closer look at corporate compliance with international sanctions, making the assumption that a bank is responsible for protecting its corporate clients against potential violations will not be a mitigating factor when it comes to regulatory action.

As businesses expand across borders, the exposure to potential violations increases and can extend to off-shore affiliates. Many corporates are playing catch up with their understanding of regulatory responsibilities and as their knowledge increases, so does their concern that their internal processes may need to be more robust.

It is true to say that financial crime compliance affects every industry, but some sectors will be more highly exposed to potential violations because of the countries in which they operate, others because of the individuals or institutions with whom they do business.

Airlines, logistics, oil exploration and pharmaceuticals have been relatively proactive in managing their risk, while those companies that operate predominantly in perceived risky jurisdictions have likely been sensitised to the importance of compliance.

There are a number of ways in which corporates can address the issue of regulatory compliance:

#1 Screening financial transactions is a very effective way to mitigate the risk of sanctions violations. This has the added benefit that corporations not only assure themselves that the transaction is compliant, but they can avoid payment blockages where a query on a single transaction could hold up all the remaining payments in a batch. Corporate treasury departments can expedite payments and improve straight-through processing.

#2 Screening customers and suppliers during the on-boarding process is vital, ongoing screening is essential. Checks are made against lists issued by various bodies (including OFAC) to ensure that the countries, companies or individuals with whom they deal are not subject to sanctions.

#3 Sanctions list management is recognised as a challenging task. The lists change regularly, sometimes daily, with names of entities and individuals being added and subtracted. As such, customer and supplier databases would need to be screened regularly to maintain ongoing compliance. Diligence is mandatory, as the job of managing sanctions lists and updating sanctions filters is both complex and time consuming.

#4 Beyond your borders. Although it may be obvious it is worth considering the example that companies operating in the US must comply with US regulations in their everyday business activities, it may not have been as clear that this obligation also extends to organisations outside of the US that are buying US goods, trading in US dollars or have US staff on their payroll who are involved in payment processing.

The onus is on the corporate to be compliant and it must be a high priority to implement effective controls.

Creating a framework for the future

Fighting financial crime remains a high priority for regulators and governments across the world. Regulators and policy makers, although initially focused on the financial industry, are now widening their net to include the broader corporate community.

Corporates can learn from the financial industry and incorporate financial crime compliance into the day-to-day management of their business.

Regulatory compliance costs are going to increase as businesses expand into new countries and every effort has to be made to identify how regulations may affect their business. Implementing practical steps to ensure their compliance is fit for purpose will not only protect reputation and avoid fines; it will ensure their business can prosper as it expands to new territories.

3,"WASHINGTON (AP) â An American security contractor is accusing two top-ranking Congolese officials of ordering his detention and torture, declaring in a lawsuit that they demanded he confess falsely to being part of a plot to overthrow the countryâs government.

Darryl Lewis, an Air Force veteran, said in an Associated Press interview this week that he was illegally held in Congoâs capital, Kinshasa, for nearly six weeks and interrogated for as much as 16 hours a day by members of Congoâs national intelligence agency.

Congoâs intelligence chief, Kalev Mutond, and Congolese Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, âacted in concertâ to have him detained, tortured and âthreatened with indefinite imprisonment on false charges,â according to the lawsuit, filed July 29 in federal court in Washington.

âI feared for my life from the day they captured me,â Lewis, 48, said. He said he never confessed.

Congoâs ambassador, Francois Balumuene, said in a statement Thursday that Lewis was detained because he did not have the proper work permit. He denied Lewis had been mistreated and called his lawsuit âunsubstantiated allegations.â

Law enforcement authorities in Congo released Lewis on June 8 after âextensive diplomatic efforts and negotiations,â the lawsuit said. Lewis is seeking at least $4.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

The lawsuit comes amid mounting tensions ahead of November presidential elections in Congo. Opposition leaders claim that President Joseph Kabila wants to delay the vote so he can stay in power past his mandate that expires at the end of the year. The countryâs constitution bars Kabila from running for a third term.

Congoâs relations with Washington have frayed over the last year due to repeated reports that Kabilaâs government has cracked down on political foes and activists. The U.S. Treasury Department in June sanctioned a top Congolese police official who activists say is linked to dozens of deaths. The departmentâs statement announcing the sanctions against Celestin Kanyama noted a âpattern of repressionâ by Kabilaâs government.

Lewis had been working as an unarmed security adviser for Moise Katumbi, Congoâs leading opposition candidate for president. Katumbi, one of Kabilaâs harshest critics, has been charged separately by authorities in Congo with hiring mercenaries. Katumbi and his supporters have denied the allegation and say the move is aimed at derailing his bid for the presidency.

In the lawsuit, Mwamba is described as being convinced that Lewis and hundreds of other U.S. citizens had infiltrated Congo since last October to help Katumbi overthrow the government and assassinate Kabila. Lewisâ military background made him especially suspect. At a May 4 press conference, Mwamba displayed as evidence a photo of Lewis holding a large machine gun.

Lewis said the photo was taken in 2009 when he was working as a contractor in Kosovo. Congolese authorities must have pulled it from his LinkedIn account, he said. The photo has since been replaced with another of Lewis.

Mwamba declined to comment on the specifics of Lewisâ lawsuit. âA Congolese who would be found to have acted in the U.S. as Lewis did in the (Congo) surely would have to explain himself before the FBI and other authorities,â he said.

The lawsuit said Lewis and three colleagues were âstopped and surroundedâ by Congolese riot police on April 24 as they were driving near a political rally that Katumbi had attended in the city of Lubumbashi. They were unarmed and breaking no laws, according to Lewis. He was the only American in the group.

Soon, several members of Congoâs intelligence agency, who were not named in the suit, arrived. They handcuffed and physically assaulted Lewis and his colleagues. At one point, a car door was slammed into his elbow, the lawsuit said.

Lewis said they were taken to a âfilthy, unsanitaryâ jail in Lubumbashi and put in separate cells. He was assaulted and abused, according to the lawsuit. His bound hands were pulled up behind his back, creating painful pressure on his shoulder joints. During the night, Lewis could hear his captors âbrutally beatâ and interrogate one of his colleagues. âYouâre next,â Lewis said he was warned.

The next day Lewis was transported to the intelligence agencyâs headquarters in Kinshasa. Over the next six weeks, he was questioned for long periods and deprived of sleep, according to the lawsuit. His captors gave him just one small meal a day. Lewis said his captors also began a series of âmind games,â such as using information about his ailing mother, to wear him down and secure a confession.

Lewis was not charged with a crime before he was released.",1

He is believed to have been the operations chief for the shadowy militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and has been named as a key suspect in a string of bombings across the region.

The Islamic scholar, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, is wanted by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines in connection with a series of bomb attacks.

He is also accused of arranging a meeting between two of the 11 September hijackers with other al-Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000, and of being behind other plots to blow up Western targets in the region.

And he is further accused of connections with the suspects accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.

He has faced lengthy interrogation by the US following his arrest, in central Thailand in 2003. He has now been sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

JI is blamed for several attacks across South East Asia, including the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 attack on the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, which killed 12.

Analysts say JI wants to establish an Islamic state across Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and parts of the Philippines.

Indonesia's civilian intelligence service has linked Hambali specifically with the 2002 Bali attack.

He is thought to have been the major brains behind the operation, as well as the financial conduit.

Indonesia's Defence Minister, Matori Abdul Djalil, has said that Hambali was deputy to Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, JI's alleged leader.

Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was jailed in 2005 after he was found guilty of conspiracy in connection with the 2002 Bali attacks. He denies any links with JI.

Radical roots

Hambali was born in West Java in 1966, one of 13 children in a poor family.

As a teenager he became involved in a network of local groups known broadly as Jemaah Islamiah, which literally translates as ""Islamic community"". One of the men allegedly running the network was Abu Bakar Ba'asyir.

Hambali became involved in radical Islam as a reaction against the religious repression of the Suharto regime throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1985, when Hambali was aged 19, he sought exile in Malaysia, along with Mr Ba'asyir and other followers.

From there he travelled to Afghanistan in 1988 to fight as a Mujahideen guerrilla against Soviet occupation.

He returned to Malaysia in 1990, where he is believed to have travelled the country recruiting young Muslims to join a jihad (holy war) with the eventual aim of setting up a pan-Asian Islamic state.

Back in Indonesia, Suharto was overthrown in 1998, and Hambali is believed to have returned there in October 2000 to recruit more supporters.

On Christmas Eve that year, a series of bombs exploded almost simultaneously in nine Indonesian cities, many of them in churches. Eighteen people were killed.

A series of suspects have named Hambali - who returned to Malaysia a few days before the attacks - as the mastermind for the bombings.

A few days after the Indonesian bombs, 22 people were killed in a series of simultaneous bombs in the Philippine capital Manila. Philippine police say they have evidence that Hambali funded the attacks.

Philippine prosecutors have charged Hambali in absentia with involvement in a plot to smuggle explosives from the Philippines to Singapore in 2000, for an attack on US and Israeli targets, which was foiled.",1
482,"WASHINGTON--()--The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has expelled New York-based Halcyon Cabot Partners, Ltd., and barred Chief Executive Officer Michael Morris and Chief Compliance Officer Ronald Heineman from the securities industry, for fraud, sales practice abuses, and widespread supervisory and anti-money laundering failures. FINRA found that Halcyon, Morris and Heineman engaged in a scheme to conceal a kickback of private placement fees.

FINRAs investigation found that Halcyon, Morris and Heineman, along with a previously barred registered representative, Craig Josephberg, agreed to conceal the discount the issuer provided to a venture capital firm when it purchased a private placement in a cancer drug development company. The scheme was effected through a bogus placement fee agreement that was entered into after the venture capital firm had already agreed to purchase the entirety of the offerings. Halcyon did not perform any work, as there was already a buyer in place, but rather returned almost all of its $1.75 million placement fee to the investor through sham consulting agreements. This fraudulent scheme allowed the drug company to conceal that it was selling its shares at a discount.

Brad Bennett, FINRAs Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, ""This sham placement arrangement allowed the investor to conceal the kickback of the placement fee and thus deceive the market into believing that the shares were being sold at the full offering price. These actions were consistent with the culture of non-compliance fostered by Halcyon and its principals, which manifested itself in widespread sales practice abuses and AML violations that are also detailed in this case.

In addition to the kickback scheme, FINRA also found that Halcyon and Morris enabled a now-expelled broker-dealer, Felix Investments, LLC, to collect undisclosed commissions. Pursuant to an agreement between Halcyon and Felix, Felix charged buyer commissions and Halcyon charged seller commissions on a transaction, despite the fact Halcyon did not provide any services to the sellers. Halcyon then secretly shared the sellers commissions with Felix.

FINRA also found that Morris falsified Halcyons books and records to conceal Josephbergs sales of securities in states where he was not registered, including Florida, Texas and Colorado. Halcyon also failed to supervise Josephberg, who churned retail customer accounts and effected unauthorized trades.

In concluding this settlement, Halcyon Cabot Partners, Morris and Heineman neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

FINRAs investigation was conducted by the Departments of Enforcement and Member Regulation.

1001,"Above: Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein in spotlight surrounded by reporters at news conference on Maryland Health Exchange.

This is slightly edited version of a column that appears in the August edition of The Business Monthly serving Howard and Anne Arundel counties.

By Len Lazarick

Len@MarylandReporter.com

It was easy to feel sorry for state Secretary of Health & Mental Hygiene Joshua Sharfstein during the last couple of years. When it was announced he was leaving the department late last month, the only surprise was that his departure wasnt immediate and that it hadnt happened sooner.

Instead, Sharfstein will hang on to the very end of the OMalley administration, before he moves on to The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said he wanted to oversee the implementation of the revamped Maryland Health Care Exchange that was such a flop last year.

Sharfstein seemed a likely person to blame in that debacle  after the head of the exchange was fired. Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was ostensibly in charge of the exchange, but internal documents revealed that he didnt know much about what was going on.

Sharfstein was the cabinet secretary actually in charge, and if he wasnt paying close enough attention as the contractors missed deadlines and squabbled, he was certainly paying attention after thousands of Marylanders couldnt sign up for health insurance.

Too much Dysfunction

Sharfstein already had too much dysfunction begging for attention at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department with that rather antiquated name has the largest single budget in the state; this fiscal year, the department is due to spend $11.4 billion, nearly a third of the total state budget, with half of it in federal money tied mostly to Medicaid for the poor and disabled.

Sharfstein, a Harvard-trained physician, is bright and incredibly diligent, but that was not always good enough to steer an agency that has too much on its plate. It has a dozen major agencies under its umbrella, and several of those agencies have chronic serious problems that the legislatures auditors and budget analysts have pointed out time and again.

The well-documented problems with the Maryland Health Exchange were perhaps the most immediately visible and controversial. Not only didnt the website work, but the state may have failed to properly oversee the vendors. And the board overseeing it violated the Open Meetings Law when it was deciding what to do about it.

Assisted living audits lacking

In June, an audit found that the departments Office of Health Care Quality has failed to fix many of the problems highlighted in at least three previous audits dating back at least to 2004. There are more than 1,300 licensed assisted living facilities in Maryland caring for thousands of residents who are not quite able to care for themselves; but year after year during the past decade, the state health department has failed to do required annual inspections for a majority of them.

The department said it was trying to fix the problems that also extend to thousands of other health care facilities, nursing homes and the like. One solution is to stop trying to do annual visits of every facility, but only focus on the ones with clear problems.

In July, the Baltimore Suns investigative unit uncovered a case where a severely disabled child died in a group apartment in the Russett section of Laurel in Anne Arundel County.

It turned out that the nonprofit operator of the group home had been in bankruptcy. The state had not been told and the operator did not have enough money to cover the required staffing for these children and adults with multiple and severe disabilities. The operation was stopped, and the children were moved.

Unspent money for disabilities

The Developmental Disabilities Administration is one of the larger units in the health department, assisting 27,000 patients. Its caregivers manage a wide range of disabilities, from mild to severe. The DDA has thousands of people waiting for services, but three years ago, it was discovered that the agency had left more than $35 million of an $830 million budget unspent, and had to return $25 million to the state treasury.

Part of the problem was the department was still keeping its financial records on paper and had a hard time keeping tracking of its funds. Sharfstein got heavily involved, hired a new director, had large town hall meetings with clients and caregivers to explain the situation and ultimately replaced the new director with his own chief of staff.

At one large town hall meeting late last year in Columbia, Sharfstein showed up late to hear from the hundreds who came to listen and complain. His excuse: He was working on the Maryland Health Care Exchange.

One million on Medicaid

The problems with Medicaid, the Medical Care Programs Administration, are as large as its $8.1 billion dollar budget, complicated by a rapidly growing program that now covers more than a million Marylanders. One-sixth of all state residents now get their health insurance through Medicaid, due to expanded coverage under Obamacare.

But the legacy computer system that processes the millions of claims from health care providers is old and cranky, and the process to replace it, using a special federal grant, has been long and troubled, budget analysts said. It got so bad last year, that the department needed to come up with a new development strategy.

This clunky old claims processing makes it harder and slower to uncover fraud and overbilling that goes on in such a huge program, largely perpetrated by doctors, nursing homes, therapists and drug companies.

At a hearing last year, the departments inspector general estimated that 3% to 9% of claims are overpaid, sometimes because of honest mistakes, sometimes on purpose. That totals from $240 million to $720 million a year  but the fraud unit in the attorney generals office is catching only a fraction of that amount.

Solutions not simple

Discussing these issues, Del. Guy Guzzone, D-Howard, co-chair of the Joint Audit Committee, said its tempting to think that a structural solution, like splitting up some of the health department, might cure some of its administrative ills. But while appealing, that he said wouldnt necessarily cure the deeper management problems in some of these agencies.

Those tasks will ultimately fall on Sharfsteins successor. In a few years, we might be feeling sorry for that successor if these chronic issues continue to persist, as they have through at least two governors.",0
132,"The multi-millionaire owner of the Nina Ricci fashion company was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC bank.

Arlette Ricci, 74 and one of the richest women in Europe, was âparticularly determinedâ to stash money in Swiss accounts for more than two decades.

A judgement handed down by a Paris criminal court added: âThe seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to the public good.â

Ricci had denied hiding the equivalent of more than Â£15million, saying she had simply tried to avoid tax â which is legal â rather than evade it, which is not.

However, bugged phone conversations between the heiress and her daughter, Margot Vignat, suggested otherwise. According to the transcript, Ms Ricci boasted that she changed banks to escape prosecution and spent the hidden funds on buying a chalet in an upmarket Swiss ski resort.

âI was never troubled. So I bought a chalet in Klosters, and now itâs fine. There was 2009, 2010, 2011 â itâs been three years so I think Iâm free of any type of inspection,â Ricci was heard to say.

Her daughter was heard warning her about the tax authorities, saying: 'Watch out all the same. They're vicious.'

But Ricci reassured her, saying: 'Everyone got done but not me. They had to give themselves in and pay a fortune.'

The daughter replied: 'Oh, that could cause some damage'. Ricci, in turn, said: 'Yes, of course, because all that is very illegal.'

In what will set a legal precedent for other cases of tax fraud through HSBC, Ricci was also fined the equivalent of more than Â£700,000.

Judges also ordered that houses in Paris and on the holiday island of Corsica worth more than Â£3m be seized.

Ricci was accused of transferring the deeds of the properties to family trusts in an attempt to restructure her assets, so as to evade penalties.

She was given a total of three years in prison, with two years suspended. Her daughter, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Henri-Nicolas Fleurance, Ricciâs tax adviser, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and an Â£8000 fine for attempting to organise her insolvency.

Jean-Marc Fedida, one of the defence barristers, said 'justice was done under frenetic, brutal pressure', so as to use a high-profile defendant as a 'warning to all those' with offshore accounts.

But he conceded the sentence was 'much lighter' that what the prosecution had asked for.

Ricci, who had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, may ask if she can serve the prison term under less strict conditions, including wearing an electronic tag, her lawyers said.

Her lawyers always argued the fault lay with HSBC in Switzerland, with one insisting in defence documents: 'She was in no way informed about how HSBC decided to structure the organisation of the funds she entrusted it with.'

They added that they were considering an appeal against sentence. Ricci was the first of more than 50 high-profile French nationals being pursued in the courts for using Swiss accounts to hide their money.

The judgment came after HSBC Holdings was formally placed under criminal investigation for complicity in fiscal fraud and illegal selling via its Swiss arm for two years starting in 2006.

Nina Ricci â real name Maria Adelaide Nielli â was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970.

Her son Robert, Arlette Ricciâs father, developed the companyâs perfume sideline and raised the firmâs international profile. Arlette Ricci inherited his fortune on his death in 1988.",1
136,"[twitter-follow username=âlancegumaâ scheme=âdarkâ]

A comprehensive dossier exposes Zanu PF Shamva North MP, Nicholas Tasunungurwa Goche, as having led violent and murderous campaigns in his constituency that led to the deaths of dozens of opposition activists and serious injury to hundreds.

The transport ministerâs trail of brutality âstretches as far back as the 2000 parliamentary elections when scores of perceived opposition activists were butchered in and around the Shamva Gold mine areas.â Goche and his gangs used so-called âpungweâ (re-education) sessions to carry out these attacks.

After MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the March 2008 presidential election the Joint Operations Command (JOC), a grouping of all the state security agencies, responded with the brutal Operation Mavhotera Papi (where did you vote).

The figures are hard to confirm but its estimated nearly 500 perceived MDC-T supporters were killed, while tens of thousands were tortured and maimed. Goche meanwhile was busy playing his part in Shamva.

On the 11th May 2008 his mob descended on Elias Kahari Madzivanziraâs homestead. âThey accused the family of being MDC supporters and they started randomly beating up everyone in sight and destroying whatever they could lay their hands on,â witness statements in the dossier say.

Elias was struck on the head with an axe and witnesses said his head split in two and he died on the spot. His wife Erica was also beaten up but survived. The perpetrators are well known in the local resettlement area and were seen in the company of Goche during the day, drinking beer and singing Mugabeâs praises.

Five days later on the 16th of May Goche addressed a campaign meeting at Chidembo School in the morning where he instructed all youths in the area to âguard their land jealouslyâ against what he called âthe whites re-invasion.â He told them to wipe out all MDC supporters in the area.

In his speech that day Goche mentioned Edson Zaya as a âknown sell out in the areaâ and the mob captured him at Chidembo Shopping centre in Shamva. Zaya was heavily assaulted for more than an hour and was badly injured. He died shortly after the assault on the same day.

On the 27th of May Gocheâs gang of ZANU PF youths dragged Kidwell Zvavamwe from his bed during the night. They assaulted him badly and he died from the injuries a week later. Kidwellâs wife Lucia Mukaru said that the youths barred her husband from seeking medical help.

In other incidents the youths;

âDragged Roy Barwa from his hut with a wire tied around his neck like a leash and his face covered with a red cloth, which they said represented death. They destroyed his homestead burning all what was inside the huts. His entire family was assaulted, including the children and the mother.â

The mob was also responsible for the abduction of Florence Muponya from her home. They also beat up her husband before burning all the huts, kraals and a car. Showing the impunity with which Goche and his gang operated, the incident was reported to the police but Goche ordered the police to arrest his victims instead.

Muponya and her family were made to face political violence charges before the court in Bindura. The charges were subsequently thrown out.

It is remarkable given this background that Goche is one of ZANU PFâs key negotiators of the Global Political agreement (GPA), and in fact he was part of the team that crafted the GPA that shaped the coalition government.

In March this year, Goche was in the news when High Court Judge, Justice Charles Hungwe granted the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission permission to search his ministerial offices and those of Mines minister Obert Mpofu and Indigenisation minister Saviour Kasukuwere.

The commission also pounced on the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board (NIEEB) and Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) offices which fall under Kasukuwere and Goche respectively. It was only Justice George Chiweshe who blocked the searches.

Chiweshe is a key Mugabe ally who as past chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission withheld presidential election results for weeks in March 2008, amid reports the period was used to manipulate and massage the figures that denied Morgan Tsvangirai an outright victory over a shocked Mugabe.",1
693,"Eight months after suffering a data breach the Bank of Montreal says it is integrating its cybersecurity, fraud, and physical security capabilities into a new financial crimes unit.

The unit will be headed by Larry Zelvin, former managing director and global head of cyber security at U.S.-based financial giant Citigroup Inc. Before that he was director of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and senior director for response at the U.S. National Security Council.

He joins the bank Jan. 14.

The unit, which will work with BMOâs anti-money laundering department, will leverage a fusion center model. According to the Booze Allen Hamilton consulting firm, fusion centres bring together disparate groups within an organization to boost intelligence, enhance response speed, reduce costs, and leverage scarce talent. âAs a result, companies realize faster and more efficient threat awareness and mitigation before, during, and following a cyber breach,â it says.

According to the Globe and Mail, the new financial crimes unit will have a staff of nearly 700.

âGiven a growing reliance on advanced digital technologies, the financial services industry is faced with more sophisticated financial crime activities that often exploit misaligned fraud and cyber security practices,â Darryl White, BMOâs chief executive said in a statement. âIt is critical that we continue to invest, and develop our talent and processes to protect information of our customers, the bank and our partners.â

In May, 2018 the Bank of Montreal and CIBCâs Simplii Financial online bank began investigating apparent breaches of customer information, each apparently involving tens of thousands of customers. At the time BMO issued a statement saying âfraudstersâ had told the bank they had some personal and financial information of âa limited number of customers.â

Steve Tennyson, BMOâs chief technology officer, told the Globe and Mail the bank learned lessons from that breach. Attackers are more sophisticated than ever, he said, including using automated bots.",0
104,"The Serious Fraud Office has charged three men in connection with the collapse of an investment fund.

Timothy Schools, David Kennedy and Richard Emmett are facing different charges ranging from fraud to transferring criminal property.

The SFO said the trio had diverted money from the Axiom Legal Financing Fund for their own benefit.

It said in a statement: âThe Serious Fraud Office has charged three men with multiple offences in connection with its investigation into the collapse of the Axiom Legal Financing Fund.

âTimothy Schools, David Kennedy and Richard Emmett are charged with carrying out a fraudulent scheme to divert money from the Axiom Legal Financing Fund for their own benefit.â

Schools, a 59-year-old former solicitor, has been charged with three counts of fraudulent trading, one count of fraud and one count of transferring criminal property.

Kennedy, 67, is charged with one count of fraudulent trading, while Emmett, 47, faces one count of fraudulent trading, and another of being concerned in an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another.

The charges follow a three-year investigation by the SFO into the case.

The SFO said it was unable to comment further as the cases are now live criminal proceedings.

The menâs lawyers have been contacted.

The case is listed for September 30 at Westminster Magistratesâ Court.",1
673,"The founder and CEO of the London-based banking startup, Nik Storonsky denied allegations of negligence relating to the companyâs anti-money laundering (AML) software. The Revolut money-laundering investigation has been on the spotlight after that.

The article was updated on 31 December, 2019 by Amicus.

06 March, 2019 | AtoZ Markets â A British newspaper has published a report on February 28 alleging that it had seen documents. Those were proving that the executives of the digital bank Revolut had deliberately switched off an automated system. It is designed to prevent suspicious transactions for a three-month period in 2018.

The newspaper said thousands of illegal transactions might have been processed through the Revolutâs digital banking system between July and September last year. This reportedly has attracted the attention of the UKâs Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). And it led to the resignation of Peter Higgins, the CFO of Revolut who had worked at JPMorgan for more than 12 years.

REVOLUT CEO Denies Money Laundering Claims

CEO Nik Storonsky has stated that thereâs been some misleading information in the media relating to [the startupâs]compliance function. According to him, Revolut had opted to revert to its previous AML systems after an upgrade failed to produce adequate security.

He continued by saying this action did not result in a breach of sanctions or AML regulations. It meant that the company did not see fit to send a formal notification to the regulator. Storonsky added:

âAt no point during this time did we fail to meet our legal or regulatory requirements. We conducted a thorough review of all transactions that were processed during this time, which confirmed that there were no breaches.â

REVOLUT Money Laundering Investigation

At the moment, the fintech firm is the subject of investigation in the United Kingdom and Lithuania. Police in the UK have launched an official fraud investigation over a complaint on a money transfer by the digital bank. That adds further pressure to the fintech company. It is already facing investigations on other issues from the financial regulators.

The City of London Police confirmed this on the tweet. An investigation, led by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, instigated after the Metropolitan Police received a complaint about the company in early February.

In Lithuania, the digital banking startup received a European banking licence last year. The firm has also come under the microscope over concerns relating to politicians funding. An initial investigation upon application for a licence is common practice. However, Revolut subjected to a second probing, as lawmakers worried about the source of some stakeholdersâ money.

REVOLUTâs Internal Culture Under Fire

Meanwhile, the companyâs internal culture has also come under attack as a report has emerged that further taints the startup. According to Wired, the successful company, valued at $1.7 billion, has come at a huge cost to its staff.

Former employees have described a toxic environment of unpaid work, high staff turnover and no work-life balance. It also claims that the staff compelled to carry out unpaid tasks and given unachievable targets.

The CEO said on the companyâs Slack channel in 2018 that senior staff were not working on weekends to hit targets. And he also affirmed those team members with performance ratings significantly below expectations. That would dismiss without negotiations in a subsequent review.

In a recent Tweet, Storonsky said that the companyâs internal working culture had evolved as fast as our business. He added that it had spent a lot of time working on its culture over the past 18 months.

We've made mistakes in the past, but we are not the same company that we were 18 months ago. We're not perfect, but we definitely want to be. https://t.co/MIyPirrntO

910,"Why is the Commission proposing a Directive on the criminalisation of money laundering?

Terrorist organisations and organised crime need financing  to maintain their criminal networks, to recruit and supply, and to commit terrorist acts themselves. Money laundering allows criminal organisations to benefit from their illegal activities and maintain their operations. In essence, money laundering uses the earnings generated through a multitude of illegal cross-border activities  such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illicit arms trafficking and corruption  to acquire, convert or transfer property, while hiding the true nature of its origin, in order to use the revenues of these crimes in the legitimate economy. A strengthened criminal response to money laundering contributes to cutting off sources of finance and countering the financial incentives which drive crime, making a powerful contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime.

The current criminal law framework against money laundering in the EU is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently coherent to be fully effective. All Member States criminalise money laundering; however, existing differences in the definition, scope and sanctions of money laundering offences affect cross-border police and judicial cooperation between national authorities as well as the exchange of information. These differences in legal frameworks can also be exploited by criminals and terrorists, who could carry out financial transactions where they perceive anti-money laundering measures to be weakest.

In February 2016, the Commission set out an Action Plan to ensure that Member States have the necessary tools at their disposal to address new threats linked to terrorist financing. The Action Plan recognised that while Member States have criminalised money laundering, there are differences across the EU as to the definition of money laundering and the sanctions applied. To that end the Commission committed to propose a Directive harmonising money laundering offenses and sanctions by the end of 2016.

The measures proposed today will provide for a strengthened legal framework to combat money laundering in the European Union, improve enforcement in this area and reduce the threat from terrorist and organised crime organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities. They will further reinforce the EU's capacity to tackle organised crime and terrorist financing more effectively and more generally enhance the internal security of the EU and the safety of EU citizens.

What are the key objectives of the Directive?

Today's proposal for a Directive aims at tackling money laundering by means of criminal law. It proposes to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering, as well as common provisions to improve the investigation of those offences and to ensure better cooperation in the fight against money laundering.

The Directive aims at implementing international obligations on money laundering and terrorist financing such as the Warsaw Convention and relevant recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

In addition, the proposal will improve cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between competent authorities. All Member States have criminalised money laundering, but there are differences between Member States both on the definition of money laundering and on the sanctions applied to such a crime. These differences create obstacles that hinder cross-border judicial and police cooperation to effectively tackle money laundering. The Directive aims to remove these obstacles by setting up a common definition of money laundering across the EU.

Finally, the measures will help to prevent criminals from exploiting the differences between national legislations to their advantage. A situation where there are widely differing sanctions for money laundering across the EU creates a risk of ""forum shopping"" by offenders, or in other words  criminals choosing to carry out their crimes where they are less likely to face serious sanctions.

What is the scale of the money laundering problem?

The United Nations estimated the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 at approximately USD 2.1 trillion, which is equivalent to 3.6% of global GDP. The amount of money generated from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the EU has been estimated at 110 billion per year, corresponding to 1% of the EU GDP. For criminals to benefit fully from the proceeds of their crimes, these criminal proceeds need to be laundered.

Criminal investigations on money laundering involving several EU Member States are very frequent. As part of the Commissions consultation process, estimates in one Member State suggest that between 10 to 15% of cases have a cross border dimension. In two Member States the same estimate is 20%, and in a couple of Member States it reaches 70%. Five Member States estimate that the proportion of money laundering investigations with a cross-border element ranges between 38% and 50%.

Eurojust registered 724 cases on money laundering between 2012 and July 2015, rising from 193 cases in 2013 to 286 money laundering cases in 2015. Furthermore, a large number of Member States have estimated the number of Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) with a cross-border dimension to be between 30% and 50%. The number of requests for information and cooperation transmitted through FIU.Net, the information exchange tool of EU Financial Intelligence Units, increased from 12,076 in 2014 to 17,149 in 2015.

What are the links between money laundering and terrorist financing?

Large terrorist groups as well as smaller cells and individuals often finance their attacks and activities through crime. Organised crime can support terrorism, for example through the supply of illegal weapons. Terrorists can use money laundering schemes to convert, conceal or acquire the proceeds of criminal activities.

A strengthened EU legal framework to criminalise money laundering would both help to combat organised crime and contribute to tackling terrorist financing more effectively and reduce the threat from terrorist organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities.

This Directive will also complement the Directive on combating terrorism, which sets a comprehensive definition of the crime of terrorist financing, covering not only terrorist offences but also terrorist-related offences such as recruitment, training and propaganda.

How does this proposal fit in the overall EU framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing?

This proposal is an integral part of the EU response to money laundering and complements measures in place aimed at detecting, disrupting and preventing the abuse of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, notably the revised 4 th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Transfer of Funds Regulation. While these measures help to prevent money laundering and facilitate investigations into money laundering offences, they do not address the absence of a uniform definition of money laundering.

The proposal also reinforces the criminal law framework with regard to offences relating to terrorist groups and the criminalisation of terrorism financing, as included in the proposal for a Directive on combating terrorism.

Will the Directive ensure that the EU is compliant with international standards?

This proposal aims to implement international requirements on the criminalisation of money laundering. The Directive will move the EU closer to meeting its international obligations in this area, such as those set out in the Council of Europe Warsaw Convention, as well as Financial Action Task Force recommendations.

Recommendation 3 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) calls on countries to criminalise money laundering on the basis of the UN Vienna Convention of 1988 and the UN Palermo Convention of 2001. It asks countries to criminalise the laundering of proceeds of all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences (see below for explanation), as well as ancillary activities unless this is not permitted by fundamental principles of domestic law.

The Warsaw Convention is the most comprehensive international convention on money laundering. It requests parties to adopt legislative measures to facilitate the prevention, investigation and prosecution of money laundering as well as the effective freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of crime.

The Warsaw Convention was signed by 26 EU Member States, of which 17 have so far ratified it. The EU signed the Warsaw Convention in 2009 but has not yet ratified it. This proposal for a Directive would be an important step towards ratification of the Warsaw Convention.

What is ""self-laundering"" and why has the Commission included it in the proposal?

Self-laundering refers to the situation where a person who has committed a crime tries to hide the illicit origins of the proceeds from that crime. Self-laundering is an additional crime, different to the predicate offence, which violates the integrity of the financial market and thus it's important to prosecute those who try and benefit from its proceeds.

As self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions, this can cause difficulties for some Member States in establishing a prosecutable offence and investigating and tracing the flow of illegally acquired funds. Eurojust indicates that the fact that self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions may cause difficulties for some Member States to establish a prosecutable offence and to investigate and trace the flow of black money.

What is a ""predicate offence""?

In money laundering cases, a predicate offence is the underlying criminal activity which generated the property laundered. An example of a predicate offence can be drug trafficking which leads to profits which may then be laundered.

The definition of predicate offences can vary from country to country.

Why is it necessary to establish a list of predicate offences?

International conventions and FATF recommendations require the inclusion of a number of offences as predicate offences for money laundering such as terrorism, including terrorist financing, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, illicit arms trafficking, environmental crime, fraud, corruption or tax crimes. However, these categories are simply listed and not defined, leaving wide scope for national differences in the range of predicate offences.

By establishing a list of predicate offences, this Directive will therefore make cross-border cooperation more effective, as well as fulfilling international requirements. All the predicate offences listed (except for cybercrime) come from the relevant international conventions which the Directive aims to implement. The references to EU law have been added only for those predicate offences where there is already an existing act at EU level requiring the criminalisation of a certain conduct.

Why did the Commission include cybercrime as predicate offence?

In the context of an increasing threat of cybercrime and attacks against information systems, the Directive also includes ""cybercrime"" in a list of offences related to terrorist financing. Computer crime is the only area of crime mentioned in Article 83 TFEU which is not listed in the categories of offences designated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Warsaw Convention. The financial impact of cybercrime and the size of related proceeds are hard to quantify, but cases show that proceeds from cybercrime are laundered through sophisticated schemes, involving both traditional and new payment methods. In order to disrupt the financial incentive that drives many cybercrime activities, the proposal qualifies cybercrime as a predicate offence for money laundering.

Does this proposal go beyond international requirements?

In certain areas, this proposal goes beyond international requirements. It establishes the minimum level of the maximum sanctions and it also criminalises ""self-laundering"" (see above for explanation).

In addition to listing general categories of crime, the list provided in this proposal includes cybercrime and crimes where there is legislation at EU level defining the predicate offences, by making a reference to the relevant EU legislative acts.

What are the next steps of the proposal?

The proposal for a Directive on countering money laundering by criminal law will now be transmitted to the European Parliament and Council for adoption, in line with the normal legislative process. Once adopted, Member States have two years to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law.

To which Member States does the proposal apply?

The proposal applies to all EU Member States except for Denmark, which is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive. The United Kingdom and Ireland can decide to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive.

973,"If you thought Googles Prediction API was just a handy tool for web programmers and weekend hackers, think again. A Folsom, Calif.-based startup called Pondera Solutions is pushing what it calls Fraud Detection as a Service, which is based on a variety of Google (s goog) services, including the Prediction API machine learning tool.

Pondera has actually been offering its service since November 2011, but this is the first Ive heard of it. I spotted it in a Wednesday-morning Google Enterprise blog post announcing that the Iowa Workforce Development agency has selected Pondera to power its unemployment-fraud detection efforts. The agencys system for analyzing unemployment claims highlights a portion of the Google services Pondera uses:

With FDaaS, suspicious claims are proactively flagged by the system, which alerts IWD employees about potentially fraudulent claims. The claims are plotted on a heatmap built on Google Maps to identify areas with the highest fraud incidents and determine where to put more investigative resources. We also use Google Street View to check the validity of businesses that submit claims.

Ponderas website lays out the rest:

Googles data centers, where FDaaS runs, which allow for immense scalability without the need to purchase on-premise hardware or software. Because FDaaS is in the cloud, unexpected spikes in UI claims can be handled without system failure or processing time lags.
Googles Prediction API, which trains, tunes and updates prediction models that check individual claims for anomalies or suspicious activities. Google prediction technologies discover and report trends, patterns, clusters, and other variables.
Google Big Query, which mines large amounts of transaction data to uncover previously undetected patterns and trends.
Google App Engine, which identifies factors such as UI claimants who have been rehired, those who may be using a fraudulent identity, and computers that have been previously used in fraudulent claims.
Google Search Appliance (GSA), which aids investigation of potential fraud or improper payments across both structured and unstructured data. Analysts and investigators can research cases using the GSAs intuitive, familiar Google search box.

Actually, this isnt the first time Googles Prediction API has been publicly cited as the basis for some real-world work. In 2011, Ford Motor Co. discussed how it was using the service to predict drivers behavior based on the data that cars sensors have captured in the past.",0
619,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Two top executives at Westpac (WBK), one of Australia's biggest banks, are out after the company was hit with extensive claims that it had systematically allowed money laundering on its watch.

The company announced Tuesday that CEO Brian Hartzer will step down in the wake of allegations that the bank had violated money laundering and terrorism financing regulations tens of millions of times. Lindsay Maxsted, who serves as chairman of the board, will also move up his retirement to the first half of next year.

Hartzer, who has been on the job since 2015, will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Peter King while the bank looks for a permanent successor.

The company came under fire last week when AUSTRAC, an Australian regulator that fights financial crime, said that Westpac failed to report more than 19.5 million instructions for transfers in and out of Australia. The regulatory watchdog also said Westpac neglected to do its due diligence on transactions to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia ""that have known financial indicators relating to potential child exploitation.""

The agency alleges that Westpac broke the law more than 23 million times, each time in theory""attracting a civil penalty"" of between 17 million and 21 million Australian dollars. That could potentially saddle Westpac with a fine that far surpasses the 700 million Australian dollars ($474 million) levied last year on Commonwealth Bank of Australia after that bank admitted it failed to observe laws to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism.

In a statement Sunday, Maxsted said Westpac was working through its response to the allegations, and was determined to urgently fix the issues raised by the regulator. He added that the bank would commence an independent review.

Many of the allegations centered on how Westpac failed to detect money laundering or risky payments that AUSTRAC said were indicative of child exploitation. One of the alleged offenses listed in a court filing concerned LitePay, the bank's digital payments service that allows customers to make transfers of small amounts to users outside Australia.

Officials claim in the filing that Westpac has been aware of the connection between child exploitation and ""frequent low value payments"" sent to the Philippines and Southeast Asia ""since at least 2013."" And Westpac's senior management was ""specifically briefed"" on how Litepay could be at risk for such abuse in 2016, according to the filing.

The filing also claimed that Westpac failed to roll out a plan to detect some suspicious activity on LitePay until June 2018, and has yet to put in place such ""automated detection scenarios"" across other international payment systems.

Some of the undetected transactions involved payments to ""alleged or suspected child exploitation facilitators,"" according to the filing. In one case, a customer opened Westpac accounts after serving a sentence for ""child exploitation"" offenses, AUSTRAC added.

Westpac responded to AUSTRAC's filing with a proposed plan last week. The bank said it would undertake investments to reduce the risk of financial crime and roll out ""immediate fixes,"" such as shutting down LitePay.

""The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,"" the company said last week.

That did little to ease pressure on its executives. On Tuesday, Westpac said it would shake up its leadership ""in the wake of"" the allegations, and ""urgently fix"" the issues that were outlined by regulators. In addition to the two departures, a longtime board member announced he would not seek re-election.

""As CEO I accept that I am ultimately accountable for everything that happens at the bank,"" Hartzer said in a Westpac statement. ""And it is clear that we have fallen well short of what the community expects of us, and we expect of ourselves.""

Maxsted said in the statement that the board accepted ""the gravity of the issues raised by AUSTRAC.""

""It became clear that Board and management changes were in the best interest of the Bank,"" he said.

The bank is the latest to come under fire in Australia's financial sector, which has been rocked by scandals in recent months.

Last year, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBAUF) admitted that it had for years knowingly charged dead clients for advice. Two months later, the company was hit by the anti-money laundering fine.

Also in 2018, AMP  Australia's top wealth management firm  lost its chairwoman after claims surfaced that the firm had regularly overcharged its customers.

AMP said at the time that it took the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and was taking appropriate steps to address them. Its general counsel also left the firm, and the company said it would cut remuneration for its board directors by 25% for the rest of 2018.",1
365,"A Chinese national whose Instagram page features pictures of him wearing a VIP pass at a 2018 rally for President Donald Trump, is now on U.S. soil after being charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine and laundering the illicit funds, according to court documents filed earlier this week.

Tao Liu, whose alias is Antony Liu, is in the custody of the Alexandria (Virginia) Sheriffs Office, where he will be held pending his initial appearance likely sometime next week.

Liu is one of six Chinese nationals charged in a conspiracy that allegedly netted at least $30 million from 2008 to late last month and involved funneling illicit drug money to Latin American traffickers, the indictment says.

Federal prosecutors allege that the men, in part, laundered their drug proceeds by purchasing products in the U.S. and shipping them to China. The products were then sold through black market merchants in China, the indictment says, with the money sent back to drug traffickers in Latin America, often Mexicans, through Chinese currency.

The effort, the indictment says, required special care and skill in money laundering.

Liu was also charged with trying to bribe two men, who turned out to be undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents, in order to get fraudulent passports.

An Instagram page belonging to Liu features several photos of him at a September 2018 Trump rally in Wheeler, W.Va.

The Instagram page includes numerous photos from the rally as well as an image of a red USA hat with a signature that appears to be the presidents.

Thanks for the gift from Mr. President Trump, reads a post that accompanies the photo.

NBC News found no records indicating that Liu donated to the Trump campaign and it would be illegal for Liu, as a foreign national, to donate money to a political campaign.

Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment.

Liu, who was taken into custody in Alexandria, Va., could not be reached. It was not immediately clear if he had hired a lawyer.

The other five men were identified in court documents as Xizhi Li, Jianxing Chen, Jingyan Li, Eric Yong Woo, Jiayu Chen. The men were all born in China but now reside in New York, California and several Latin American countries, according to the indictment.

Federal prosecutors allege that Xizhi Li, who went by the aliases Juan Lee and had a WeChat name of JL 007 and SUPERKING 99, developed close ties with drug traffickers and cartels in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, and elsewhere to obtain contracts to move drug proceeds for the dealers.

The other five men are accused of working with Xizhi Li to help launder the drug money in a scheme that began in 2008 and lasted up until late last month, the indictment says.

Xizhi Li allegedly had bank accounts with BBVA Compass in Miami, Florida, which he used as part of the conspiracy.

In a 2019 DEA seizure application for BBVA accounts in Tennessee, investigators told the court that in the course of investigating a local drug gang they determined that the cocaine in the greater Memphis area was being supplied by the Sinaola cartel and the money laundering efforts for those transactions were allegedly directed by Xizhi Li.

BBVA Compass declined to comment.

The indictment also says Xizhi Li owned and operated a casino in Guatemala City, Guatemala, which he used to launder money and provided him a place to meet drug traffickers.

Liu is accused of trying to fraudulently obtain passports for multiple people in April. He allegedly struck a deal with undercover agents who told him they knew someone at the State Department who could illegally provide passports at a cost of $150,000 each.

The indictment says that Liu agreed to deposit about $5,000 in cryptocurrency and $5,000 in cash into what turned out to be a DEA-controlled account in order to start the process of getting the passports.

Liu was also hit with a separate money laundering charge for allegedly moving some of the funds for the bribes through cryptocurrency.

He attended several events in New York City and the surrounding area with Trump associate Joe Cinque, according to press reports and social media posts. Cinque presented him with an award when Liu held a kickoff for his investment company called Blue Water Capital. Little about Blue Water Capital, purportedly located at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, is known publicly.

A website for the firm is now defunct. There is no listing at 1 Rockefeller Plaza for Lius company and at least one firm that Liu touted as a business connection in a company video says theyve never heard of the man.",1
955,"When people in developing countries dont have access to a bank account, physical proximity to a bank is usually the first challenge that springs to mind, but sometimes the reason a person is unable to access a secure place to store their savings is as simple as them not having a piece of paper to prove who they are.

Banking regulations vary between countries, and some allow banks to set their own rules about what proof of identity they accept for new customers to make sure no one is excluded. In South Africa Standard Bank accepts a letter verifying a persons address from a tribal chief for certain accounts, while Postbank offers a Mzansi account, which does not require any proof of address but only offers basic transactional services and has a balance limit of 25,000 South African Rand (£1,362).

However, international banking standards set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Taskforce recommend that people opening an account provide specific documents. These know your customer (KYC) guidelines are not new, and have prevented poorer communities from accessing bank accounts for years. But there is increasing concern that KYC is becoming more restrictive, making access to finance harder for local banks and populations and damaging developing economies opportunity to grow.

KYC requires banks to check that potential customers are not involved in money laundering or terrorism by providing a verified proof of identity and address when opening an account. This is difficult for people living in informal housing or rural areas, who rarely have utility bills or lease agreements as proof.

Richard Ketley, director of international economics consultancy firm Genesis Analytics, says although South Africa allows its banks to offer simple accounts without proof of address, some banks have ceased offering them because they were unprofitable. He says the South African government has also failed to address the needs of migrant communities, who do not have identification documents. Not having a bank account means people risk losing their savings and makes them targets for criminals.

In many lower-income markets research shows poor people are enormously exposed to loss of savings through theft, he says. They keep money under the bed, get robbed, the house burns down, or they bury money and someone else digs it up.

Instead of loosening KYC criteria to improve financial inclusion, however, banks are tightening implementation more than ever before. Three years ago, partly in response to the global financial crisis, the Financial Action Taskforce recommended that countries toughen sanctions against banks that fail to deliver on anti money-laundering and terrorism checks. In August 2014, Standard Chartered had to pay $300m to the New York State Department of Financial Services after its screening systems failed to spot suspicious transactions in UAE. As a result, the bank closed thousands of accounts with small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the country.

Closing such international accounts, known as derisking, hurts developing countries because without relationships with big international banks, accessing finance for importing and exporting goods and transferring money abroad becomes harder and more expensive. Roy Melnick, an associate director working on money laundering for PwC South Africa, says the global standards for safeguarding are there for good reasons, but derisking disproportionately affects innocent people. Probably 99.9% of the population is law-abiding, its that 0.1% that make it so much more difficult for the rest, he says.

Banks have become particularly cautious of money transfer services such as Western Union, which are perceived as particularly open to abuse. Somalia has no formal banking service, so when Barclays Bank tried to close its Somali MSB services in 2013, removing the only money transfer service available in the country, it faced outcry. The issue was taken to the high court, which ruled Barclaysmust continue its Somali banking services. The example illustrates how vulnerable some countries are.

The cost of meeting regulations is another reason banks are increasingly closing international relationships. Banks have to prove annually they have sufficient money laundering and terrorism prevention procedures in place for every bank with which they connect. According to KYC Exchange Net AG managing director Joachim von Hänisch, this can cost the bank £10,000 for each reporting process. The bank running the checks also incurs expenses. If a bank isnt making enough money from a relationship with another bank then its simply not worthwhile, he says. Banks see derisking as a simpler solution.

Hänischs company addresses the problem by encouraging banks to use a standard, online reporting platform, KEN, that enables local banks to produce a single report a year. Three international banks have already signed up to the system since it launched in January 2014. Hänisch says it saves banks time and money, and could dissuade them from closing relationships.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also trying to tackle the problem. As a non-commercial entity, it finances trade in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but carries the risk itself. Deputy director of financial institutions Rudolf Putz says in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Armenia, EBRD is one of the few international institutions still providing trade finance facilities. We have sufficient staff and money to analyse and take risk, which commercial banks would not be able to do, he says.

He is concerned that if countries are unable to access trade finance from international banks, people will be forced to manage money in riskier ways. Ironically, this is exactly what KYC set out to prevent.",0
467,"Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Peter C. Fitzhugh, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), announced the unsealing of an indictment charging PABLO RENATO RODRIGUEZ, GUTEMBERG DOS SANTOS, SCOTT HUGHES, CECILIA MILLAN, and JACKIE AGUILAR for their roles in an internationally coordinated fraud and money laundering ring involved in defrauding individuals through investments in AirBit Club, a purported cryptocurrency mining and trading company.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels. RODRIGUEZ and HUGHES are expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge John Early of the Central District of California, MILLAN is expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld of the Middle District of North Carolina, and AGUILAR is expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christine A. Nowak of the Eastern District of Texas. DOS SANTOS was arrested in Panama City, Panama, and is pending extradition to the United States.

Acting United States Attorney Audrey Strauss said: As alleged, the defendants put a modern-day spin on an age-old investment scam, promising extraordinary rates of guaranteed return on phantom investments in cryptocurrencies. Thanks to HSI, the defendants are in custody and facing serious criminal charges.

HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh said: Those arrested today have not only been charged with running a multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency investment fraud and money laundering ring, but also for allegedly spending their victims money on luxury cars, jewelry, and homes. These alleged fraudsters pulled out all the stops to sell their scheme to their victims with enticing recruitment events, then shamelessly used proceeds of their scheme to recruit additional victims through even more aggressive and lavish marketing pitches. As todays arrests show, HSI New Yorks El Dorado Task Force investigates financial crimes of every type, and will stop those who prey on unsuspecting investors who entrust their hard-earned savings to so-called financial advisors. Those who violate this trust for their personal gain will face consequences for their actions.

According to the allegations in the Superseding Indictment unsealed today: [1]

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, MILLAN, and AGUILAR participated in a coordinated scheme in which victim-investors (the Victims) were induced to invest in AirBit Club based on the promise of guaranteed profits in exchange for cash investments in club memberships (the AirBit Club Scheme or the Scheme). Beginning in late 2015, AirBit Club, through its founders, RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS, as well as its promoters (the Promoters), including MILLAN and AGUILAR, marketed AirBit Club as a multilevel marketing club in the cryptocurrency industry. Promoters falsely promised Victims that AirBit Club earned returns on cryptocurrency mining and trading and that Victims would earn passive, guaranteed daily returns on any membership purchased.

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, MILLAN, and AGUILAR traveled throughout the United States, and around the world to places in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, where they hosted lavish expos and small community presentations aimed at convincing Victims to purchase AirBit Club memberships. In furtherance of the AirBit Club Scheme, the Victims were induced to buy memberships in cash, including in the Southern District of New York. Following a Victims investment, a Promoter provided the Victim with access to an online AirBit Club portal to view the purported returns on memberships (the Online Portal). While Victims saw profits accumulate on their Online Portal, those representations were false: no Bitcoin mining or trading on behalf of Victims in fact took place. Instead, RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, MILLAN, and AGUILAR enriched themselves, and spent Victim money on cars, jewelry, and luxury homes, and financed more extravagant expos to recruit more Victims.

HUGHES, an attorney licensed to practice law in California, had previously represented RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation related to another investment scheme known as Vizinova before aiding RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS in perpetrating the AirBit Club Scheme by, among other things, helping to remove negative information about AirBit Club and Vizinova from the internet.

In many instances, as early as 2016, Victims who attempted to withdraw money from the AirBit Club Online Portal and complained to a Promoter were met with excuses, delays, and hidden fees amounting to more than 50% of the Victims requested withdrawal, if they were able to make any withdrawal at all. In one instance, AGUILAR told one Victim of the AirBit Club Scheme who was complaining about her inability to withdraw AirBit Club returns that she should bring new blood into the AirBit Club Scheme in order to receive her returns.

In April 2020, another victim received a notice on the AirBit Club Online Portal that his account was closed  and principal investment lost  due to execution of financial sustainability Reserve, policy #34 of the Airbit Club Terms and Conditions, due to the economic and financial crisis caused by (Covid-19).

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, and MILLAN sought to conceal the AirBit Club Scheme, as well as their respective control of the proceeds of that Scheme, by requesting that Victims purchase memberships in cash, using third-party cryptocurrency brokers, and by laundering the Schemes proceeds through several domestic and foreign bank accounts, including an attorney trust account managed by HUGHES (the Hughes Trust Account). The Hughes Trust Account was ostensibly intended to maintain custody of HUGHESs law practices client funds. Instead, the Hughes Trust Account was used by RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, and MILLAN to conceal the nature and origin of the AirBit Club Schemes illicit proceeds. Through that account, HUGHES directed Victim funds to the personal expenses of RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, MILLAN, and himself, and funded promotional events and sponsorships designed to further promote the AirBit Club Scheme. In total, the defendants laundered at least $20 million in proceeds of the Scheme through these various methods.

46,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police raided the home of Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor, adding to the graft scandals rocking President Michel Temerâs government.

Last month the Supreme Court opened a bribery probe into Maggiâs role in a scheme known as âmensalinho,â a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of Mato Grosso. He served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010.

According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, the raid was linked to a plea deal by former Mato Grosso state governor Silval Barbosa, who accuses Maggi of participating in the corruption scheme.

Barbosa was Maggiâs vice-governor, replacing him in the top job in 2010 when Maggi resigned to run for a seat in Brazilâs Senate. Barbosa was subsequently elected to a four-year term that ended in 2014.

Maggi denied any wrongdoing, claiming in a statement that Barbosa âliedâ in his plea bargain testimony.

âI never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have I obstructed justice,â Maggi said.

Maggi is a billionaire who was once Brazilâs largest soybean producer. His family firm Amaggi SA runs large farms in Mato Grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in Brazil with global firms like Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd.

Mato Grosso, where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities, is a major producer of grains and cattle. Raids were also conducted in SÃ£o Paulo and BrasÃ­lia, the police said in a statement.

The probe marks the latest blow to Temerâs administration, whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials, including the president. Temer has denied any wrongdoing.",1

One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.

Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265bn) of investors' money at Capital Group.

BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.

Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.

The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.

Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.

""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.

Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.

This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.

Leaked documents

The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.

It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.

Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.

Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.

In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.

An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.

Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.

""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""

The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.

'Complied with duties'

Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.

""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""

Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.

However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.

Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.

The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.

Controversial energy deal

Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.

However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.

Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.

Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.

Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.

Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.",1

The Hollywood producer Riza Aziz, stepson of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Mr Aziz, who produced The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was detained in Malaysia and bailed.

US prosecutors have accused Mr Aziz's production company of misappropriating money from a multi-billion dollar state fund to finance the film.

Mr Aziz's stepfather and mother have both been charged with corruption.

Mr Aziz will appear in court on Friday to face charges, said Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia's anti-corruption agency.

He has denied any wrongdoing. His production company, Red Granite, has already settled a civil lawsuit with the US government.

Mr Najib faces more than 40 charges and is accused of pocketing $681m (Â£540m) from the state fund 1MDB, short for 1Malaysia Development Berhad. His wife Rosmah Mansor has been charged with money-laundering and tax evasion.

Both have pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors have said the money was used to fund an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. Raids on properties linked to Mr Najib after he was toppled from power in May 2018 uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars.

Mr Aziz was also questioned last year over allegations of theft and money-laundering.

DiCaprio won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor for The Wolf of Wall Street and thanked Mr Aziz in his acceptance speech.

The US Justice Department has also accused Red Granite Pictures of using 1MDB funds to produce the films Dumb and Dumber To and Daddy's Home. The company denies any wrongdoing.

In May, about $57 million was forfeited by the company and put into an account in Malaysia set up to recoup funds allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB.",1
938,"The conflict in Syria is far from over, and Bashar al-Assads regime now faces the difficult task of organizing its forces to win the war and ensure the peace afterward. Further consolidation of Syrian sovereignty may cause a new wave of full-scale hostilities. Even if the regime fully controls Syrian territory, there will be a long period of internal instability with the risk of another uprising and regional separatism. Therefore, the development of the army remains a high priority for the Syrian government and its allies. The current poor state of the countrys armed forces is a result of hurried, ad-hoc steps during the war for survival, but a pause in hostilities makes it possible to streamline and reform the armed forces. The main issue remains choosing whether the Syrian armed forces (SAF) will focus more on conventional operations or internal security.

Russia can be a key player in the future of Syrian forces. The Russian command has already experimented with reforming the Syrian army, forming new large-scale, quasi-regular units and integrating various irregular and rebel groups into these units. It is difficult to expect the restoration of the prewar army, which was orientated to full-scale conventional war with external opponents.

The realities of the Syrian conflict make an internal security force a more likely option for reform. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, such a restoration would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. Apart from the lack of money, the shortage of manpower has been a critical issue for several years already. The Russian experience in Syria demonstrates that the main challenges facing SAF postwar reform are unit organization and effectiveness, force structure, and the integration of former rebels.

Russian Impressions on the State of the Syrian Army

In 2015, when planning to intervene in the Syrian civil war, Russian political leaders expected a quick victory. They thought that with the support of the Russian Air Force, the Syrian army and auxiliary progovernment forces would quickly turn the tide on the ground and regain the countrys territory. The whole active operation was conceived to be only for three to four months. Therefore, initially, no plans for large-scale Syrian military modernization were made. This clearly demonstrates insufficient Russian familiarity with the situation on the ground, despite the fact that Russia supported the regime from the very beginning of the civil war.

Like other external powers involved in Syria, Russia quickly realized that air strikes alone were not enough for success on the ground. According to the first commander of Russian military forces in Syria, colonel general Alexander Dvornikov, by the summer of 2015, the Syrian armed forces had completely exhausted themselves, the personnel were demoralized, the officer corps degraded, and the armed forces showed extremely low efficiency in command and control.

Victory could only be achieved by seriously improving the SAF or by creating new friendly forces. Russia is experienced in forming small, friendly armed forces. Over the past thirty years, the Russians have participated in the creation of quasi-regular military formations in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. In recent years, with the support of Russia, two bigger military forces were formed from scratch in separatist regions of Ukraine. These are heavy formations numbering tens of thousands of fighters equipped with hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-aircraft complexes, and drones. At the same time, modern Russia has little experience interacting with irregular formations. It is not surprising that in Syria, Russia chose to work with the regular army, leaving irregulars to Iranian influence.

The Russian military and political leadership have not officially announced plans for the future development of the Syrian army, but Russia began to participate in its improvement even before it entered the war in September 2015. After the official start of the intervention, these efforts grew significantly in scale. They suggest how Russia sees the future of the Syrian army.

First Attempt at Modernization: 4th Corps

The first Russian attempt to modernize Syrian forces was the creation of the 4th Assault Corps, which began shortly before the start of the Russian Air Force operation in September 2015. This modernization was mostly administrative. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a diverse mix from the 2nd Infantry Division, the 103rd Republican Guard Brigade, the 1st Assault Brigade, the 48th, the 53rd Special Purpose Regiment, and the Marines Battalion become part of the new formation under the control of a new headquarters in Latakia. New units created from National Defence Force irregulars and conscripts from Latakia were also included. Eventually, the 4th Corps contained more than twenty separate assault groups of about one hundred soldiers each. Thus, the entire corps barely exceeded 2,000 frontline fighters and did not reach the strength of a full-fledged division.

Russia also helped with the repair of 4th Corps heavy military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers. Recruits also received quick and basic combat training from Russian military advisers. Nonetheless, there was no sizable Russian investment in this corps, particularly in small scale equipment. The main added value was supposed to be better command and control. Senior Russian officers were assigned as advisers to the corps and units headquarters, and helped manage operations and coordination with Russian air forces.

The first offensive operation of 4th Corps began on October 8, 2015, just a week after the start of the Russian intervention. Assault groups were sent to al-Ghab Plain and the mountainous region of Latakia to remove the threat to the province and the Russian air base there. Intense Russian air strikes and cruise missile attacks supported the corps offensive. The recapture of the mountainous region of the province of Latakia took six months, while Ghab Plain is yet to be controlled by Damascus.

Even though the Ghab/Latakia operation did not meet with complete success, some of the experience gained in Russia-Syria military interaction quickly spread to other parts of the country. Advisers from senior ranks of the Russian army were appointed to nearly every battalion, brigade, and division of the regular government army. The Russian military and state-hired private military contractors also worked with some quasi-regular formations, such as the elite Tiger Forces.

The Russian Ministry of Defense admits that sometimes Russian advisers played a more active role than it had planned. After the death of the commander of the 124th brigade of the Republican Guard in May 2017, the unit was effectively run by a Russian adviser for a week, until a Syrian replacement was sent. Russia thus assessed that reorganization based on existing units with minimal investments would be ineffective, and their combat value would be insufficient. Problems arose not only with the command and control structure but also with the motivation of the troops, their training, and combat effectiveness. Therefore, Russia decided to spend much more attention and resources on creating a new 5th Volunteer Assault Corps, also known in Syria as the 5th Legion.

A Model for the Future? 5th Corps

From November 2016, a much more ambitious attempt to create a new combat-ready unit of the Syrian army began. Even though the assault on East Aleppo had ended successfully by that time, it was obvious to the Russian command that the existing progovernment forces, regular and irregular alike, were still extremely ineffective.

The new 5th Corps was composed completely of volunteers, to avoid the typical conscript challenges with desertion and insufficient motivation. Fighters received 200300 U.S. dollars per month, which is quite an attractive salary in war-ravaged Syria. It is not known where the funds for the financing of the corps came from, but apparently Russia is one of the primary sources of weapons, equipment, and combat vehicles for the corps. Personnel received basic training from Russian instructors, as well as more prolonged and extensive tactical training.

Due to the lack of human resources, the 5th Corps composition became mixed. It brought together units of very different origins and motivations, mostly former irregular units outside the military command structure, such as the National Defense Forces or loyal Baath Battalions. Additional units were formed by recruiting new volunteers and demobilized veterans. Dedicated recruitment centers for the 5th Corps were created all over Syria, including in Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Tartus, Latakia, and Sweida. In 2018 former rebels from Daraa Province were also recruited into the 5th Corps.

Initially, the Russian military not only advised Syrian commanders but was in total command of the new corps at operational and tactical levels, which was necessary to break the problem of the rotten Syrian command and control structure. As Syrian personnel have gained more combat experience, the situation has shifted toward Russian advisers having less power in the 5th Corps.

An important difference from the typical Russian or Ukrainian separatist army corps was the almost complete absence of corps-level support units. In the regular army, the corps would have numerous artillery, missile, air defense brigades and regiments, and specialized support battalions, trained to fight together. The 5th Assault Corps remained organized as mostly independent infantry units, united by a joint command. Only a few select units received additional heavy weapons, but unlike for the 4th Corps these were not only outdated tanks. In addition to the old T-62M, these select 5th Corps units received upgraded T-72B3 tanks and T-90A tanks, which are purchased even today by the Russian army.

The newly created militia and irregular units, including those in the 5th Corps, are already being equipped with machine guns and pickup trucks mounted with automatic cannons. Attached artillery include multiple rocket launchers installed on the same automobile chassis. Such formations are seriously inferior in combat effectiveness to mechanized infantry, but because of their low price, they are the most affordable option for creating and re-forming future regular military units.

Despite this, challenges remain. The 5th Corps remains unstructured. While the total number of fighters in the corps is difficult to estimate, it probably exceeds 10,000 people. For Syria, the formation of such a large and relatively heavy military unit from scratch is a great achievement.The practice has shown that this corps project was more successful than with the 4th Corps. The 5th Corps was used to storm Palmyra, to establish control over the Syrian desert, to de-blockade Deir Ezzor and to capture the Euphrates valley and Daraa. In March 2019, the corps, almost in full composition, was sent to prepare for the attack on opposition-held Idlib Province.

The Russian military command highly praised the effectiveness of the 5th Corps. Especially noteworthy was the fact that the all-volunteer and relatively well-paid structure was sufficiently loyal to be used not just regionally, but all over the country. In terms of mobility, the 5th Corps has caught up with the most combat-ready Syrian units, such as the 4th Armored Division and elite Tiger Forces. Still, an important issue is whether this corps and its followers will remain relatively light in composition or later receive additional heavy military equipment and a more heavy structure? Today such a structure is compensated by the Russian air power, but self-sufficiency may require heavier native firepower.

Future Structure: Heavy or Light?

It is difficult to expect the restoration of the heavy prewar army, oriented for full-scale conventional war with external opponents. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, it would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. There is no way for Syria to restore the previous number of tanks and armored vehicles, aircraft, and air defense systems available before the war. Their only source can be Russia. But so far no plans for large-scale procurements have been announced, and those that took place were limited. This is especially true for sophisticated modern weapons.

The only significant supply of S-300 air defense systems was a situational reaction by Russia to the loss of an IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft to the friendly fire of Syrian air defense weapons. There has been no full restoration or a serious buildup of the countrys air defense forces to a level capable of effectively protecting it from Israel and the United States. There have been no purchases and deliveries of new aircraft, either fixed or rotary wing. In the near future, Syria can expect only a small delivery of transport helicopters vital for supporting the mobility of the Syrian army.

The experience of supplying advanced tanks to Syrian forces was not very successful. The crews that lacked sufficient training used them with the same tactics as the ancient T-55 and T-72 models without much effect on the battlefield. Vital to the war effort was Russian assistance in the restoration of armored vehicles. More than 1,100 tons of spare parts for armored vehicles were transferred to Syria. Russia helped to set up the Homs tank repair/overhaul facility and smaller repair shops in Jabla and Latakia. In 20152017, they repaired 3,572 armored vehicles and another 1,244 in 2018. Such a high level of support allowed the countrys land forces to maintain some armored combat capability over the years, despite heavy losses.

Russia was also generous with the supply of heavy infantry weapons, such as 23mm ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, large-caliber machine guns, and Kornet anti-tank systems, which are also used as multipurpose support weapons. Anti-tank guided missiles played an increasing role in Syrian ground force action and gave the the SAF a necessary technical edge over rebel forces. Such infantry weapons are not only cheaper, but easier to master, and they are ideal for the tactics of small and quasi-regular units. Still, mass training and retaining high-quality officers and soldiers capable of operating sophisticated modern weapons is a challenging task for modern Syria. This is a severe limiting factor in the restoration of a heavy army.

The Problem of Integrating Former Rebels Units

The reinstatement of government control over vast swaths of territory in 2018 and numerous supposed reconciliation deals with former rebel regions have given the government an important source of personnel to rebuild Syrian regular forces. Nonetheless, there is no indication that the Syrian government has developed a unified approach to the reintegration of former rebels into national armed forces.

The regime prefers to pursue a policy of disarming surrendering rebel units, then dissolving them and recruiting individual fighters. Such an approach makes former rebels a dormant source of much-needed manpower. For many surrendering rebels, service in the army or auxiliary troops remains the only way to make a living and to avoid political persecution.

In addition to the apparent doubts about questionable loyalty of large ex-rebel contingents, their weapons and equipment are not in line with those of progovernment forces, which makes supply difficult. Fighters have mixed levels of training, and many do not have any. As a result, reconciled units, in general, do not represent a coherent and combat-worthy force useful for induction into the army and would require a complete overhaul anyway.

There are only a few examples of small rebel formations of company and battalion size that transferred to serve and fight in Syrian auxiliary units as a whole. Russia also showed flexibility in making local, temporary alliances with nongovernment forces like tribal militia units in the valley of the Euphrates River and YPG factions of Syrian Democratic Forces there. In the final stages of the defeat of the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Syria in December 2017, Russian officers and soldiers of Special Operations Forces were sent to these YPG factions as military advisers. The Russian Air Force provided close air support for the advancing Kurds. A joint headquarters was created to coordinate the actions of Russia and the militias of the Euphrates valley.

However, this was an exception to the rule, and there is no reason to expect that this approach will change concerning rebels forces in Idlib and At-Tanf. Here the government will likely prefer to disband local forces even if they manage to reach a peace agreement with them. Given the long history of armed hostility and the large number of radical Islamists in their ranks, the reliability and loyalty of such units will be always questionable.

The future of forces in the territories now under Turkish control will depend entirely on the conditions of a political settlement. But after Operation Peace Spring, it is clear that Turkey is not going to leave Syria. Of the former rebels there, Turkey formed a well-organized proxy, the Syrian National Army. It is difficult to imagine that these units, which are completely loyal and controlled by a hostile foreign state, can be somehow integrated into the Syrian armed forces, even in the long term.

The situation is different in the SDF-controlled region of the country. The Turkish operation Source of Peace in October 2019 pushed the Kurds toward reconciliation with the central government. The Syrian armed forces are now peacefully deployed on a substantial amount of SDF territories. The Syrian Ministry of Defense announced its readiness to integrate SDF troops into the regular army. The SDF General Command cautiously announced its readiness for such a step in the future, but not before a full political settlement between the Kurdish regions and the central government of the country. Such rapprochement is definitely possible, given the low level of hostility between the parties throughout the conflict.

Inevitably, the question of the fate of the SDFs well-organized and battle-hardened forces will arise. Dissolving Kurdish units and subsequently conscripting individual fighters would be ineffective. The regime must find another way to integrate them into the military, while striking a delicate balance between the autonomy of SDF units and their subordination to central command.

One method to strike this balance could be through government-run headquarters of divisions or army corps. The existing SDF brigades and battalions could be subordinated to these headquarters, which would lead on operational control and planning, personnel, supply, and logistical management and financing.

Conclusion

Russia does not plan to recreate the Syrian army in its prewar form. Modern Syria is not able to pay for this, and other allies cannot sponsor it. The ultimate goal of Russia is to create a self-sufficient SAF that will be able to maintain the unity and internal stability of the country without direct military assistance. Such a goal well coincides with the interests of the Syrian regime and will provide an exit strategy for Russia.

Russian plans to unite forces under a single command are in direct conflict with the interests of Iran, which Syria relies on for an extensive network of loyal yet irregular formations. These units are financed by Iran and are therefore more faithful to Tehran than Damascus. The final word on the composition of the regular army will still be with Russia, and it is unlikely that Russia is ready to yield to Iran in this matter. A tightly integrated vertical command structure is a critical element of Russian military strategy.

In any case, the mobile armored fist of the few elite mechanized units will remain. Its presence is necessary not only for the rapid concentration and unity of forces but also for reasons of national pride. The model tested in the 5th Corps offers a cost-effective way of organizing a mix of many different small units into larger, better-managed military structures. Unifying the chain of command is necessary to transform irregular units into regular and quasi-regular status. Such a structure would allow, if necessary, the easy integration of opposition units, including the SDF because their organization, tactics, and weapons are not very different from those of the SAF.

A serious challenge for the Syrian regime will be the need to establish its own effective command and control structure after the departure of Russian advisers. Also, it will not be easy to find financing to motivate the whole army the same way as the 5th Corps. The armament of the Syrian armed forces will consist almost exclusively of outdated equipment for the foreseeable future. From pure necessity, the government must concentrate on resources already on the ground. Significant development of the Syrian air, air defense, and naval forces is not a priority.

The Syrian army should be sufficient to suppress local uprisings and maintain the integrity of the country. At the same time, in this context the SAF would not pose a serious threat to neighbors, including Israel and Turkey. Since Russia is trying to maintain good relations with regional powers, this is a crucial deciding factor.

The main problem for the regime remains the loyalty of the renewed army. At the beginning of the conflict, entire military units changed sides. In recent years, Assad has been able to stop such cases by combining better material rewards, building patriotism among the people, and using brutal repression. If a large number of former antagonists were to be included in the army, even these means might not be enough, so maintaining the loyalty and stability of the armed forces will always remain a headache.

In the more distant future, after establishing lasting peace in the country, the structure of the army may change again. Given the nations decades of history of employing heavy mechanized military units, the SAF will inevitably gravitate to a heavier regular structure. Still, such a prospect will require significant strengthening of the economy and the political stability of the regime and is not even on the horizon.",0
544,"ATHENS, Greece -- Russian cybercrime suspect Alexander Vinnik, who is wanted in the United States on charges of laundering billions of dollars' worth of the virtual currency bitcoin, appeared Wednesday before Greece's Supreme Court for a hearing into his extradition to the U.S.

Vinnik is the subject of a judicial tug-of-war between the U.S. and Russia, which is also seeking his extradition on lesser charges.

The U.S. is accusing Vinnik of laundering $4 billion worth of bitcoins through BTC-e, one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges, which he allegedly operated.

Russia, meanwhile, wants him back to face charges related to a 667,000-ruble ($11,500) fraud.

Lower courts in Greece have approved both extradition requests. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in coming days. If it decides in favor of extradition to the U.S., Greece's justice minister will have the final word on where the suspect will be sent.

Vinnik, who denies any involvement in bitcoin fraud, is fighting his extradition to the United States, but not to Russia.

The 37-year-old was arrested on a U.S. request in July while on holiday with his family in the Halkidiki area of northern Greece, which is popular with Russian tourists.

The U.S. Justice Department says Vinnik has been indicted by a grand jury in the Northern District of California on charges including money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions. The charges carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison.",1

The European Parliament has urged EU governments to impose sanctions on 32 Russian officials over the death of a lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.

The parliament's resolution calls for visa bans and asset freezes - measures that the US has already imposed.

Magnitsky died in prison in 2009 after accusing officials of tax fraud.

A Moscow court convicted Magnitsky himself of embezzlement posthumously - a trial seen in the West as a gross miscarriage of justice.

There is evidence that he suffered torture and neglect in prison. The US blacklist, in force since 2012, drew strong condemnation from Russia.

Acting on behalf of London-based Hermitage Capital Management, Magnitsky had exposed an alleged fraud in which government officials stole $230m (Â£138m; 169m euros) of tax revenue.

But instead of prosecuting any of the alleged embezzlers, the police arrested Magnitsky.

Frosty relations

The MEPs' resolution comes amid heightened tensions between the EU and Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The EU and US have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on senior Russian officials considered to be linked to the annexation.

Various politicians in Europe have urged their governments to adopt a US-style Magnitsky list. Last year the Irish parliament dropped plans for such a blacklist after Russia warned that it might stop adoptions by Irish parents in retaliation.

Many of the names on the proposed European Magnitsky list are also among the 18 named in the US list, including interior ministry investigators Pavel Karpov and Oleg Silchenko, and judge Yelena Stashina.

The European Parliament said the arrest and death in custody of Magnitsky represented a ""well-documented and significant case of disrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia"", which had ""cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of its judicial institutions, and serve as a reminder of the many documented shortcomings in respect for the rule of law in Russia"".",0
470,"A former senior executive with Alstom S.A. (Alstom), a French power and transportation company, was sentenced in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, to 15 months in prison today for his role in a multi-year, multimillion-dollar money laundering scheme designed to promote violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of Connecticut and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacout of the FBIs Los Angeles Office made the announcement.

Lawrence Hoskins, 69, was sentenced on charges of conspiracy and money laundering, following his conviction in November 2019, after a one-week jury trial before U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, who imposed todays sentence. In addition to his prison term, Hoskins was fined $30,000.

According to the evidence presented at trial, Hoskins was a senior vice president for Alstoms International Network, who engaged in a conspiracy to promote the payment of bribes to officials in Indonesia in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for Alstom Power Inc. of Connecticut and its consortium partner, Marubeni Corporation, to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. The officials in Indonesia included a high-ranking member of the Indonesian Parliament and the President of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity company in Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, Hoskins and his co-conspirators retained two consultants purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of Alstom Power Inc., in connection with the Tarahan project. The primary purpose of hiring the consultants was to conceal the bribes to Indonesian officials, the evidence showed.

The first consultant retained by Hoskins and other members of the conspiracy received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank account to be used to bribe the member of Parliament, the evidence showed. The consultant then transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of the official. According to emails admitted at trial, Hoskins and other co-conspirators discussed in detail the use of the first consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project, including referring to him as a cashier.

The trial evidence further showed that, in the fall of 2003, Hoskins and his co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was not effectively bribing key officials at PLN, who expressed concerns that the first consultant was just going to give them pocket money and disappear after Alstom Power Inc. won the project. As a result, the co-conspirators retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN officials. Evidence revealed that Hoskins and his co-conspirators pressed Alstom Power Inc. to front-load the second consultants terms of payment in order to get the right influence due to upcoming elections. Hoskins and his co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials.

The FBIs Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General and the United Kingdom, as well as authorities in France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

The financial crimes regulator concluded that Afterpay had âcompleted all remediation necessary to ensure complianceâ.
Afterpayâs share price rose higher on Tuesday, gaining around 3% in early trade, as the company valuation overtakes that of gold miner Newcrest.
Visit Business Insider Australiaâs homepage for more stories.

Afterpayâs share price has broken yet another high as it heads towards the $100 mark, as a major regulatory cloud lifts.

The financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC revealed on Wednesday that it had concluded a 14-month investigation into Afterpay and would take no further action against the buy now, pay later company.

It had assigned an external auditor in June last year to investigate whether it had breached Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF).

âIn response to the findings and recommendations identified in the external audit report, Afterpay has uplifted its AML/CTF compliance framework and financial crime function, and completed all remediation necessary to ensure compliance,â the regulator said in a statement.

AUSTRAC said it had reiterated the importance to Afterpay that it comply with the law and ârole in fighting financial crime to protect the Australian community from harmâ.

Afterpay chair Elana Rubin said the company was âpleasedâ with the result and now better understood its obligations and how to manage risks.

The market was clearly pleased too, as Afterpayâs stock price rose by around 3% to over $97 a share in early trade.

The threat of a negative finding put the fintech darling at risk of major fines and regulatory consequences.

A 2018 AUSTRAC investigation found the Commonwealth Bank had helped drug traffickers move money using the bankâs âsmartâ ATMs. It was a finding that would cost Australiaâs largest bank face, not to mention $700 million.

More recently, Westpac copped a $1.3 billion fine for enabling child abusers to transfer money to South East Asia.

No such luck for Afterpay. The latest ride higher sets its market cap at more than $26.3 billion, more than Coles and Newcrest Mining, and making its billionaire founders even richer. On paper at least.",0
61,"Zimbabwean anti-corruption investigators said Monday they are probing whether former First Lady Grace Mugabe fraudulently obtained a doctorate that she apparently received within months and the dissertation for which remains unpublished.

Grace, whose apparent desire to succeed her 93-year-old husband prompted the army takeover that eventually saw Robert Mugabe resign, was awarded a PhD by the University of Zimbabwe in 2014.

Critics argued at the time that Grace, 52, had not actually studied or undertaken research to earn the doctorate and that she had been handed her diploma just months after enrolling. PhDs typically require several years of full-time research and writing.

Her dissertation has never been made public, according to local media, breaking with the established policy of most Zimbabwean public universities to publish doctoral studentsâ theses.

The state-run Herald newspaper reported in 2014 that Graceâs dissertation was on the theme of âchanging social structure (and) the functions of the familyâ and that she undertook research on Zimbabwean childrenâs homes.

Grace was personally capped by then-president Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, and praised by other government officials who defended the controversial degree award.

âWe confirm there is such a report and there is such a probe,â said Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission spokeswoman Phyllis Chikundura who declined to provide further details.

In November 2017, Robert Mugabe fired then-vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a move that was seen as opening the way for his wifeâs succession. A few days later the military took control of the country, leading to Mugabeâs resignation on November 21.

Mnangagwa was sworn in as president days later and both Robert and Grace have kept a low profile since their spectacular reversal of fortune.

During the height of the upheaval, students at the University of Zimbabwe boycotted their end of term exams to call for Grace to be stripped of her PhD and Robert to be stripped of the presidency.

Grace was routinely accused of extravagant spending on luxury clothes and international travel, and of involvement in corrupt land deals.

Dubbed âGucci Graceâ, âThe First Shopperâ or even âDisGraceâ, she showed her political mettle in 2014 with her ruthless campaign against then Vice President Joice Mujuru, who was then a contender to succeed her husband.

A similar briefing campaign â conducted both publicly and behind the scenes â against Mnangagwa is widely seen as having led to her husbandâs downfall.

MasterCard notes that more than $118 billion in sales were lost in the U.S. to false declines in 2014, and if you're a retailer or a card issuer, there must be no worse way of losing a customer than having them fall victim to a false decline of a transaction: I'm not sure what response most people would have to being falsely declined, but I know if it happened to me, I wouldn't returning to that retailer or using that card again anytime soon.

Yet while Javelin and MasterCard both note how huge and widespread a problem this has been, the risk assessment tools used to battle it seem woefully inadequate. That is particularly the case when the sector has technology at its disposal that could be used to analyze and weigh many distinct factors involved in any single transaction.

Fraud prevention seems an area ripe for AI to improve on current practices, though surprisingly, we have not heard much from the major card companies until now, even as AI quickly has become a widely studied technology (and somewhat widely deployed, though it's still early) in retail and other industries in which card payments also play an important role. Payments firm Stripe notably launched an AI-based fraud detection service recently, though it didn't specifically mention reduction of false declines as one of its aims.

The card companies certainly have brought new technology to bear in the fight against fraud, most obviously in the form of EMV chip cards, but the apparent immensity of the false decline problem should be a reminder to them that their fraud strategies need to be comprehensive and multi-layered â one advancement doesn't solve all the problems.

Overall, AI not only can improve on current fraud analysis processes, but also evolve over time by using its own machine learning capabilities to continue refining how it views and handles ongoing transactions involving the same customers and payment cards. Ultimately, it can be another tool for improving the customer experience â something it's best to work on before another false decline drives them away.",0
901,"PUTRAJAYA: A foundation has been launched to provide assistance to officers of anti-corruption agencies who are victimised, persecuted or abused for carrying out their duties.

The Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion Foundation (Piaccf) is also meant to help those who have been intimidated, threatened or maliciously punished while on duty.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the foundation would be responsible for the International Anti-Corruption Champion Fund and to complement the aspirations of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (Uncac).

""We know that combating and exposing corruption is very dangerous, and the world has witnessed many who attempted to do so pay dearly, even with their lives.

""Obviously, those who involve themselves in corruption are powerful and rich, and their objectives are for more power and wealth and to have the means and resources to punish and stop those who attempt to put an end to their shenanigans.

""We are here to tell the world that all the anti-corruption officers who have paid heavy prices in the course of their duty are our champions and our heroes,"" he said when launching the foundation on Tuesday night (Feb 11).

The Prime Minister paid tribute to the contributions of several individuals in the fight against corruption.

They include former attorney-general Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, former Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief commissioner Datuk Seri Shukri Abdull in relation to the 1MDB scandal.

""It is a significant case, as it became the turning point of Malaysiaâs political direction and sparked an awakening among Malaysians.

""Their collective courage and determination brought a kleptocratic regime down, in an unprecedented show of people's power.

""I would also like to express my utmost respect to all the men and women across the globe who had given their time, lives and commitment in putting an end to the corruption scourge,"" said Dr Mahathir.

The event also saw two anti-graft officers being honoured after having paid a heavy price in their efforts to combat corruption.

The recipients of the Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion 2020 Award are Datuk Anthony Kevin Morais, a senior deputy public prosecutor who was murdered in 2015 while investigating a corruption scandal, and Novel Baswedan, an officer with Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission, who during one of his investigations in June 2016, had acid thrown at him.

It left him partially blind.

""Indeed, there are many other brave officers who suffered in upholding their integrity.

""To them, the awards to Morais and Baswedan symbolise our appreciation to all of them,"" said the Prime Minister.

Dr Mahathir said he was proud Malaysia had taken a leading role in addressing issues affecting anti-corruption officers, starting with the introduction of the foundation.

""I sincerely hope that our contribution will send the message to all the officers of the anti-corruption agency that the government of Malaysia is with you all the way.

""And, this should also send the message to the corrupt and corruptors that we do not want you in our midst,"" he said.",0

President Trump has been brushing aside advice from some campaign advisers who are privately urging him to prepare for a possible election loss, according to a report.

Instead, the president has remained defiant, with his legal team preparing to mount legal challenges in several battleground states, over claims of fraud in connection with the voting.

While aides have advised the president that lawsuits are unlikely to wipe out Democratic nominee Joe Bidenâs leads in uncalled states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, Trump has seemed uninterested in moving toward a concession, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing several sources speaking on condition of anonymity.

Trump remained behind Biden in the electoral count by early Saturday and appeared to have an increasingly small path to reelection as votes continued to be counted.

The president made allegations with little evicence of widespread fraud this week and said the election was being stolen from him when mail-in ballots counts began to favor Biden.

The campaignâs legal efforts have scored some gains â including an order by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that any Pennsylvania ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward should be segregated and counted separately â but none have succeeded in changing the vote count in the presidentâs favor.

Some of the president's advisers told the Journal they believe a Trump loss is an eventuality.

âThey have a no-stone-unturned strategy,â one adviser said, âbut at some point, you have to wonder when enough is enough.â

Aides are also urging Trump to stay on script and to focus on his final months in office.

One adviser told the Journal the presidentâs mood is âblack,â and he has spent much of his time on the phone telling aides to do everything in their power to avoid an electoral loss.

Publicly, Trumpâs team and many Republicans have supported his claims and called for any election regularities to be investigated.

Earlier this week, the presidentâs son, Donald Trump Jr., accused âvirtually all of the â2024 GOP hopefulsâ"" of a ""lack of action.""

âThey have a perfect platform to show that theyâre willing & able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead,â he tweeted.

Son Eric Trump on Friday alleged that the Democratic National Committe was behind ""spamming"" of the Trump campaign's voter fraud hotline, claiming it was a bid to ""bog down the thousands of complaints we are receiving!""

""Wonder what they have to hide,"" Trump wrote.",0
72,"A serial fraudster who posed as a solicitor and pretended to represent âextremely vulnerableâ women in court cases has been jailed for four years and handed a ten-year restraining order.

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Daveyâs bank account.

All dealings with the âsolicitorâ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

At one point, Davey told a mother that she had won full custody of her children and had been awarded Â£65,000.

As a result of Daveyâs deception, the women were not represented in court and both their cases were put in âsevere jeopardyâ.

According to the police statement, Davey also posed as a police officer and a probation worker, and convinced a woman he was in love with her in order to extort money. The court heard that Davey extorted more than Â£7,000 in total from his victims.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert of Warrington CID said: âStephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims. His offending showed significant premeditation and he attempted to cover his tracks at every turn.â",1
588,"The UKs Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at mining and commodity trading group Glencore.

The SFO said it is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons.

In a statement, the £30bn company added: Glencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group.

Glencore, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation.

Its share price fell by 9% on the news to close at 216.9p, a three-year low. The company is the worlds biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium.

The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africas biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007.

The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC.

Gertlers notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nations former president Joseph Kabila  who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year  has long been a source of controversy.

Gertler was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the countrys diamonds.

The Israeli was also named in a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue.

In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC.

The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are false and without any basis whatsoever, that he rejects them absolutely, and that he transacts business fairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law.

Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own.

The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as the biggest tax evasion case in United States history.

He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on trading with the enemy. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBIs most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001.

By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993.

Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the worlds biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones.

When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at £38bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since.",1
796,"A Japanese company has developed an artificial intelligence-powered automated teller machine to prevent fraudulent money transfers, the first of its kind in the country.

The system, which can recognise the appearance and movement of ATM users through an embedded camera, aims to help prevent crimes in which scammers guide elderly victims over the phone to transfer money by making them believe they will be refunded a higher amount.

Despite repeated warnings by authorities and other entities, financial losses related to so-called refund money wiring fraud remain high in Japan, totalling about 1.07 billion yen (US$9.5 million) in the first half of 2018, according to the National Police Agency.

If the AI recognises a user talking over the phone during a money transfer, the screen displays a warning to stop the transaction. The ATM will also ask users to take off any masks or sunglasses, and if they do not follow the instructions, the transaction will be cancelled automatically.

The AI system was designed to memorise a huge number of images based on the âdeep learningâ method, and boasts a highly precise detection technique, according to Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions Corp., which aims to commercialise the system in the next financial year starting in April.

In October, the Aichi prefectural police unveiled the ATM to the public and held a drill for local residents to prevent frauds and test new features of the machine.

âThe new ATM feature is groundbreaking as the machine itself can help prevent crime. We expect it to be highly effective,â a senior official of the prefectural police said.",0
515,"A judge has sentenced the fake German heiress Anna Sorokin to four to 12 years in prison for defrauding hotels, restaurants, a private jet operator and banks out of more than $200,000.

Judge Diane Kiesel said she was stunned by the depth of the defendants deception, her labyrinthine lies that kept her con afloat at the sentencing on Thursday afternoon in Manhattan state court. As she handed down sentence, Kiesel reportedly made a reference to Bruce Springsteens song Blinded by the Light.

She was blinded by the glitter and glamour of New York City, the judge said, according to BuzzFeed News.

Sorokin, a would-be art collector, planned to open a members-only arts club but became known as the Soho grifter after her deception upon New Yorks glitzy social scene came to light. Sorokin, 28, was found guilty last month of grand larceny and theft of services.

During the trial she was admonished for throwing tantrums when she couldnt get her stylist-curated outfits, and drew unflattering sketches of the lead prosecutor during testimony.

But at sentencing she was humbled. Wearing a long-sleeved black dress, she told the judge: I apologize for the mistakes I made.

Sorokins story became a media sensation, and she received lengthy profiles in magazines and reams of tabloid coverage. A TV series about her life was also planned.

At the trial, prosecutors said she overdrew a bank account and forged financial records to further the ruse that she perpetrated under the name Anna Delvey. The jury agreed she had fraudulently maneuvered herself into the best position to take money from a social milieu of wealthy collectors, dealers and auctioneers.

Prosecutors said Sorokins ambition was to live the fantasy of an extravagant lifestyle beyond her means. But her lawyers argued that Sorokin was hardly unique in understanding that superficial glamour was key to acceptance in the circles she aspired to join.

 Fake it until you make it,  explained her lawyer, Todd Spodek. He conceded that his clients practice was unethical but, he claimed, not illegal because she planned to pay everyone back. Any millennial will tell you, he said, it is not uncommon to have delusions of grandeur.

The jury rejected some of the charges against her, including an alleged attempt to fraudulently obtain a $22m (£17m) loan, and an accusation that she had swindled $60,000 from a friend who had paid for a lavish trip to Morocco.

Prosecutors told the court Sorokin now has barely a cent to her name.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has said it will seek to deport Sorokin, who was born in Russia, to Germany following her release from state custody. Ice said Sorokin overstayed her 2017 visa.",1
598,"Frances former Budget Minister, Jérôme Cahuzac, is on trial this week for tax fraud.

Cahuzac, who was considered the French governments white knight during his appointment for his actions against wealthy tax dodgers, has been accused of illegally concealing 687,000 of income from French tax authorities in 2009-2013 and laundering money in 2003-2013 through bank accounts in Switzerland, Panama, the Seychelles and Singapore.

If convicted, Cahuzac could face up to seven years in prison and a 2m fine.

The disgraced former ministers lawyers have argued that the trial should be postponed, as Cahuzac is under both criminal and tax procedures at the same time.

In a statement in April 2013, he admitted wrongdoing despite months of strenuous denials to both Parliament and the media, including one of Frances top political interviewers.

Cahuzac, French President François Hollandes leading tax specialist, was sponsoring a bill to crack down on tax evasion when the allegations of tax crimes came to light in December 2012.",1

âThe Index shows in detail how the anti-corruption wave that was advancing in Latin America a few years ago has lost steam and, in some places, is dangerously receding.

900,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of Mexicoâs organized crime unit stepped down on Thursday, just weeks after announcing that members of his team had been charged with having links to the nationâs most powerful drug cartel.

Jose Cuitlahuac Salinas, head of the unit in the attorney generalâs office, resigned for âpersonal reasons,â a spokesman for the office said.

Attorney General Marisela Morales has accepted his resignation, which was effective immediately, he added.

Salinas will be replaced by Rodrigo Archundia Barrientos, an expert on kidnappings at the organized crime unit, Morales said in a statement.

On October 17 Salinas said the Mexican government had charged seven officials, including three members of his unit, with passing information on government raids and investigations to the Sinaloa cartel of Joaquin âShortyâ Guzman, Mexicoâs most-wanted man.

Salinas himself was not being investigated, the spokesman at the attorney generalâs office said.

Mexicoâs powerful drug cartels are suspected of spending millions of dollars a year to corrupt officials, but charges are not common and convictions are few and far between.

President Felipe Calderon, who leaves office at the end of the month, staked his reputation on bringing the drug gangs to heel. But his offensive against organized crime coincided with a sharp increase in drug-related violence in Mexico.

More than 60,000 people have been killed in clashes between the gangs and their battles with security forces since Calderon took office six years ago.

This month Mexico charged 14 federal police officers with the attempted murder of two CIA operatives after the U.S. agentsâ vehicle was sprayed with bullets in a daylight attack that security officials suspect was ordered by a drug cartel.",0
338,"Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar, who was arrested and charged with racketeering last month in an ongoing pay-to-play probe, now faces additional charges including bribery and money laundering, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

The new charges were included in a 34-count grand jury indictment expanding on earlier allegations that Huizar headed up a criminal enterprise that leveraged his power at City Hall for financial gain, aiding real estate developers who handed over bribes including cash, free flights, casino chips and other perks.

The 113-page indictment also includes claims that others conspired with Huizar in the scheme, including a former deputy mayor who previously headed the Department of Building and Safety. Federal prosecutors allege that Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million in illicit financial benefits.

He is the fifth person to be charged in the ongoing investigation, which has netted guilty pleas from former Huizar aide George Esparza, real estate consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim and former Councilman Mitchell Englander.

The indictment alleges that Huizar tried to cover up the illicit money in several ways, including guiding his aide on how to avoid bank reporting requirements and using family members to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. It also alleges that he made false statements to federal prosecutors and the FBI.

Huizar, 51, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Attorneys for the councilman have previously stated that Huizar âintends to respond to the governmentâs allegations in court.â He is now being represented by attorneys from the federal public defenderâs office, one of whom declined to comment Thursday.

Many of the allegations in the indictment were revealed last month in a criminal complaint against the councilman, including that a Chinese billionaire planning a new skyscraper in his downtown district provided $600,000 in collateral to help Huizar quietly settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former aide.

But the document lays out additional details about the alleged crimes. For instance, the criminal complaint alleged that a businessman who wanted Huizar to introduce him to developers paid for gifts including expensive suits, meals and hotel stays for the councilman to meet with a woman with whom he was having an affair.

The indictment, in turn, lays out an itemized list of those alleged gifts with dates and dollar amounts, such as a âsuit and shirtsâ worth $6,000 on June 13, 2016, and âhotel accommodationâ worth $1,513.49 on June 19, 2017.

In another instance, the criminal complaint filed in June included allegations that a real estate developer provided political donations as part of a bribery scheme to win approval for an Arts District project. The indictment adds another allegation: that an executive with that development company talked to Huizar about hiring the councilman after he left office.

Federal prosecutors have not named the former deputy mayor allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise, but biographical details included in the indictment and criminal complaint make clear it is Raymond Chan, who has not been arrested or publicly charged in the case.

His attorney, Harland Braun, did not immediately provide comment Thursday but has previously stated that Chan did nothing wrong.

The charges that Huizar faces carry maximum sentences that could stretch for decades, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorneyâs office in Los Angeles. Money laundering, for instance, can be punished by up to 20 years in federal prison, while making false statements to a financial institution carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.",1
967,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is ready to work with whoever wins the U.S. election, two top Turkish officials said on Friday, despite a friendship with President Donald Trump that has helped the two countries through turbulent times.

Regardless of which candidate takes office in the U.S., we will pursue a sincere approach to improve our relations, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.

The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankaras closer ties with Moscow, its ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and an erosion of rights in Turkey.

Cavusoglu said Turkey had worked with Democrat and Republican administrations alike and overcome difficulties with both.

He spoke as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took a narrow lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia, putting the White House within Bidens reach as undecided states continued to count votes.

Washington has threatened sanctions on Turkey for purchasing Russian missile defence systems but Trumps administration has avoided imposing sanctions.

Of course, individuals have an impact, positive and negative. The sincere friendship between our president and Mr. Trump continued through the most difficult times, Cavusoglu said.

Analysts say Turkeys bilateral ties could suffer if Biden becomes U.S. president. The lira, which is already trading at a record low against the dollar, could come under more pressure.

However Erdogans top aide, Vice President Fuat Oktay, said Ankara was not afraid of sanctions.

No country, including America, has the chance to implement a foreign policy, programme or policy in the region in spite of Turkey or by excluding Turkey, Oktay told broadcaster A Haber.

Turkey is no longer a country which shrinks from, or is scared of, sanctions. Sanctions would increase further our resolve and our determination, he said.",0

The BoA confirms that ensuring security on its platforms remains a top priority for the institution. The bankâs official website points out that the the most common types of online scams are usually carried out by sending fake emails, text messages, voice calls, and letters. In some cases, there might even be someone who can show up at peopleâs homes, unexpectedly.

The BoA notes that there are many different scamming techniques that fraudsters may use. The bank goes on to list some of these techniques (which may have been used before), For instance, the scammer may tell the victim that they should not trust Bank of America, âor to respond to questions in untruthful ways.â In many cases, the fraudsters may also put a lot of pressure on people to send them money.

Scammers can also issue threats that the victim could get in trouble with law enforcement if they donât make a payment (which actually they donât even owe). Online criminals can also put pressure on people or try to convince them to buy fake gift cards and even offer them bogus codes as a form of payment.

924,"Money laundering is a very serious criminal activity.

Most people have heard of the term money laundering, but many would need a dictionary (or Wikipedia) to actually tell you what it meant.

Relative to how severe a crime it is, money laundering isnt really that complicated, and is much more prevalent than you might think.

How Does Money Laundering Work? What Even Is It?

A criminal has just inherited a large amount of money illegally. Simply depositing it into a personal or business account of his will assuredly raise suspicion at his bank. So would not claiming it on his taxes, something that might be difficult to explain to the authorities.

So, what does that criminal do with his dirty money? Clean it, of course.

Simply put: money laundering is taking illegally-obtained money and making it look like it was earned legally instead.

This is done by criminals through certain kinds of transactions, investments in assets, and other moves that hide the original source of the funds.

The end result is money that looks legal and is able to be used without raising the suspicion of authorities.

The term allegedly came from notorious mobster Al Capone, who liked to hide his illegal profits as legitimate income in the many laundromats he owned.

Today the term is something of an umbrella term to describe many different methods of deceiving the law about where money came from.

Laundering is a big problem.

In the United States alone, an estimated $300 billion is laundered annually through banks and similar institutions, which accounts for 2% of the countrys entire economy.

Globally, estimates go as high as $2 trillion, or as much as 5% of the worlds GDP.

The advent of digital banking and cash management has made moving money quickly and covertly easier than ever by criminals, making laundering one of the biggest crimes of our time. And with the rise of online gambling, there has been a huge increase in money laundering through online casinos.

The Three Steps of Laundering

Even though the practice has been around for centuries and has gotten increasingly complex, there are still just three basic steps that criminals employ to launder money: placement, layering and integration.

Once dirty money is obtained by criminals, placement is the first step.

This involves putting the funds into a bank account registered to a business (real or otherwise) or to a middleman.

This step is where most would-be launderers get caught, as putting large amounts of money into these accounts out of nowhere generally looks suspicious if not done carefully.

Next the money needs to be layered, or exchanged through multiple transactions so that its original source cant be traced.

Theres many ways that criminals tend to do this, including dispersing the funds to many different bank accounts or buying expensive assets like houses or cars.

Finally, the launderer seeks to get their now-clean money back through integration.

More transactions are made that re-direct the money back to the criminal. Sometimes this may take the form of a salary as head of a newly created business or nonprofit. Other times it may be invested in legitimate businesses, complete with fake invoices attempting to show the money was genuine income.

Ways Criminals Do It

While the basic three steps dont vary that much, theres a huge variety of ways criminals go about laundering their money.

Structuring: During the placement step, the money is broken down into several smaller deposits in order to better avoid detection.

Often this is done by way of purchasing securities like money orders that are then re-deposited again in small quantities.

Casinos and Gambling: The dirty money is converted into chips at a casino, played with for a short while, then cashed out in the form of a check.

Sometimes this is also done through fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as players play and lose a little bit, then cash out so they have a receipt to show as proof of their winnings.

Round-Tripping: Money is placed into the account of a foreign business, then received back as a tax-exempt foreign direct investment.

It can also be when two companies agree between one another to sell and then buy back an asset at the same price. Sometimes this is called a lazy susan.

Cash-Intensive Businesses: Criminal businesses that tend to receive large influxes of cash sneak in illegal money into their accounts, mixing it in with legally earned money.

Common businesses used for this method are strip clubs, casinos, and car washes (as Pacino did and also Walt and Skyler in Breaking Bad).

There are many other ways of laundering, and its a practice thats constantly evolving especially as financial transactions shift to being more digitally-based.

Detection and Punishment

In most western nations, laundering money wasnt actually a crime until the 1980s and 1990s.

Before that, governments were more likely to pin criminals with a similar crime (like tax evasion) if they were suspicious of large amounts of crime-created money being moved.

Prevention measures in many countries require all transactions over a specified amount ($10,000 in the U.S.) to be reported by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and similar.

Laws also require that banking institutions take actions to confirm the real identity of their customers and businesses. Should a transaction seem unordinary for that particular person, a suspicious activity report is often filed.

These reports usually go to a financial crimes agency or task force that analyzes the data to determine if investigative action should be taken.

Many anti-laundering recommendations are also put forth by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an international organization devoted to stopping laundering.

Punishments for laundering also vary wildly by country, especially since its often done in conjunction with another crime (like tax evasion and whatever was done to originally obtain the dirty money).

In the United States, cases that strictly involve just laundering are punishable by a maximum of 14 years in prison.

For financial institutions, even just neglecting to report activity that might be laundering can carry up to five years.

The Future of Laundering

Some of the proclaimed benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are that transactions are anonymous and not controlled or regulated by any central organization.

However, these strengths are also weaknesses in that criminals can more easily launder money via the digital currencies, which is why governments are working quickly to pass cryptocurrency regulation.

Many countries like China, Russia, Canada, and others have already passed or proposed anti-laundering laws pertaining to digital money.

As cryptocurrencies see an uptick in popularity and usage, it will be interesting to see how governments attempt to stop criminals from using them to launder money.

Somewhat ironically, the person who actually figures out how to do that will likely make a lot money.

The contents of this blog are provided as an information guide only and do not amount to legal advice. The blog seeks to raise awareness of, and educate the public on, money laundering issues in order to shine the spotlight on and prevent this criminal activity.

So.. the next time someone asks you: How does money laundering work? Youll be able to tell them its not as complicated as they might think!",0
77,"A successor to Pakistani militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was killed in a US drone strike, has been announced.

Bahawal Khan, who also goes by the name Salahuddin Ayubi, has taken command of Mullah Nazir's group, officials say.

Mullah Nazir died when two missiles struck his vehicle in the tribal area of South Waziristan on Wednesday.

He headed one of four major insurgent factions in Pakistan's north-west and was a key figure in supplying fighters and support to the Afghan Taliban.

""Ayubi, whose real name is Bahawal Khan, was appointed as top commander of the group after Nazir's funeral,"" a Pakistani intelligence official told the AFP news agency.

Clerics and tribal elders had backed the appointment, a spokesman for the militant faction told the Express Tribune newspaper.

Bahawal Khan, said to be aged 34 and an illiterate former bus driver, is a long-time close associate of Mullah Nazir, the two men having fought together alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan before the 2001 US invasion.

BBC correspondents say Bahawal Khan is seen as hot-tempered, unlike his predecessor. But he is nevertheless expected to maintain the tribal consensus that Mullah Nazir had built up to keep his power base around the town of Wana largely peaceful.

In recent years there have been divisions among Taliban militant groups based in Pakistan's tribal areas.

'Significant blow'

Mullah Nazir was one of the most high-profile insurgents killed by US drones. The faction he led straddles the border with Afghanistan.

For the Americans, he is a prized catch, as he headed one of the three major militant groups in the Waziristan region that focused their attacks on Nato-led troops in neighbouring Afghanistan, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says.

But his killing will be viewed by some as a dent in Pakistan's preparations for the departure of foreign troops from Afghanistan, our correspondent adds.

Pakistan has worked hard to maintain a crucial strategic balance in Waziristan by forging peace with militant factions focused on the Afghan insurgency rather than on targets inside Pakistan.

Mullah Nazir had formed an alliance with the government and opposed the fourth main militant faction, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has concentrated its fire inside Pakistan since 2007.

He was also seen as an enemy of militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and was praised by Pakistan for expelling Uzbek and other foreign fighters from Pakistan in that year.

Observers say there have been fears that Mullah Nazir's death could upset this delicate balance, especially if the TTP, which is linked to the Mehsud tribe, is able to force an advantage in Wana.

In recent months, the TTP has also carried out a number of attacks against the Wazir tribe in Wana, including a suicide bombing in November that injured Mullah Nazir.",0

Russian police say they have closed the case file on the country's largest tax fraud. It occurred on December 24 in 2007, when Moscow tax officials approved a same-day refund of 5.4 billion rubles -- or $230 million -- to a gang masquerading as officers of Hermitage Capital, once the largest hedge-fund manager in Russia and founded by financiers Edmond Safra and Bill Browder. Interior Ministry police claim the complex scam was pulled off by a sawmill worker and a burglar, both currently serving five-year sentences, in cahoots with four others, all of whom are now dead. One had a fatal heart attack before the crime took...

69,"Five fraudsters who offered a âgreen' tax efficient investment scheme to wealthy investors in order to steal millions from them have been ordered to pay Â£20,611,738.

The Oxbridge alumni used their former positions as a conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, a solicitor and merchant banker to persuade wealthy investors to put money into their âgreenâ investment scheme.

Investors were told their money would be spent on research and development into carbon credits, but only Â£16 million of the Â£65 million was actually spent on planting trees.

Instead the group stole Â£20 million of the investorsâ money and laundered it via bank accounts and secret trusts, spending it on luxury properties in London, Australia and Dubai as well as hidden off-shore investments. They also failed to pay around Â£6.5million in tax.

On Friday 13 December at the Old Bailey, Michael Richards, Rodney Whiston-Dew and Evdoros Demetriou have been ordered to pay Â£17.7 million collectively and if they fail to return the funds in the next three months, they face further time in jail. At an earlier hearing Robert Gold and Jonathan Anwyl were ordered to repay Â£2.64 million and Â£253,934 respectively.

Manjula Nayee of the CPS said: âThese men used their elite background to persuade people to part with their money, resulting in a huge loss to the victims and the public purse.

âSeizing these assets shows that we will do everything we can to ensure that criminals do not profit by exploiting others.â

The criminal benefit
To determine how much these men had profited from their scam âgreenâ scheme, the prosecution had to consider issues around ownership of different properties, international trusts, the corporate veil, tainted gifts as well as the effect of inflation, given the offences happened over 12 years ago.

They had laundered the proceeds internationally, hiding funds in accounts across China, the British Virgin Islands, Greece and Switzerland, which all had to be taken into consideration as part of the confiscation proceedings.

The vast amount of evidence gathered to support the case for their benefit amounts resulted in an opening argument of more than 100 pages for a heavily contested hearing which lasted two weeks.

The defence presented materials to show that each money launderer had little in the way of available assets, but the CPS was able to show these claims were false by identifying Â£20,611,738 of available assets.

Manjula Nayee continued: âIt is thanks to the dedication of every member of the prosecution team that worked on this case that, we could be confident the defendants had nowhere to hide. Now they must pay the millions they owe or face further time in jail.â

362,"China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has accused the Bank of China of money laundering, in a rare attack on one of the country's biggest state-owned enterprises. It prompted an immediate denial.

The bank said the scheme was a legitimate pilot project and described the television report as ""inaccurate and potentially misleading"".

CCTV has criticised both foreign and domestic companies, including well-known brands such as Apple and Starbucks, but has rarely pursued major state enterprises. Its 20-minute investigative package was quickly reported by other mainstream news media in China.

Under China's strict controls, individuals can only exchange $50,000 (£29,200) worth of foreign currency each year. That has left many searching for other ways to transfer their wealth. The Bank of China's You Huitong scheme helps people to send money overseas by transferring the cash in renminbi and then changing it.

The bank said in a statement  later deleted from its microblog account  that the service was part of a pilot programme in line with government policy, for people applying for immigrant investor schemes or buying property overseas.

""In the operation of this service, the Bank of China has followed relevant regulations and anti-laundering requirements and established very strict operating procedures.

""The procedures set unified and clear standards requiring proofs of the uses and sources of the money. The mentions of 'underground finance' and 'money laundering' in the reports are not based in fact."" It also noted that several commercial banks were trialling similar services in Guangdong.

Steve Tsang, head of the school of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham, said it was very unusual to see such aggressive reporting on a major state-owned enterprise (SOE) in state media.

""It is something which reflects on decisions at a very senior level,"" he said. ""I would be surprised if whoever is in charge at CCTV would have done a report like this without clearing it with the propaganda department, who would therefore have cleared it with someone even more senior.""

Making allegations of that kind against such a high-profile SOE could be seen as causing significant reputational damage to China as a whole, he noted. Even if journalists believed they had reliable sources, he said, ""if it's politically unacceptable to the leadership, you don't run it"".",1
841,"President Donald Trumpâs baseless claims that Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden are attempting to ""steal"" the election are gaining momentum on social media, plunging Facebook and Twitter into the most dangerous and volatile period since Election Day.

Goaded by prominent conservatives, Trump supporters are rallying behind election-rigging conspiracies such as #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud, even as results from battleground states put Biden on the brink of winning the presidency.

âWe expect now at this point that these narratives are going to survive the election and last for quite a long time, perhaps becoming either consolidated into existing conspiracy frameworks such as QAnon or becoming the basis of completely new conspiracy theories,â Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said in a press briefing.

QAnon manipulating voters?: Were voters manipulated by QAnon a force behind Trump's 'red wave' in 2020 election?

Twitter rules would change for Trump: Trump will be a regular citizen on Twitter when his presidency ends

âIf you look at the extent and breadth of the kind of disinformation we are seeing, it seems highly unlikely to us that this activity is going to slack off even after, say, inauguration.â

Long after the election is called, âthere will be a significant portion of people who believe the election was stolen and who will use these narratives as a basis of that belief and then will build upon it,â Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief, said.

While the volume of posts about the election is decreasing, Twitter is seeing a surge in election-related disinformation, according to Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit public interest research group which studies disinformation.

Four of the 10 most shared websites in posts about the 2020 election promoted unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud or sought to document allegations of voter fraud, the research found. #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud were among the top 10 hashtags used.

Artificial intelligence software company Yonder analyzed social media posts including the term âstop the stealâ and found that 99 of the participating accounts were created after Oct. 1 and 55 were created on Nov. 3. These new accounts dominate the volume of posts containing the term, Yonder found.

Politico reported Friday that voter fraud protests across the country are linked to major conservative activist groups and MAGA personalities such as Tea Party Patriots, Women for America First, Turning Point USA and Freedom Works USA.

Confronted with the rapid proliferation of posts and groups making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and encouraging Trump supporters to turn out at street protests, sometimes with violent overtones, Facebook responded Thursday with temporary emergency measures to restrict the spread of false and possibly dangerous content.

Facebook deployed âbreak glassâ tools to police online debate. Itâs demoting content on Facebook and Instagram, including debunked claims about voting. It is also limiting the distribution of live videos that may relate to the election.

""We have developed break-glass tools which do allow us to â if for a temporary period of time â effectively throw a blanket over a lot of content that would freely circulate on our platforms,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, told USA TODAY in September.

Earlier Thursday, Facebook shut down a fast-growing pro-Trump âStop the Stealâ group calling for ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the voteâ over âworrying calls for violence.â

The Facebook group, which attracted more than 350,000 members and nearly 7,000 posts in two days, was being used to organize protests with the rallying cry that Biden was trying to steal the election.

It was named after the hashtag weaponized by President Donald Trump and his allies to boost unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that could delegitimize a Biden win.

âIn line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group âStop the Steal,â which was creating real-world events,â Facebook said in a statement. âThe group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.â

The #StopTheSteal hashtag was used in 2016 and 2019 and reemerged again in September, but didn't gain the resonance it's experiencing now. It took off the morning of Election Day, when attached to a Twitter post showing a poll watcher wrongly barred from a polling station in Pennsylvania. It soon spread more widely with the help of conservative actor James Woods and personalities Diamond and Silk.",0
576,"Former BHS owner Dominic Chappell has been jailed for six years for evading £584,000 in taxes.

Chappell failed to pay the tax on £2.2m in income he received after buying the chain for £1 in 2015 from retail tycoon Sir Philip Green.

Meanwhile he splashed out on a luxury lifestyle which included a £90,000 yacht, a Bentley Continental car, and a Bahamas holiday.

BHS collapsed in 2016 after 88 years on the high street - with the failure costing 11,000 jobs and leaving a gaping pension deficit.

Serial bankrupt Chappell, 53, was convicted of evading VAT, corporation tax and income tax after a trial at London's Southwark crown court.

The charges related to Chappell's personal services company Swiss Rock, which was paid to facilitate the purchase of BHS by Retail Acquisitions Ltd, where he was a director.

The judge, Mr Justice Bryan, said the businessman had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"".

Chappell's lawyers had claimed Chappell was left ""utterly broke"" after the scale of BHS's pension problems ""exploded"" within two weeks of him buying BHS and that, had it not failed, he would have been able to pay the tax liability.

The businessman, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, had told the court he was ""simply too busy"" to sort out his business dealings properly and sought to blame former owner Sir Philip and auditors PwC for his misfortunes.

But the judge told him: ""You were not overwhelmed by your other pressures, and you were not too busy or under too much pressure to spare the time to buy yourself trappings of luxury with monies that would have been better deployed to pay the taxes due.""

He told Chappell that he could not ""lay all the blame"" for being left penniless ""at the door of others including Sir Philip Green"".

It is the latest court action faced by Chappell following the BHS failure.

In November 2019 he was banned from running a company for ten years and in January this year he was ordered by The Pensions Regulator to pay £9.5m into BHS's retirement schemes.

Sir Philip, the man who sold the retailer to Chappell, faced severe criticism in the wake of its collapse, with MPs branding him the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"" and calling for him to be stripped of his knighthood.

The tycoon later described the select committee findings as ""bizarre"".",1
964,"Tehran, Iran  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said it does not matter who wins a surprisingly tight US presidential election and that his country has planned for difficult conditions in the future.

In a televised speech on Wednesday, the Iranian leader said whoever the next president in Washington was, he should respect international treaties and laws.

We want to be respected, not subject to sanctions [by the US]. No matter who wins the US election What we want is for the US to return to law to return to international and multilateral accords, he said in reference to a nuclear deal Iran signed with world powers in 2015.

In May 2018, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the landmark deal and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran.

His Democratic challenger Joe Biden says he will return to the nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Iran in an effort to restart wider negotiations.

Rouhani on Wednesday said if the next US administration chooses to change course, that could change facts on the ground, but that Iran is not holding its breath and would prepare for the worst.

We have planned based on the assumption that the methods and behaviours of the US will not return to the correct approach, he said.

If the Americans come to a realisation  that they must choose another way, so much the better. But if not, our decisions are based on how to run the country if conditions are difficult.

Since abandoning the nuclear deal, Trump has followed a maximum pressure campaign that has blacklisted the entire Iranian financial sector.

The long sanctions have significantly damaged the Iranian economy, leading to sharp currency devaluation and high inflation.

Iran says it will not be pressured to renegotiate the nuclear deal and will adhere to all its commitments once the US lifts all sanctions and returns to the negotiating table.

In a speech on Tuesday, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the outcome of the US presidential elections would not affect Iranian policy towards the US.

Some people talk about what will happen if this or that one is elected. Yes, certain events may happen but they dont concern us. Our policy is calculated and clear. he said.",0
