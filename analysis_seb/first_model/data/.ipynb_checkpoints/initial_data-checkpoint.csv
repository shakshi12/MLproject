CRIMINAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Sam Waksal

CEO:Â ImClone
Convicted: October 15, 2002 of securities fraud, bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury
Known for his networking skills as much as for his scientific expertise, immunologist Sam Waksal founded ImClone in 1984. The New York-based biotech firm remained relatively unknown until 1999, when it announced the creation of Erbitux â a cancer-fighting drug so promising it convinced pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers to purchase $1 billion of ImClone stock in one of the largest biotechnology partnerships in U.S. history. But when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug, Waksal alerted several relatives and friends to dump their stock as soon as possible â before the FDA's decision had been made public. Waksal's father and daughter sold $9.2 million worth of ImClone, a move that caught the attention of the SEC and eventually led to his arrest.
Though Waksal pleaded guilty and publicly apologized to his family, his colleagues, and the millions of cancer patients who had held such high hopes for Erbitux, Judge William Pauley dismissed calls for leniency, noting that Waksal had contributed a mere one-half of 1 percent of his $133 million fortune to charity. In the end, the fallen entrepreneur paid $4.3 million in fines and tax restitution, and served 87 months in prison; he was released on Feb. 9, 2009. The scandal's most infamous casualty, however, turned out to be Waksal's pal, Martha Stewart, who had unloaded all 3,928 of her company shares just days before the FDA's decision had been announced to avoid losing an estimated $45,673; the domestic diva got five months in prison as a result.",am

One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.

Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265bn) of investors' money at Capital Group.

BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.

Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.

The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.

Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.

""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.

Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.

This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.

Leaked documents

The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.

It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.

Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.

Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.

In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.

An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.

Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.

""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""

The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.

'Complied with duties'

Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.

""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""

Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.

However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.

Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.

The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.

Controversial energy deal

Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.

However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.

Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.

Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.

Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.

Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.",am

3,"WASHINGTON (AP) â An American security contractor is accusing two top-ranking Congolese officials of ordering his detention and torture, declaring in a lawsuit that they demanded he confess falsely to being part of a plot to overthrow the countryâs government.

Darryl Lewis, an Air Force veteran, said in an Associated Press interview this week that he was illegally held in Congoâs capital, Kinshasa, for nearly six weeks and interrogated for as much as 16 hours a day by members of Congoâs national intelligence agency.

Congoâs intelligence chief, Kalev Mutond, and Congolese Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, âacted in concertâ to have him detained, tortured and âthreatened with indefinite imprisonment on false charges,â according to the lawsuit, filed July 29 in federal court in Washington.

âI feared for my life from the day they captured me,â Lewis, 48, said. He said he never confessed.

Congoâs ambassador, Francois Balumuene, said in a statement Thursday that Lewis was detained because he did not have the proper work permit. He denied Lewis had been mistreated and called his lawsuit âunsubstantiated allegations.â

Law enforcement authorities in Congo released Lewis on June 8 after âextensive diplomatic efforts and negotiations,â the lawsuit said. Lewis is seeking at least $4.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

The lawsuit comes amid mounting tensions ahead of November presidential elections in Congo. Opposition leaders claim that President Joseph Kabila wants to delay the vote so he can stay in power past his mandate that expires at the end of the year. The countryâs constitution bars Kabila from running for a third term.

Congoâs relations with Washington have frayed over the last year due to repeated reports that Kabilaâs government has cracked down on political foes and activists. The U.S. Treasury Department in June sanctioned a top Congolese police official who activists say is linked to dozens of deaths. The departmentâs statement announcing the sanctions against Celestin Kanyama noted a âpattern of repressionâ by Kabilaâs government.

Lewis had been working as an unarmed security adviser for Moise Katumbi, Congoâs leading opposition candidate for president. Katumbi, one of Kabilaâs harshest critics, has been charged separately by authorities in Congo with hiring mercenaries. Katumbi and his supporters have denied the allegation and say the move is aimed at derailing his bid for the presidency.

In the lawsuit, Mwamba is described as being convinced that Lewis and hundreds of other U.S. citizens had infiltrated Congo since last October to help Katumbi overthrow the government and assassinate Kabila. Lewisâ military background made him especially suspect. At a May 4 press conference, Mwamba displayed as evidence a photo of Lewis holding a large machine gun.

Lewis said the photo was taken in 2009 when he was working as a contractor in Kosovo. Congolese authorities must have pulled it from his LinkedIn account, he said. The photo has since been replaced with another of Lewis.

Mwamba declined to comment on the specifics of Lewisâ lawsuit. âA Congolese who would be found to have acted in the U.S. as Lewis did in the (Congo) surely would have to explain himself before the FBI and other authorities,â he said.

The lawsuit said Lewis and three colleagues were âstopped and surroundedâ by Congolese riot police on April 24 as they were driving near a political rally that Katumbi had attended in the city of Lubumbashi. They were unarmed and breaking no laws, according to Lewis. He was the only American in the group.

Soon, several members of Congoâs intelligence agency, who were not named in the suit, arrived. They handcuffed and physically assaulted Lewis and his colleagues. At one point, a car door was slammed into his elbow, the lawsuit said.

Lewis said they were taken to a âfilthy, unsanitaryâ jail in Lubumbashi and put in separate cells. He was assaulted and abused, according to the lawsuit. His bound hands were pulled up behind his back, creating painful pressure on his shoulder joints. During the night, Lewis could hear his captors âbrutally beatâ and interrogate one of his colleagues. âYouâre next,â Lewis said he was warned.

The next day Lewis was transported to the intelligence agencyâs headquarters in Kinshasa. Over the next six weeks, he was questioned for long periods and deprived of sleep, according to the lawsuit. His captors gave him just one small meal a day. Lewis said his captors also began a series of âmind games,â such as using information about his ailing mother, to wear him down and secure a confession.

Lewis was not charged with a crime before he was released.",am
4,"A senior figure in the Bitcoin Foundation, which lobbies on behalf of the digital currency has been arrested for conspiracy to commit money laundering and âknowingly contributingâ to anonymous drug sales.

Prosecutors announced on Monday that Charlie Shrem, the organisation's vice chairman, was arrested at John F Kennedy airport in New York on New York Sunday.

The news comes as a major blow for the digital currency lobby group and its supporters including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The twins, famous for the early involvement with Facebook, have become big backers of the digital currency. They said in a statement on Monday that they were âdeeply concernedâ by the news.

A second man, Robert Faiella, has also been arrested and charged for the same crimes relating to his operation of a small bitcoin exchange under the name BTCKing.

The charges, unsealed by the US attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, accuse the pair of ""engaging in a scheme to sell over $1m in bitcoins to users of Silk Road"", the online black marketplace which was closed by the FBI in October 2013.

Shrem has been one of the highest profile executives on the Bitcoin Foundation. His arrest comes as staff at the foundation have been working hard to distance the digital currency from its links to crime, testifying to the US Senate last year and been lobbying regulators in Washington. Patrick Murck, Bitcoinâs general counsel, said: âI donât think itâs damaging for the Foundation. [The] foundation wasnât involved in any of the allegations.â

James Hunt, an agent at the US drug enforcement administration agent, said in a statement: ""The charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way.""

The charges stem from Shrem's ownership of the BitInstant bitcoin exchange, of which he is the chief executive, co-founder and compliance officer. The exchange hit the headlines in May 2013 when the Winklevoss twins led a seed round which raised $1.5m of investment. The timing of the charges is unfortunate for the Winklevoss brothers who are set to speak this week at a two-day conference on digital currencies held by New York state's department of financial services.

In a statement the twins said: âWhen we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws â including money laundering laws â and we expected nothing less. Although BitInstant is not named in todayâs indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest. We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.â

Shrem is additionally charged with ""wilfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding Faiella's illegal transactions through the company,"" the documents reveal.

âAs alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1m in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics onï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ the dark web drug site, Silk Road,"" said Bharara. ""Truly innovative business models donât need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.â

The substance of the allegation is that Faiella offered bitcoins for sale on the Silk Road website, a move which would entail knowing of their involvement in the drugs trade. Those bitcoins were purchased from the Bitinstant exchange.

Shrem, as the compliance officer of the exchange, was in charge of ensuring its compliance of anti-money laundering rules.

The charges, delivered by an IRS agent who was assigned to the New York organised crime drug enforcement strike force, allege that ""not only did Shrem knowingly allow Faiella to use the company's services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers, he personally processed Faiella's transactions, gave Faiella discounts on his high-volume orders, wilfully failed to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella and deliberately helped Faiella circumvent the company's [anti-money-laundering] restrictions, even though it was Shrem's job to enforce them.""

In December 2013, Shrem was profiled by news website Vocativ in a piece titled "" My Night Out With Bitcoin Millionaire and Proud Stoner Charlie Shrem"". In it, Shrem tells reporter Eric Markowitz that ""I wonât hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with you"", and says that he was forced to temporarily close BitInstant several times due to increased regulatory scrutiny. ""If we want to exist 20 years from now, we want to make sure all of our ducks are in a row,â he tells Markowitz, âand right now, theyâre not.""

The Winklevoss brothers' investment in BitInstant is just a small part of their total investment in bitcoin and related companies. Following the news of Shrem and Faiella's arrest, the price of bitcoin on the Mtgox exchange dropped by 3%.",am
5,"Rohan Marley is not charged with wrongdoing. (Photo: AP)

Among recent enforcement actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission shut down a $78 million pump-and-dump scheme involving a coffee company with ties to the late reggae great Bob Marley.

In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Deutsche Bank Securities $1.4 million on short interest reporting failures and fined Signator Investors $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding consolidated reports.

SEC Investigating Pump-and-Dump of Marley Coffee Stock

The SEC charged several individuals in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the stock of the stock of Jamminâ Java, a company that operates as Marley Coffee and uses trademarks of late reggae artist Bob Marley to sell coffee products.

According to the agency, Jamminâ Javaâs former CEO Shane Whittle put together the scheme with the aid of three individuals living abroad and the offshore entities they control. Whittle utilized a reverse merger to secretly gain control of millions of Jamminâ Java shares, and he spread the stock to the offshore entities controlled by Wayne Weaver of the U.K. and Canada, Michael Sun of India and RenÃ© Berlinger of Switzerland.

Charged with fraudulently promoting Jamminâ Java stock to investors are British twin brothers Alexander and Thomas Hunter, who were previously charged in a separate SEC case for touting multiple penny stocks using a fake stock picking robot. Others charged in the SECâs complaint with pushing the illegal offering through their offshore entities are U.K. citizens Stephen Wheatley and Kevin Miller and Oman resident Mohammed Al-Barwani.

Stock promoter Whittle befriended Rohan Marley â a son of Bob Marley â in Los Angeles. When he learned that Marley had bought a small Jamaican coffee farm, Whittle proposed the creation of a large-scale coffee distribution business built on the Marley name.

To raise capital for the venture, Whittle identified publicly traded shell company Global Electronic Recovery Corp. (GERC), which was a purported waste management business in Los Angeles. He executed a reverse merger between GERC and Marley Coffee, which later became Jamminâ Java and trades under the ticker symbol JAMN. In connection with the reverse merger, Whittle secretly gained control of millions of shares that previously had been issued to foreign nominees.

Using his access and control of Jamminâ Java and its stock, Whittle and others put together an illegal offering and the fraudulent promotion of Jamminâ Javaâs stock in a pump-and-dump scheme that culminated in the middle of 2011. In anticipation of the promotion, Whittle distributed some of the nominee stock to offshore entities controlled by Weaver, Sun and Berlinger.

To boost the stock price and provide cash to Jamminâ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun and Berlinger created a fake financing arrangement to make it look as if there were legitimate third-party interest and investment in the company. Jamminâ Javaâs announcement of the financing agreement and other company announcements, along with coordinated trading by entities connected to the scheme, boosted the stock price.

Whittle hid his control of the stock and other aspects of the scheme, lying in beneficial ownership reports that he filed with the SEC. He also distributed another large block of stock to offshore entities, including those controlled or owned by Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller and Al-Barwani. Whittle, Weaver, Sun, and Berlinger hid their beneficial ownership of Jamminâ Java stock.

The Hunters published false stock newsletters and took other actions to raise the stockâs price; then, when the price was up, the defendants and others coordinating with them dumped 45 million shares on the public market without registering the transactions, making at least $78 million in illicit profits. Weaver, Sun and Berlinger funneled $2.5 million in profits to Jamminâ Java under the guise of the phony financing arrangement that launched the promotion.

Jamminâ Javaâs share price and volume began to collapse a few days after the company disclosed on May 9, 2011, that it became aware of an unauthorized and unaffiliated online stock promotion. Disappointing financial results in its annual report took the price down even more.

Marley was not accused of wrongdoing.

Jamminâ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller, Al-Barwani and the Hunter brothers face various charges. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars against all of the individuals and an officer-and-director bar against Whittle.

Deutsche Bank Securities Hit by FINRA for $1.4 Million

FINRA has fined Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. $1.4 million for violations of the short interest reporting rule and related supervisory failures.

According to the agency, for more than 10 years, Deutsche Bank has been improperly including securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate in numerous aggregation units when determining each unitâs net position.

Firms are generally allowed to track their positions in a security from certain trading operations or trading desks separately from other positions maintained at the firm through the use of an âaggregation unit.â But in determining the net positions of aggregation units, firms cannot include the securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate. In addition, FINRA requires firms, with some exceptions, to regularly report their total âshortâ positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts in equity securities. These short positions must be reported on a gross, rather than a net basis.

But from April 2004 to September 2012, Deutsche Bank reported the netted positions in its financial aggregation account as the firmâs short interest positions for that particular day.

FINRA also found that, during the period when the violations occurred, Deutsche Bankâs supervisory system, with respect to its aggregation unit structure and short interest reporting, was not designed to detect and prevent them.

The firm neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the sanctions.

FINRA Censures, Fines Signator Investors $450,000

FINRA censured Signator Investors Inc. and fined it $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding registered representativesâ use of consolidated reports. In addition, Gregory Joseph Mitchell was assessed a deferred fine of $10,000 and suspended from association with any FINRA member in any supervisory capacity for seven months.

According to the agency, Mitchell failed to enforce the firmâs policies and procedures related to client file reviews and branch audits by providing advance notice of which client files would be reviewed, as well as advance notice of unannounced branch audits to registered representatives. In addition, despite being reprimanded by the firmâs director of compliance for surveillance, Mitchell continued to notify registered representatives in advance which files would be reviewed, and the firm did nothing to stop him.

The firm made a consolidated reporting system available to its registered representatives that allowed the representatives to enter customized values for assets and accounts held away from the firm into a consolidated report. However, the firm not only lacked an adequate supervisory system to review those reports, including the accuracy of manually entered valuations provided to the customers, but its procedures never mentioned either supervising consolidated reports or how to use the system â in fact, there was no review process for consolidated reports; as a result, the firmâs supervisors didnât even know who was responsible for reviewing the reports.

FINRA found other procedural failures, including failure to adequately review incoming and outgoing correspondence, failure to maintain consolidated reports that were sent to its customers and failures in its written supervisory procedures regarding its client file review and branch audit programs.",am

The forex company Khanani and Kalia (Kand K) directors Hanif S Kali, Abdul Munaf Kalia, Javed Khanani, Altaf Khanani, Atif Aziz Polani, Abdul Aziz Polani, Javed Qasim, Amir Zakaria, Iqbal Kasbati were acquitted by the trial court on October 29, 2013. They were booked by the FIA on a complaint of the State Bank of Pakistan for running illegal foreign exchange company and parallel banking channel.

According to the FIA case, the K&K directors illegally transacted foreign exchange worth billions of US dollars in collusion with different exchange companies, money changers and businessmen. The FIA alleged that the defendants fraudulently created replica website clik.pk.net without informing the SBP to illegally transfer money from and outside Pakistan. They also set up offices at foreign destinations and appointed Atif Polani and Javed Qasim as focal persons to execute the illegal transactions.

The K&K directors were alleged to have received amounts from overseas Pakistanis through foreign exchange companies for remitting it to the country, but instead of transferring the amount to Pakistan through authorized banks duly declared by the SBP, they would retain the amount abroad or transfer it to any foreign currency account opened in collusion with persons to conceal the remittance. The prosecution alleged that the defendants held the foreign currency and did not sell or declare it to the SBP while equivalent amount payable against the remittance was distributed in Pakistan to the recipients depriving Pakistan of remittances worth billions of US dollars. They were also charged with manipulating the foreign exchange in favour of different foreign companies as Hawala transfer at the behest of businessmen to meet the under invoiced amount required to be paid illegally to foreign exporters with misdeclared exports to evade the import duty and taxes and obtained commission for these services.

The counsel for defendants Shaukat Hayat and Hummal Zubedi submitted that the banking court had already acquitted the defendants on similar charges and they could not be tried on the same offence.

7,"A Colombian who was one of the top financial managers and supervised money-laundering for a cocaine cartel accused of smuggling $10 billion in drugs into the U.S. was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in federal prison.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, 39, pleaded guilty in January to drug trafficking and obstruction of justice charges, the latter involving his role in setting up the torture, killing and dismemberment a cartel associate suspected of cooperating with authorities. In a brief statement, Montoya expressed remorse.

""There is no justification for what I did,"" Montoya said through a Spanish interpreter.

Montoya is the brother of the purported mastermind of Colombia's North Valley cartel. Diego Montoya Sanchez is also in U.S. custody in Miami and has pleaded not guilty to a 12-count federal indictment charging cocaine trafficking, money laundering, witness retaliation and obstruction of justice. Another brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, is serving a 22-year prison sentence in the U.S. his role in the drug cartel.

The Montoyas are accused of overseeing a cocaine empire that smuggled cocaine into the U.S. beginning in the 1990s. U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga set a July 10 hearing to consider whether Montoya can pay restitution to the U.S. government for his drug activities.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis said most of Montoya's assets have been seized by the Colombian government and that the additional time is needed to determine how much he could pay.

Eugenio Montoya, who has been cooperating with U.S. authorities, previously admitted his role as a top financial manager of the cartel. Among his duties was handling a series of so-called ""stash houses"" in Colombia where about $20 million in U.S. currency was hidden. Montoya also made numerous real estate investments and oversaw a computer equipment business.

Testified about torture
The obstruction charge stems from the August 2003 killing of Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, known as ""Dos Mil,"" whose main job was handling pagers and cell phones for the Montoya organization. According to court documents, Garcia was tortured at a farm outside Cali, Colombia, on orders from Diego Montoya to find out if he had talked with U.S. officials during a visit to South Florida.

""Methods used included hitting Garcia Giraldo with baseball bats in the shins and other parts of the body, holding his head under water, and asphyxiating him with a plastic bag over his head,"" according to a statement of facts signed by Eugenio Montoya.

Although Garcia denied being an informant, he was beaten to death and dismembered, his body parts thrown in a river.",am
8,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero, a major Mexican narcotics trafficker and fugitive from U.S. justice for his role in the murder of an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Caro Quintero was identified as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) in 2000. Each entity designated today is owned or controlled by one or more individuals previously designated because they act on behalf of Caro Quintero.

âTodayâs designation demonstrates the enormous extent to which Rafael Caro Quintero and his family members have infiltrated the economy in Guadalajara, Mexico, including the real estate and gasoline retail sectors,â said Treasuryâs Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. âWith Caro Quintero on the run, OFAC will continue to work with the DEA and our Mexican counterparts to expand the sanctions against any person or entity that acts on behalf of this murderous criminal.â

Caro Quintero began his criminal career in the late 1970s when he co-founded the Guadalajara drug cartel and amassed an illicit fortune. Caro Quintero was the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of DEA Special Agent (SA) Enrique Camarena in 1985. Following his capture in the same year, Caro Quintero was convicted in Mexico for his involvement in SA Camarenaâs murder and received a 40-year prison sentence. However, on August 9, 2013, Caro Quintero was released from a Mexican prison with 12 years remaining on his sentence.

âWe are reminded every day of the ultimate sacrifice paid by Special Agent Enrique Camarena and DEA will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro Quintero faces justice in the United States for the crimes he committed,â said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. âCaro Quintero and his organization can no longer hide behind front companies with their drug trafficking profits. These illegal enterprises fuel the drug trade and its violence and corruption. DEA and our partners at Treasury and elsewhere in government will pursue any and all means available to ensure that Caro Quintero is brought to justice and his criminal network is destroyed.â

While in prison, Caro Quintero continued his alliance with Mexican drug trafficking organizations and used a network of family members and front persons to invest his illicit fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. OFAC designated 18 of these individuals, including six of Caro Quinteroâs family members, and 15 entities on June 12, 2013.

Caro Quintero is wanted in the Central District of California on criminal charges related to the kidnapping and murder of SA Camarena as well as drug trafficking. The U.S. government is seeking Caro Quinteroâs arrest to face these charges.

Todayâs action, which designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero pursuant to the Kingpin Act, generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these designees, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

This action targeted 20 companies primarily located in or near Guadalajara. Several of these companies are engaged in real estate activities, including Arrendadora Turin, Barsat, and Villas del Colli. Others are gasoline retailers or engaged in agricultural activities, including Petro London, Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, and Minerales Nueva Era, which produces and sells an organic fertilizer known as Diatomag as well as an organic pesticide known as Diatomkill.

Also designated today is Juan Carlos Soto Ruiz, a Guadalajaran native who plays a key management role in six of the companies designated today, including Arrendadora Turin and Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, as well as three of the companies designated on June 12, 2013, including Pronto Shoes (a.k.a. CX-Shoes).

Since June 2000, the President has identified 103 drug kingpins, and OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals, pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation, to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

The incident took place at the start of 2015, when the hacker breached Mossack Fonseca, a corporate consultancy and law firm located in Panama.

The person(s) behind the leak took the data, consisting of 2.6TB, over 11.5 million files, and offered it for analysis to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung.

It took over 400 journalists to analyze the leaked documents

The German newspaper was so overwhelmed by the data it had to analyze that it called for the help of US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), who coordinated the investigation by distributing the documents for analysis to over 400 journalists in 107 news organizations.

Leaked data contained scanned and electronic documents from the 1970s, when Mossack Fonseca started, and up to early 2015.

During their investigation, journalists had to use special software to index and analyze the data. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software was used to transform scan documents to electronic versions so they could be indexed and categorized for easier searching and analysis.

After a monumental work, yesterday, on April 3, 2016, ICIJ, together with SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, revealed their first analysis of the leaked documents, which only included data from 149 files of the total of 11.5 million.

From the currently leaked documents, it appears that some of the world's richest persons, some of whom were politicians and even head of states, used Mossack Fonseca to set up shell corporations in various tax havens around the globe and avoid paying taxes back home.

The data breach has its own name: Panama Papers

The leak, which is now known as the Panama Papers, has its own website where ICIJ says its journalists will start publishing new documents from now on, just as Edward Snowden uses The Intercept website and Julian Assange uses WikiLeaks.

Last Friday, probably after being contacted by members of the press for a request for comment, Mossack Fonseca sent an email to its clients acknowledging the breach of an email server.

Edward Snowden described Panama Papers on Twitter as the ""biggest leak in the history of data journalism.""

A who's who of world politics

Incriminated politicians and world figures include President of Argentina Mauricio Macri, former Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina Ivanishvili, Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur DavÃ­Ã° Gunnlaugsson, UAE President & Abu Dhabi emir Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, King of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, Ex-Prime Minister of Iraq Ayad Allawi, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, convicted former Ukraine Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, former President of Sudan Ahmad Ali al-Mirghani, and several others.

Additionally, there is the daughter of former Chinese Premier Li Xiaolin, Azerbaijan's first family, several FIFA officials, soccer star Lionel Messi, several musicians, childhood friends of Russian President Putin, cousins of Syrian President Bashar Assad, father of current British prime minister, and many other more. Honestly, the list could go on for at least a few more paragraphs.

Besides these high-profile names, the leaked documents also contain documents such as email chains, invoices, and money transfers for offshore companies that facilitated bribery, arms deals, tax evasion, financial fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and all sorts of other crimes.

Panama Papers is the biggest data leak ever

The Panama Papers incident is technically the world's biggest data leak, dwarfing WikiLeaks, which was only 0.06% of its size.

ICIJ investigators say the data leak included 4.8 million emails, 3 million database files, 2,15 million PDF files, 1.1 million photos, and 0.32 million text files.

Both SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ are running separate sites for the Panama Papers leak, which you should definitely follow from now on.

12,"Key Points

Unlike victims of Bernie Madoff, who have gotten back large chunks of their principal, 18,000 customers of fraudster R. Allen Stanford have recovered practically nothing.
The Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Stanford's operations 10 years ago this week. As with Madoff, the SEC missed warning signs of the fraud for years.
The Stanford scam, second only to Madoff's in size, involved billions in fraudulent certificates of deposit.

Ten years after the second biggest investor fraud in U.S. history, victims of the $8 billion Ponzi scheme run by disgraced financier R. Allen Stanford have recovered practically nothing, court records show.

That's in stark contrast to the substantial recoveries on behalf of victims of the Bernard Madoff scam, which became public two months earlier.

The difference has enraged Stanford's victims â many of whom were retirees who had been sold ""safe"" investments â and has some lawmakers still calling for reforms.

""The only true justice Stanford's victims could ever see is in getting their savings back,"" said Angela Shaw, whose family lost millions in the collapse. ""Sadly, all they have seen and can expect to see is a few pennies on the dollar.""

A group of U.S. House members is preparing to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to step up its efforts to aid the victims, according to a draft letter obtained by CNBC.

In February 2009, the SEC was already under scrutiny for its mishandling of the Madoff case, which broke two months earlier. With the financial crisis in full swing, speculation was swirling around Stanford, a Texas billionaire who had built a sprawling financial empire on his offshore bank in Antigua. Stanford, who referred to himself as ""Sir"" Allen Stanford after receiving a knighthood from the tiny Caribbean nation, styled himself as an international man of mystery who promoted the game of cricket and just might be a CIA operative (he was not).

'Massive' fraud

On Feb. 17, 2009, the SEC and FBI agents raided Stanford's Houston headquarters, shutting down the Stanford Financial Group's worldwide operations. In a civil complaint, the SEC accused Stanford and his associates of running a ""massive, ongoing fraud"" based on certificates of deposit issued by Stanford International Bank in Antigua and sold to investors by Stanford's U.S.-based brokerage arm. While Stanford claimed the CDs were backed by solid assets and posted returns that consistently beat the market, the SEC alleged the entire operation was a fraud that financed Stanford's lavish lifestyle.

A subsequent report by the SEC inspector general found that, as in the Madoff case, the agency had missed warning signs of the scandal for years. In the case of Stanford, according to the report, the missteps went back more than a decade to 1997. And the report found the agency's investigations were hampered by a regional enforcement official who would go on to do legal work for the firm.

Stanford, a former health club operator and insurance salesman from rural Texas who once falsely claimed to be related to the founder of Stanford University, insisted his businesses were legitimate. He alleged the SEC was scapegoating him following its mishandling of the Madoff investigation.

""Madoff comes along, well, they need somebody to make an example out of,"" he told CNBC in 2009.

But a federal jury in Houston disagreed, convicting Stanford in 2012 on 13 felony counts. Now 68, he is serving a 110-year sentence at a high security prison in Florida. But none of that â or the fact that Stanford was ordered to forfeit some $5.9 billion in cash that has long since been spent â is any solace to Stanford's 18,000 investors.

According to the most recent figures from Ralph Janvey, the court-appointed receiver rounding up funds for the victims, about $500 million of the roughly $5 billion in investor losses had been recovered as of Oct. 31, 2018. Of that, a court has approved about $224 million in fees and expenses for Janvey and his team. That leaves about $275 million â or about 5 cents on the dollar â for the victims.

An attorney for Janvey, Kevin Sadler, said the receivership has recovered about $200 million more since that report, including about $63 million in a settlement with Stanford's former law firm. And Janvey is still trying to recover hundreds of millions more in lawsuits against those who allegedly received fraudulent transfers from Stanford, including members of Stanford's sales force.

Other funds are in limbo, including some $160 million in Stanford's Swiss bank of choice, Societe Generale. That money was to be returned to investors under a settlement between U.S. and Antiguan regulators, but the bank has blocked its release.

Contrast to Madoff

Even if all of Janvey's efforts are successful, Stanford's investors are likely to receive only pennies on the dollar, while Madoff investors have recovered about 75 cents on the dollar in principal â and counting. Sadler said the difference is the result of different treatment of the two frauds by the agencies that normally look out for investors.

""Sadly, unlike in the Madoff case, Stanford investors were not eligible for SIPC coverage for their losses,"" Sadler told CNBC in an email. He was referring to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which compensates investors for securities and cash that are lost when a brokerage firm fails.

In the case of Madoff, SIPC oversaw the liquidation of the firm, made payments to thousands of investors, and covered the fees of court-appointed trustee Irving Picard. But in the case of Stanford, whose U.S. brokerage arm was a SIPC member, the agency argued that the securities in question â bogus CDs issued by a foreign bank â were not covered under the law. Thus, neither were the victims.

Sadler also noted that the Justice Department has recovered some $8 billion for Madoff victims through criminal prosecutions, including a $2 billion settlement with Madoff's primary bank, JPMorgan Chase. But in the Stanford case, prosecutors only targeted individuals.

Stanford and two of his of his top lieutenants â Mark Kuhrt and Gilberto Lopez â were convicted at trial. Two others, Chief Financial Officer James Davis and Chief Investment Officer Laura Pendergest-Holt, pleaded guilty. A sixth individual, Antiguan banking regulator Leroy King, has thus far successfully fought extradition.

""The cleanup efforts for the Stanford and Madoff frauds are routinely compared, but there is no question that the absence of both SIPC coverage and any multibillion-dollar U.S. DOJ recoveries for Stanford victims accounts for the substantial difference between distributions to the Madoff and Stanford victims,"" Sadler said.

But Shaw also blames Janvey, and the professionals he hired, for ""spending 50 cents for every dollar they've recovered."" And she says the SEC ""botched"" a lawsuit aimed at forcing SIPC to compensate the victims.

""The list is shockingly exhaustive with failure at every turn,"" she said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., introduced legislation last year that would have allowed the SEC to take over the Stanford receivership and distribute funds to investors, but the proposal went nowhere.

For his part, Stanford has not given up trying to clear his name. Acting as his own attorney, he has cranked out a steady stream of court filings from prison, none with any success. In the most recent petition, filed in December, Stanford demands to be allowed to question Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was FBI director during Stanford's prosecution, over alleged mishandling of evidence.

The court has yet to rule on his motion.",am
13,"As Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross may have a lower profile than some of Donald Trumpâs other cabinet secretaries, but he is no less corrupt and unqualified for his position.

Ross has invested heavily in and even served as Vice Chair of Bank of Cyprus, known for its connections to Russian money laundering and oligarchs.

He has business ties to Vladimir Putinâs inner circle; Rossâ investment firm has a 31.5% stake in a British ship-charter company, whose client is a Russian energy giant owned by Putinâs son-in-law and friend. Rossâ investment firm raised $500 million from the Chinese government.

14,"Two former prime ministers in Algeria have gone on trial on corruption charges, in the most high-profile act of transparency and accountability since a pro-democracy movement pushed out the long-serving president.

The exceptional trial, which is being televised and also involves several other former Algerian power players, comes at a time of renewed political tensions in the oil and gas-rich country, a week in advance of a controversial election to replace President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

Ahmed Ouyahia, who was forced out as prime minister in March as protests against Bouteflika escalated, and his predecessor Abdelmalek Sellal, testified Wednesday at the Sidi MâHamed court in Algiers.

The accused face charges ranging from money laundering to abuse of office and granting undue privileges in the vehicle assembly industry.

Lawyer Mohamed Madjdoub, speaking on behalf of the defence, told the judge that âconditions â¦ do not allow for lawyers to accomplish their mission and therefore, I inform you that the defence has decided to boycott the trialâ.

The judge asked the lawyers to leave the small, crowded courtroom and said the proceedings would continue.

The nascent Algerian automotive sector got its start in 2014, via partnerships between foreign groups and large Algerian corporations, often owned by businessmen linked to Bouteflikaâs entourage.

Setting a precedent

It is the first time since Algeriaâs independence from France in 1962 that former prime ministers have been put on trial.

The two men argued that the court was not competent to try them, the constitution stipulating that crimes and infractions committed by prime ministers while in office fell under a âHigh Court of Stateâ.

But the organic law to establish this court was not passed and the prosecutor responded that they had to answer for their actions before the ordinary court.

Called first to the stand, Ouyahia was accused of âmisappropriation of public funds, abuse of office, granting undue privileges, conflict of interest, corruption, money laundering and false statementsâ.

He was charged with favouring certain manufacturers in the automotive sector â even if they did not fulfil brief specifications â to the detriment of competitors.

âThere is no misappropriation (of public funds) and the choice â¦ was based on the market. These manufacturers were already present and we wanted to keep them,â the former prime minister said in his defence.

Former ministers Bedda Mahdjoub (industry and mines), Youcef Yousfi, who succeeded him in the post, and Abdelghani Zaalane (public works and transport) are other defendants in the case.

Also standing trial was Ali Haddad, former head of the main Algerian employer organisation, the Forum of Business Leaders (FCE).

The 54-year-old businessman is also the founder and CEO of private construction firm ETRHB.

Among the other businessmen being tried is former FCE vice president Mohamed Bairi, CEO of the Ival group, which owns industrial vehicle plant Iveco.

Ahmed Mazouz, president of the eponymous group that assembles and distributes Chinese-brand vehicles in Algeria, and Hassane Arbaoui, head of Global Group which runs an Algerian factory for South Korean company Kia, are also defendants.

Key issue

Algerian authorities are hoping the trial helps convince the public that they are serious about fighting corruption and reforming themselves â and persuade them to go out and vote next week.

Corruption is a key issue for Algeriaâs peaceful, 9-month-old protest movement, which considers the election a sham because itâs organised by the existing power structure. Protesters want a whole new political system instead.

âOnly the people can judge whether we have the will to combat corruption,â Justice Minister Belkacem Zeghmati told legislator before the trial, describing the alleged corruption as âgoing beyond all comprehension.â

Bouteflika, whose health condition has remained a mystery since a 2013 stroke, has not been seen in public since he left power. Jeune Afrique magazine reported that he is staying in his home in Zeralda under full-time medical care.",am
15,"Cyber-attacks have been levied against journalists in Angola after they reported that the Angolan presidentâs chief of staff had embezzled public funds.

Independent online news provider Correio Angolense published an article online covering the claims against Edeltrudes Costa that were first made by the Portuguese TV channel TelevisÃ£o Independente (TVI).

The broadcaster launched an investigation after companies owned by Costa were awarded several major contracts by the government, including a multi-million-dollar contract to renovate Angolaâs airports. TVI alleged that Costa transferred public money paid to his businesses to offshore accounts in Panama and Portugal, then used it to acquire luxury properties.

Shortly after Correio Angolense covered the allegations, the website of the news provider was hit by a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. As a result, the website has been inaccessible since September 25.

Its editor, GraÃ§a Campos, told Reporters Without Borders (RSF) that the site was crashed by thousands of simultaneous connection attempts in what appeared to be a deliberate cyber-attack.

RSFâs former Angola correspondent, freelance journalist Siona Casimiro, was also the target of a cyber-attack after he worked on the Costa embezzlement story.

Casimiro told RSF: âThere can be no doubt about the desire to silence journalists with regard to the Edeltrudes Costa affair.â

Combatting corruption has been one of President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§oâs key pledges since his election in 2017. When news of Costaâs alleged crime broke, around 200 people took to the streets of the nationâs capital Luanda to protest and call for the chief of staffâs resignation.

LourenÃ§oâs campaign against corruption led to the imprisonment in August of JosÃ© Filomeno dos Santos, son of Angolaâs former president JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos, who served as the countryâs head of state from 1979 to 2017. JosÃ© Filomeno was sentenced to five years in prison after diverting oil revenues from Angolaâs sovereign wealth fund, which he oversaw from 2013 to 2018.

An investigation is ongoing into the activities of his half-sister Isabel dos Santos, who, according to Africa News, is suspected of âa long list of crimes including mismanagement, embezzlement and money laundering during her stewardship of state oil giant Sonangol.â",am
16,"ATLANTA - Mitzi Bickers has been arraigned on 11 federal charges including conspiring to commit bribery, wire fraud, money-laundering, federal obstruction and tax fraud. Bickers was indicted by a federal grand jury on March 27, 2018.

âCity of Atlanta contracts always should go to the most qualified bidder through a contracting process that is fair and transparent,â said U.S. Attorney Byung J. âBJayâ Pak. âInstead, Mitzi Bickers allegedly conspired to use her influence as a high-ranking City of Atlanta official and later as a connected political consultant to steer lucrative city contracts to Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr., Charles P. Richards, Jr., and their companies through bribery. The illicit arrangement netted over $2 million in bribes for Bickers and almost $17 million in city contracts for Mitchell and Richards, and has shaken the publicâs trust in the cityâs contracting process.â

âThe actions of Bickers, alleged in this indictment, traded the publicâs trust in a fair bidding process for personal gain,â said David J. LeValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. âThe FBI and its partners in law enforcement will not tolerate those who choose to try to influence established and proper government procedures.â

âPublic officials need to be reminded of the trust and duty bestowed upon them by the taxpayers to serve the publicâs interest not their own,â said Thomas J. Holloman, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation. âWhen public officials and those seeking to do business with them break this trust by committing fraud, they will be charged to the fullest extent of the law.â

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: As the City of Atlantaâs Director of Human Services and after leaving employment with the city, Bickers allegedly conspired with contractors Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr. and Charles P. Richards, Jr. to accept bribe payments for herself and other public officials in exchange for the her agreement to obtain city contracts for Mitchellâs and Richardsâ companies. Both Mitchell and Richards have pleaded guilty to paying bribes to Bickers and are currently serving federal prison sentences for their crimes.

In 2009, Bickers worked on the mayoral campaign and began working for the City of Atlanta after the election. From February 2010 to May 22, 2013, Bickers served as the City of Atlantaâs Director of Human Services. Beginning in 2010, Mitchell and Richards agreed to pay bribes to Bickers to secure profitable City of Atlanta contracts for their businesses. At times, the bribe payments allegedly were referred to as âup-front money.â In reality, Mitchell and Richards often paid Bickers when their companies actually received City of Atlanta contract work.

In exchange for the bribe payments, Bickers promised to represent Mitchell, Richards and their companies on matters relating to City of Atlanta contracting, even though she was a high-level city employee at the time. Bickers also allegedly provided Mitchell and Richards with sensitive contracting information during the critical time when they were bidding on city contracts. Between 2010 and 2013, Mitchellâs and Richardâs companies received multi-million dollar contracts with the city for snow removal, sidewalk repair and maintenance, and bridge reconstruction.

In effort to conceal her relationship with Mitchell and Richards, Bickers allegedly filed numerous false City of Atlanta Financial Disclosure Forms. For example, in 2011, Bickers swore under penalty of perjury that she had no financial relationships with any outside businesses, even though Mitchellâs and Richardsâ companies paid her over $650,000 in that year. She used much of this money to purchase a $775,000 lakefront home in Jonesboro, Georgia, making a down payment of over a half million dollars. In that same year, Bickers also allegedly claimed on her taxes that she made only $57,896 as a city employee, resulting in a $3,924 tax refund from the IRS.

In 2013, Bickersâ financial ties to the Pirouette Companies came to light and Bickers resigned her position with the City of Atlanta. After her resignation, Bickers, Mitchell, and Richards allegedly continued the bribery scheme. For example, Bickers helped Mitchell secure a multi-million dollar contract for snow and debris removal work after a snowstorm locked down Atlanta in 2014. In turn, Mitchell paid Bickers and companies associated with her hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. Bickers spent the proceeds of the bribery at stores like Gucci and on expensive vacations, home renovations, four Yamaha WaveRunners, a sports utility vehicle and an ATV. Bickers is also charged with money laundering for purchasing an SUV and four WaveRunners with bribery proceeds from an account held by the Bickers Group, which was her political consulting company.

Ultimately, between 2010 and 2015, Mitchell and Richards allegedly paid Bickers and companies associated with her over $2 million in an attempt get City of Atlanta contracts through bribery. In this same period, the City of Atlanta paid Mitchellâs and Richardsâ businesses approximately $17 million for the government contracts they secured.

In September 2015, Mitchell began cooperating with FBIâs investigation into corruption at City Hall. On September 11, 2015 at approximately 5:30 a.m., Shandarrick Barnes threw a concrete block reading âER, keep your mouth shut!â through a plate glass window in Mitchellâs home. Bickers is alleged to have played a role in this attempt to obstruct the federal investigation. Barnes will be sentenced by District Court Judge Steven C. Jones on April 9, 2018.

Mitzi Bickers, 51, of Atlanta, Georgia, was arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Russell G. Vineyard. Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges. The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the governmentâs burden to prove the defendantâs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

This case is being investigated by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey W. Davis are prosecuting the case.

17,"The jailed promoter of crisis-hit mortgage lender DHFL, Kapil Wadhawan, has offered his personal and family properties, which he claims are worth Rs 43,000 crore, for repayment of outstanding loans of lenders to the company.

Wadhawan wrote to RBI-appointed administrator R Subramaniakumar on October 17 saying his offer would ensure maximum value for the assets that have been put on the block to repay loans.

Currently under judicial custody, Wadhawan has proposed to the transfer of the right, title and interest in various projects which form part of the real estate portfolio of his family to enable proper and complete resolution of DHFL and to maximise the value of the properties.

The valuation of these projects including Juhu Galli project and Irla project are about Rs 43,879 crore that to at a 15 per cent lesser market value, the letter dated October 17 said.

Wadhawan has mentioned that after the IL&FS crisis in September 2018, not only DHFL but all the NBFCs face major financial crisis and the company took various steps and repaid Rs 44,000 crore of liabilities by monetising DHFL's assets such Aadhaar housing finance Ltd, Avanse Financial, DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers and DHFL Pramerica Trustee Ltd.

On June 7, 2019, RBI issued a circular on Prudential Framework for resolution of stressed assets and the process of restructuring DHFL's debt and resolution of its financial stress began.

An Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) was executed on July 5, 2019 among the banks and some lenders. The exposure of the lenders who signed the ICA was Rs 39,000 crore.

Even today DHFL's collection has been between Rs 10,000-15,000 crore and are available to repay the lenders, Wadhawan said in the nine-page letter sent from Taloja jail on the outskirts of Mumbai, where he and brother Dheeraj are currently lodged.

Wadhawan, who is in judicial custody since April on various charges including violation of money laundering law, said, ""The erstwhile management of DHFL have made all the efforts to resolve the financial stress being faced by DHF. This letter is one more effort in continuation of our resolve.

Last week, Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises and two other entities placed bids for DHFL, the first financial services player undergoing insolvency process, according to sources.

The US-based Oaktree and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy submitted bids for DHFL on October 17, the last date to submit final bids, the sources said.

In November, the Reserve Bank referred DHFL, the third largest pure-play mortgage lender, to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings.

According to a filing last month, fraudulent transactions worth Rs 17,394 crore were reported at DHFL during 2006-07 to 2018-19, as per a report of transaction auditor Grant Thornton.

Fund diversion by the promoters of DHFL resulted in lenders classifying DHFL account as ""fraud"".

Another fraudulent transactions worth Rs 12,705.53 crore were reported by the forensic audit, followed by the third one earlier this month.

The third fraud worth Rs 2,150.84 crore, by way of undervaluing the company's insurance subsidiary, was detected by Grant Thornton.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The government on Wednesday designated six leaders of the violent street gang MS-13 as international criminals, stepping up a crackdown on the sprawling U.S. and Central American gang's finances.

The Treasury Department in October designated MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, as an international criminal organization. The Obama administration said that makes the gang subject to penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and gives the U.S. an opportunity to hinder MS-13's ability to funnel money to its leaders in El Salvador or launder criminal proceeds through otherwise legitimate businesses.

Adding the names of six of the gang's purported leaders allows the U.S. to target their bank accounts individually.

The men added to the transnational criminal organization designation are: Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon, 28; Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 37; Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa-Larios, 39; Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, 44; Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35; and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34.

All are from El Salvador. Turcios, Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios have been indicted in the United States on criminal charges. Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios are jailed in El Salvador and Turcios' whereabouts are unknown. Federal court records do not list attorneys of any of the three men.

Henriquez is believed to be the head of the gang's operations in El Salvador, despite being jailed in the Central American country.

The six men could not immediately be located by The Associated Press for comment.

Adam Szubin, who is the head of OFAC, said federal authorities are moving to freeze any assets the men may have in the United States, whether it be bank accounts or real property. While at least four of the six gang leaders are believed to be in prison in El Salvador, authorities believe they are still actively directing MS-13 operations and profiting from crimes including human and drug smuggling, racketeering, extortion and kidnapping.

Waldemar Rodriguez, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy assistant director for transnational crime and public safety, said financial penalties are part of a broader effort to halt the gang's activities in the U.S. Since 2006, about 4,200 MS-13 members have been arrested ""yet international criminal activities continue.""

""MS-13 is a rising public threat,"" Rodriguez said. ""We must take them on where ever they are.""

The gang was founded more than two decades ago by immigrants flee El Salvador's civil war. Taking lessons from the brutal conflict to the streets of Los Angeles, its founders built a reputation as one of the most ruthless and sophisticated street gangs, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jason Shatarsky.

MS-13 has a strong presence in Southern California, the District of Columbia and northern Virginia, all areas with substantial Salvadoran populations, and as many 10,000 members in 46 states. The gang is also allied with several of Mexico's warring drug cartels.

Shatarsky has said MS-13 members target residents and business owners for extortion, among other crimes. The gang is active throughout Central America and in parts of Mexico, too. Authorities in Europe have reported evidence of MS-13 expanding operations there.

Numerous killings in the U.S. have been attributed to the gang, including the 2003 slaying a pregnant Virginia teenager who had become an informant. Brenda Paz, 17, was stabbed to death and her body was left along the banks of the Shenandoah River.

Gang members have been linked to the 2007 execution style shooting deaths of three friends in a schoolyard in Newark, N.J. One victim was slashed with a machete before being shot. Six people have been charged in the case.",am
19,"CHICAGO (CBS) â Former Ald. Ed Vrdolyak asked to have his sentencing hearing postponed Thursday, after he fell and hurt himself and home.

Vrdolyakâs attorneys said he suffered a fall at his home on Monday and suffered head trauma that required hospital care. He was also set to go for an MRI on Wednesday, his attorneys said.

Vrdolyak is in a great deal of pain, and his primary care doctor is out of town until next week, his attorneys said. The doctor wants to see Vrdolyak and determine an appropriate treatment plan at that point, according to his attorneys.

Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Robert Dow to have Vrdolyakâs sentencing hearing moved from Oct. 2 to a yet-to-be-scheduled date in December so Vrdolyak can obtain the necessary medical treatment and also obtain medical records that he can present to the court.

Vrdolyak, 81, pleaded guilty in March to a tax charge tied to a tobacco settlement scheme. An indictment accused him of tax evasion tied to money he allegedly collected from a tobacco lawsuit settlement he never actually worked on.

He allegedly worked out a deal to collect up to $65 million in legal fees from the tobacco case, although the charges do not specify how much money he actually was paid or how much income tax he failed to pay.

According to the U.S. Attorney of the Northern District Of Illinois, Vrdolyak conceded that he helped another lawyer, co-defendant Daniel P. Soso, in evading income taxes from 1993 through 2004 and then again from 2008 through 2013. The money came from attorney fees received connected to a $9.2 billion settlement between the state and several tobacco companies in the 1990s.

He paid Soso between 2000 and 2005 around two million dollars, representing Sosoâs âagreed-upon share of the fees of the tobacco litigation.â

Vrdolyak pleaded not guilty in 2016 to an indictment accusing him of tax evasion charges. The federal charge alleged he obstructed an IRS investigation into the tobacco settlement by hiding payments with Sosoâs assistance.

Vrdolyak previously served a 10-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to mail fraud in a $1.5 million kickback scheme in 2008. He admitted to scheming with businessman and convicted scam artist Stuart Levine to split a payoff to arrange the sale of a Gold Coast building belonging to Smithfield Properties, eliminating other bidders.

The building had belonged to the former Chicago Medical School.

In the 2008 case, Vrdolyak was initially sentenced to probation by U.S. District Judge Milton I. Shadur. But in 2009, Vrdolyak was resentenced to 10 months in prison by Judge Matthew Kennelly after prosecutors appealed the original sentence and an appeals panel agreed.

The former alderman of the Southeast Sideâs 10th Ward earned the nickname âFast Eddieâ for his reputation for working backroom political deals while steering clear of criminal charges during his four terms as alderman from 1971 to 1986.

Vrdolyak also served the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, and he led the bloc of 29 aldermen who battled the late Mayor Harold Washington during the âCouncil Warsâ era, from 1983 to 1986. The âVrdolyak 29â blocked the mayorâs appointments and voted down his legislative initiatives, while voting themselves control of every committee on the City Council â though they were too few in number to override Mayor Washingtonâs veto.

Vrdolyak ran unsuccessfully against Mayor Washington in 1987 on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket. He then switched to the Republican Party and ran unsuccessfully for Cook County Circuit Court Clerk in 1988.

In 1989, Vrdolyak ran for mayor as a Republican in a special election following Mayor Washingtonâs death. He was trounced in that race by Democrat Richard M. Daley and went back to practicing law afterward.

Vrdolyak also hosted a talk radio show in the 1990s, and was also a key adviser to former Cicero Town President Betty Loren-Maltese, who was convicted in a scheme to loot the western suburbâs treasury.",am
20,"We are almost certainly going to have an inquiry into the 1993 dealings of Brian Mulroney and Karlheinz Schreiber. The inquiry has a narrow focus and will not deal with other possible corrupt practices by our former prime minister.

Since the inquiry will cover the Schreiber $300,000, the Ethics committee should focus on other matters, such as:

- The huge amounts of cash given to the Mulroneys during his years as PM: how much he got, how much they spent, where it came from, whether the Mulroneys paid tax on it.

- The money Frank Moores said he was collecting to give Mulroney after he was prime minister. How much was this? Was there a quid pro quo?

- Airbus. Where did the $20 million earmarked for Canadian schmiergelder go?

Due to the diligence of investigative journalists Stevie Cameron and Harvey Cashore, we know that Airbus, Thyssen and Messerschmitt Bolkow-Blohm earmarked tens of millions to influence the Canadian government during the Mulroney years. We need to start connecting some dots. We know Frank Moores lobbied for Airbus to help them get Air Canada to buy planes; we know Brian Mulroney appointed Frank Moores to the board of Air Canada just before the Airbus vote, but Moores was forced to resign because of a public scandal; we know Mulroney made other dubious appointments to the Air Canada board; we know that on February 4, 1986, Schreiber and Giorgio Pelossi opened two Swiss bank accounts, one each for Moores and Mulroney. All this has been in the public domain for years. We need to get testimony on these issues under oath and then we need someone to decide what it all adds up to.

- The 1983 Tory leadership covention where Schreiber chartered planes and bribed delegates to vote for Mulroney, apparently bankrolled by far-right Austrians and arms dealers: how many delegates were given free flights or bribed; who exactly was behind this and why; who besides Frank Moores was in on it; what did Mulroney know.

- Whether Mulroney should return the $2.1 million defamation suit settlement, given that he appears to have lied under oath during the proceedings. (David Johnston left this issue out of his recommendations for the inquiry.)

The Ethics committee should from now on put every witness under oath. They should consider granting immunity to witnesses, if that is possible.

In addition to the Ethics committee hearings and the inquiry, I urge investigative journalists and/or the RCMP to look into the wider issue of who else got bribes and who else paid bribes.

Schreiber has said that the ministries of transport and defence are where most of the graft is collected: those two ministries have the big-money contracts that can net the minister and other decision-makers the big kickbacks. During the Mulroney years, did the ministers of transport or defence have any extra spending money? Each big contract should be investigated. It seems pretty clear that the Mulroney government was into extraremuneratory deals, and it's very likely that the shennanigans went on with other nogoodnicks besides Karlheinz Schreiber.

21,"The National Police said on Friday they would not arrest two Indonesian nationals who were recently added to the list of global terrorists by the US government for their links to what it considered Indonesian-based terrorist organizations.
National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie said that the police would not take any action unless Washington filed a formal request through the National Central Bureau (NCB)-Interpol Indonesia. 'ÂÂAs far as I know,
we haven'ÂÂt heard any official information about that from the US government. I don'ÂÂt know if the National Police Chief has heard any of it,'ÂÂ he said.
On Wednesday, the US Treasury Department issued a press release stating that it had included two Indonesians, Afif Abdul Majid and Said Ahmad Sungkar, on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list for their alleged involvement in providing financial support for Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) and Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT), labeled by the US government as terrorist groups.
NCB-Interpol said that they had not received any special notice about the matter from the Interpol system, through which the member countries could share any urgent information about international crimes.
The US Treasury Department has said that JI and JAT still posed threats because the two groups, which were established and inspired by firebrand cleric Abu Bakar Ba'ÂÂasyir, had links to the international terrorist organization al-Qaeda.
'ÂÂThe threats posed by terrorist groups such as JI and JAT remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,'ÂÂ US Treasury'ÂÂs Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a statement.
Afif, who lives in Pacitan, East Java, allegedly provided funding to a terrorist camp and oversaw its recruitment process. As a member of JAT'ÂÂs consultative council (majelis syuro), he allegedly urged JAT fighters to take violent action against the National Police, according to the US treasury'ÂÂs statement. The US authorities said Afif donated US$2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp in early 2010.
Afif said that he was not concerned about the US move to designate him a terrorist. 'ÂÂI am just a preacher, it is impossible for me to have any assets in the US,'ÂÂ he said, adding that he preached from mosque to mosque and there had never been any problems with his activities.
Meanwhile, Said, who lives in Pekalongan, Central Java, is being accused of providing financial, material or technological support to both JI and JAT. The department has also found that he had recently conducted fund raising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.
Said did not understand the accusation leveled against him by the US government, saying 'ÂÂI have not even dreamed of being a JI or JAT member,'ÂÂ as quoted by tempo.co.id.
Said admitted, however, that he had a close relation with JAT founder Ba'ÂÂasyir, whom he regarded as his teacher. 'ÂÂHe was my teacher and we often preached together before he was taken to prison,'ÂÂ he added.
Disgraced cleric Ba'ÂÂasyir was sentenced to 15 years'ÂÂ imprisonment after being proven to have planned and raised up to Rp 1.39 billion ($125,358) for a terrorist training camp in Aceh.
In February last year, the US Treasury Department included another three JAT members in its terrorist list. They were JAT spokesman Son Hadi bin Muhadjir and two JAT members Mochammad Achwan and Abdul Rosyid Ridho.
Son Hadi accused the US government of slander, saying that its counterterrorism operation was just a disguise to take Indonesia'ÂÂs natural resources and wealth.
Insp. Gen. Arif Darmawan of the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) said that his agency would not directly help the US government should they ask them to arrest the two suspects or designees.
'ÂÂWe haven'ÂÂt received any information. In addition, we will not do whatever they want. We will verify the accuracy of the information. They also need to coordinate with the Foreign Ministry and the police before making any request,'ÂÂ he said.
The Indonesian authorities have detained more than 800 suspected terrorists and accomplices since the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 200 people, including foreigners.",am

Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were indicted on fraud and money laundering charges Tuesday in the multimillion-dollar college admissions cheating scam that has ensnared dozens of wealthy parents trying to get their kids into the nation's most prestigious colleges.

The ""Fuller House"" star and her husband, along with 14 other parents, were charged in Boston in a ""second superseding indictment with conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering,"" the Department of Justice said in a statement to Fox News.

Loughlin and Giannulli were charged last month with conspiracy to commit mail fraud. The new indictment adds a money laundering charge for all 16 defendants.

FELICITY HUFFMAN TO PLEAD GUILTY IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: 'I AM ASHAMED OF THE PAIN I HAVE CAUSED'

Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as crew team recruits, even though neither of them played the sport.

A rep for Loughlin did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. She and her husband appeared in a Boston federal court briefly last week and were not asked to enter a plea. The couple has not publicly commented on the allegations.

More than four dozen people have been charged in the nationwide scam, which is alleged to have placed students in top-tier schools like Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, the University of Southern California, UCLA and the University of Texas. A federal investigation into the matter â dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" â has been ongoing for more than a year.

The move comes a day after fellow actress Felicity Huffman, 12 other parents and a coach agreed to plead guilty â signaling an escalation in the case against the parents who are continuing to fight the allegations against them.

On Monday, the ""Desperate Housewives"" actress announced her decision to plead guilty, explaining that she accepts ""full responsibility"" for her actions.

""I am pleading guilty to the charge brought against me by the United States Attorney's Office,"" the ""Desperate Housewives"" alum said in a statement obtained by Fox News.

""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" Huffman continued. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.

""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty,"" she concluded.

Prosecutors say they will seek a prison sentence that's on the low end of between four and 10 months for Huffman.",am

24,"A group of fraudsters from the East of England who conned more than 50 people out of millions of pounds were today (26 April 2019) sentenced to a combined total of 21 years in prison at Southwark Crown Court.

The group ran a âboiler roomâ scam from 2014 to 2016, convincing elderly and vulnerable people to invest in fake companies. Some people were scammed more than once and one 83-year-old lost over Â£1m.

After a number of concerned victims contacted police, an investigation was launched by the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU). Forensic Analytics provided expert witness testimony on behalf of the prosecution.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk was jailed for six years and Muhammad Tanveer, 30, from Romford, received a seven year sentence. Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington and Ryan Weston from Wisbech, were jailed for four years and three years respectively. Accomplices Lucy Richardson, 25, Mandy Cross, 59, from Oprington, Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay and Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk all received suspended sentences.

A âboiler roomâ fraud sees criminals cold calling or emailing their victims pretending to be from an established and legitimate company to persuade them to invest in worthless or non-existent stocks, often using high pressure sales tactics.

Detective Chief Inspector Liz Fernandes, who led the investigation, said:âThese ruthless criminals conned many innocent people out of money they had worked hard for throughout their careers, tricking them into investing into non-existent companies and stocks. The sentences handed out today can never make up for the traumatic impact this has had on the lives of the victims, but we hope that it has brought them some closure. This was an incredibly lengthy and complex investigation and our officers have worked tirelessly in bringing these offenders to justice and ensuring they will remain behind bars for a considerable amount of time.â",am
25,"CHICAGO (CBS) â Knowing he would soon be sentenced for a brazen $23 million scam involving scores of phony pieces of sports memorabilia, an Arkansas con man looked at his oldest son in court and said, âI screwed it up.â

Pausing and tapping his fingers on a table, John Rogers explained that he cut a deal with the feds that led him to wear a wire against dangerous people â even killers â because he hoped it would help him get out of prison in time for the high school juniorâs last year of college.

Then the feds caught him selling fake merchandise all over again this fall, putting an end to any such hope. U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin called the move âmonumentally stupidâ on Wednesday, moments before he hammered Rogers with a 12-year sentence for a fraud of âbreathtakingâ proportions.

He did so after Rogers also admitted, âI didnât think of my son when I was doing these things.â

When the hearing ended, Rogers gave a thumbs-up to the boy, who quickly left the courtroom where he had earlier called his father his âhero.â

First charged in September 2016 for a scheme to use a fake Billy Sims Heisman Trophy as collateral for a $100,000 loan, prosecutors say Rogers was more recently involved in a ânew waveâ of fraud that involved a phony Super Bowl I game ball and even âa fake Mickey Mantle silverware set.â

Rogers, 44, wound up in federal jail here after a hearing on the matter last month.

Rogers said he set out to create âfantasy itemsâ â replicas â that would never fool the public. But he said he fell back into his old ways. He and his attorney, J. Blake Hendrix, also said Rogers has long battled a drug addiction. Rogers tested positive for cocaine in October, according to Hendrix, and Rogers said he brought cocaine along when he traveled to Chicago for last monthâs hearing.

âI know my words are shallow and may not be believed,â Rogers said.

Rogers pleaded guilty to wire fraud last March. He made the fake Sims Heisman using an honorary Heisman given to announcer Al Helfer in 1960. He swapped out the trophyâs nameplate but ignored a dent on the left side of its base, as well as scratches and other marks. He also failed to replace a missing screw.

The feds say Rogers had at least 26 victims, stealing $23 million that he must now pay back in restitution. He said more fake merchandise remains on the market.

Rogersâ case followed a yearslong FBI investigation into sports memorabilia auction houses such as Mastro Auctions in the western suburbs. Rogers secretly recorded Doug Allen, the former president of Mastro Auctions, who was sentenced to 57 months in prison last year. Hendrix also said Rogers wore a wire on other âvery bad people.â

Meanwhile, Rogers said he realized he had put himself in a position where he could no longer be a proper father to his children.

But Durkin told Rogers, âI canât care more about your children than you did.â",am
26,"A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent known for his lavish lifestyle wasÂ arrestedÂ Friday on charges of conspiring to launder money for the same ColombianÂ drug cartelÂ he was supposed to be investigating.

Authorities arrestedÂ Jose IrizarryÂ and his wife at their home near San Juan,Â Puerto Rico. Federal prosecutors say in a 19-count indictment that the 49-year-old used ""his positionÂ and his special access to informationâ to launder millions in drug profits.
They both posted $10,000 bail and were released.
âItâs a black eye for the DEA to have one of its own engaged in such a high level of corruption,"" said Mike Vigil, the DEA's former chief of international operations. ""He jeopardized investigations. He jeopardized other agents and he jeopardized informants.""
IrizarryÂ had been a model agent after joining the DEA in Miami in 2009. He was entrusted with an undercover money-laundering operation using front companies, shell bank accounts and couriers. Irizarry resigned in January 2018 after being reassigned to Washington when his boss in Colombia became suspicious.
ï¿¼
Previous reports by The Associated Press detailedÂ his alleged wrongdoing last year.
âHis fingerprints are all over dozens of arrests and indictments,â said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami. âIt could have a ripple effect and cause courts to re-examine any case he was involved in.â
Authorities said Irizarry filed false reports and misled superiors while directing the DEA to wire funds intended for undercover operations to accounts in Spain and other countries. The accounts were either controlled by him or connected to his wife and co-conspirators, prosecutors said.

The money funded a lavish lifestyle that included the purchase of a $30,000 Tiffany diamond ring, a BMW, three Land Rovers and a $767,000 home in Cartagena, as well as homes in south Florida and Puerto Rico, where the couple has been living.
A red Lamborghini with the same vehicle ID named in the indictment belongs to Jenny Ambuila, who was arrested last year in Colombia along with her father, Omar Ambuila, a customs agent in the port of Buenaventura, a major transit point for cocaine and contraband goods used to conceal the proceeds of narcotics sales. Before her arrest, Ambuila shared photos and videos of herself on Facebook posing next to the red sports car, which is valued at more than $300,000.
ï¿¼
One of two unnamed co-conspirators in the indictment is Diego Martin, a relative of Irizarry's wife, The AP reported. Martin is considered one of the top money-laundering suspects in Colombia over the past decade, according to U.S. and Colombian officials.
He was arrested in 1993 for allegedly hiding money for the Cali cartel in home appliances bound for Colombia. He was never charged and eluded prosecution ever since by leveraging relationships built over decades as an informant to multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies, the officials said.
The indictment comes a week after another DEA agent was sentenced to four years in prison for smuggling drugs from Puerto Rico to New York.

27,"Investors defrauded by Reed Slatkin hope to recover funds from Scientology groups
Los Angeles Times, Mar. 26, 2003
http://www.latimes.com/
By E. Scott Reckard, Times Staff Writer

Investors defrauded of $255 million by EarthLink Inc. co-founder Reed Slatkin are hoping to recover funds from the Church of Scientology International and six affiliated organizations that allegedly wound up with tens of millions of dollars from the investment scam, their attorneys said Tuesday.

The investors won an initial battle when a bankruptcy judge in Santa Barbara recently refused to block subpoenas ordering the Scientology groups to hand over records of money transferred to them by certain Slatkin investors who came out ahead financially. The subpoenas also seek records of communications the groups had about Slatkin, a longtime but now excommunicated Scientologist who was known for his celebrity clientele.

Investors burned by Slatkinâs schemes have sued individuals who profited, including supermodel Cheryl Tiegs and actor Peter Coyote. But the subpoenas mark the first legal targeting of church entities. No suits have been filed against the church or the affiliates. Attorneys expect months of legal wrangling before the subpoenas might yield anything.

Lawyers for the church groups, who sought to block the subpoenas, won a partial victory from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robin Riblet, who is overseeing Slatkinâs bankruptcy. The judge ruled Friday that they can participate in the subpoena process. That will allow the groups to mount further legal challenges and to have access to any documents that are made public.

Church of Scientology attorneys will confer with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee on the material that should be released through the subpoenas, âand to the extent the subpoenas seek to violate religious protections of communications between the church and its members, we will object,â said Joseph Eisenberg, a lawyer for the church.

One of the claims made to try to block the subpoenas was that details of money transfers are protected by âclergy-communicant privilegesâ â the status accorded to the confessing of sins to a priest. But attorneys for the trustee and the committee of unsecured creditors questioned in court documents âhow a simple monetary transfer, where no communication was involved, would violate any clergy-communicant privileges.â

In pleading guilty to fraud last year, Slatkin described his investment empire as a scam from its start in 1986. Lawyers for the trustee and the creditors contend that proves the âprofitsâ he distributed were ill-gotten, whether the investors knew it or not, and must be returned.

Legally, there is no protection for third parties such as the Church of Scientology if it can be shown that they received supposed profits from Slatkin, said Alexander Pilmer, an attorney for the trustee and creditors. He added that thereâs a potential for significant recoveries from the organizations.

âWe believe that Scientology entities received tens of millions of dollars from Slatkin or from Slatkinâs Ponzi scheme,â Pilmer said.

In a report to the Bankruptcy Court, trustee R. Todd Neilson calculated that investors poured $593 million into Slatkinâs investment pools. Neilson wants to recover as much as possible of the $195 million that investors received as purported profits.

Slatkin pleaded guilty nearly a year ago to fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges carrying a potential sentence of up to 15 years. The co-founder of the Internet service provider EarthLink is in federal custody, trying to win a lesser sentence by cooperating with prosecutors. Sentencing is set for June 9.

Slatkinâs plea agreement allowed him to request a lighter sentence because of what the plea agreement called the âpsychological impact of his association with certain individuals and/or groups,â a reference to his membership in the Church of Scientology and long and close relationship with some prominent members.

Linda Simmons Hight, a spokeswoman for the church in Los Angeles, said Slatkin âused his position in the church to suck in Scientologists who were victimized along with other people.â

Pilmer said dozens of people who profited from Slatkinâs scheme have settled the claims. The latest settlement, approved Friday by Riblet, was with CNN legal commentator Greta Van Susteren and her husband, tobacco litigator John Coale. They agreed to pay about $700,000 â about 81 cents on the dollar for the profits Slatkin paid them.",am
28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduran politician Juan Antonio âTonyâ Hernandez was found guilty of U.S. drug trafficking charges on Friday after a two-week trial that featured dramatic accusations of corruption against his brother, the Central American nationâs president.

The verdict against Hernandez, 41, on all counts was handed up by a jury in federal court in Manhattan. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17 and faces up to life in prison.

âThey reached a verdict that was inconsistent with the truth,â one of Hernandezâs lawyers, Omar Malone, told journalists outside the courthouse. âWe plan to appeal on behalf of Mr. Hernandez.â

Members of Hernandezâs family who attended the trial were swarmed by protesters as they left the courthouse. Some protesters chanted âFuera JOH,â meaning âOut with JOH,â referring to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in 2018 and charged with drug trafficking and possessing illegal weapons. U.S. prosecutors accused him of helping smuggle almost 200,000 kilograms (220 tons) of cocaine into the United States while enjoying the protection of his brother. President Hernandez has repeatedly denied the allegation.

In a Twitter post, he said that he received news of the verdict with âgreat sadness.â The verdict was âbased on testimonies of confessed murderers,â referring to former drug traffickers who cooperated with U.S. authorities in the trial.

The two-week trial featured testimony from Honduran drug traffickers who are now in U.S. custody and cooperating with authorities, including, Amilcar Alexander Ardon, a former mayor, and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Hondurasâ Cachiros gang.

Some of the most explosive testimony was from Ardon, who told jurors that Tony Hernandez promised Mexican drug lord Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1 million donation to his brotherâs presidential campaign in 2013.

Rivera Maradiaga, who admitted to murdering 78 people, testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandezâs lawyers urged jurors not to trust the prosecutorsâ cooperating witnesses, describing them as career criminals willing to lie to get their prison sentences reduced.

The president, who began his second term in January 2018 amid allegations of electoral fraud, has not been charged with a crime. He has represented himself as tough on narcotics and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing 24 traffickers to the United States. He said traffickers were using his brotherâs trial to seek revenge.

29,"Who Is Ivan Boesky?

Ivan Boesky, a renowned American arbitrageur, came to epitomize the âgreed is goodâ mantra during the 1980s era of financial excess. A major player in the hostile takeover and junk bond craze, and financial superstar, he became an inspiration for Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stoneâs 1987 movie, ""Wall Street""âbefore going to prison for his role in a 1986 insider trading scandal.

Key Takeaways

Ivan Boesky is a former investment banker who was convicted of insider trading in 1986 and fined a record $100 million.
Boesky made his money in the 1980s through investing in the stocks of companies that were primed for takeover.
He embodied the 1980s junk bond boom, in which leveraged buyouts of companies were financed by junk debt, and a life of excess and greed were the norm.
As part of his conviction, he served over three years in jail and informed on a number of his former colleagues and associates.
His conviction and that of his colleagues led to the passage of the Insider Trading Act of 1988, which increased the fines for securities violations.

Understanding Ivan Boesky

Ivan Boesky, the son of a Detroit strip club owner, rose to power and fame as the worldâs leading takeover arbitrageur and made a fortune investing in stocks of companies that were takeover targets. A public figure and author of "" Merger Mania: Arbitrage, Wall Street's Best Kept Money-Making Secret,"" he was unapologetic about the pursuit of money. In 1986, in a graduation speech at the Berkeley School of Business, Boesky said; ""Greed is all right, by the way, greed is healthyâ¦You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself."" It was a line that would be immortalized by Gordon Gekko.

It was also a message that chimed with the neoliberal economic policies Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had embarked upon. Corporate takeovers and downsizing were just the tickets for restructuring ossifying and highly unionized old industries. Boesky was, for a time, feted by the financial media, and his gospel of greed was much in demand on the speaking circuit. However, the Boeskys were nouveau riche parvenus, known for their conspicuous consumption, but not necessarily their good taste.

In 1987, Boesky suffered a spectacular and abrupt fall from grace when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced he had been using confidential inside information on upcoming dealsâchanneled through one of his underlings, investment banker Denis Levineâand was charged with illegal stock manipulation. These takeover targets included Nabisco Brands Inc., General Foods Corp., and Union Carbide Corp.

Boesky Brings Down the Curtain on the 1980s Junk Bond Boom

It was the end of an era of roaring corporate takeover activity and leveraged buyouts funded by junk debt. If all the raiders and junk bond traders were engaged in illegal activity, who would buy all these companies at their inflated prices?

As part of a plea bargain dealâin which he received a prison sentence of over three years and a $100 million fineâBoesky ratted on his tipster friends, including junk bond king Michael Milken. Boeskyâs testimony would bring Milken and his junk bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert to justice. Drexel had fueled the leveraged buyout boom through junk bonds and was famous for its predators' ball, an investment gala for corporate raiders, and financiers.

Milken would pay over a billion dollars in fines and restitution and served two years in jail. The following year, Congress increased the penalties for securities violations when it passed the Insider Trading Act of 1988. Boesky never recovered his reputation and was permanently barred from working in the securities industry.",am
30,"A West Hollywood man accused of attempting to sell fraudulent paintings to a South Florida gallery was sentenced to five years in prison by a Miami federal court on Wednesday.

Philip Righter, 43, pleaded guilty to three felony chargesâwire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraudâin a case filed in Los Angeles. He admitted to selling works he falsely claimed were created by artists such as Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Kurt Schwitters and Roy Lichtenstein. According to a statement from the US Attorneyâs office, Righter also admitted to using the fake art as collateral for loans on which he later defaulted, and using âbogusâ pieces for fraudulent write-offs on his income tax returns.

In total, Righterâs scheme attempted to swindle buyers out of around $6m, and he caused losses of at least $758,265 known to date. Additionally, his fraudulent tax returns resulted in $100,000 of unpaid taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), according to a plea agreement in the case.

In addition to the five-year felony sentence, US District Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the Southern District of Florida also handed down another sentence of 60 months in federal prison in another case involving Righter filed by prosecutors in Miami. Righter pleaded guilty in that case in March and admitted trying to sell Haring and Basquiat forgeries to the owner of a Miami art gallery, which remains unnamed in the court documents. Both sentences will run concurrent to each other.

Righter ran a fraud scheme in California up until 2018, in which he attempted to sell counterfeit or fake art as genuine works by famous artists. To make the pieces appear authentic, he used custom-made embossing stamps that were similar to those used by the estates of Basquiat and Haring on provenance documents he created, according to court papers. He also created fake gallery labels falsely identifying works as having been purchased from the New York-based Annina Nosei Gallery, a real dealership known for selling works by Basquiat and other artists.

In a bid for leniency from the judge, Righterâs defense attorney suggested that there was nothing âespecially complexâ about his fraud scheme, as the US Attorney claimed. ""Mr Righter simply logged onto the Internet and purchased artwork from, among other sources, eBay,â the documents say. âAll that was required was a computer with an Internet connection and some knowledge of these well-known artistsâ styles, works, and biographies, as well how letters of authenticity and provenance documents look and function (which could also be achieved through a series of Internet searches). The Haring and Basquiat estate embossing seals, though designed by Mr Righter, were also simply ordered from a commercial rubber stamp company.""

Yet Righterâs schemes grew increasingly more complicated and malicious. At first, he sold the works under his own name, but when he was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Art Crime unit and the Los Angeles Police Department about a fake Haring work he tried to sell to the unnamed Miami gallery in 2016, he began using the names of other people and organisations, the court documents say.

Also, Righter received or tried to obtain numerous loans by using the fake art and provenance documents. For instance, in February 2016, he submitted an application to an online lender, identified as âP.G.â in the court documents, a made up provenance document identifying a work as Roy Lichtensteinâs Seductive Girl (Study), saying it had been purchased for $103,200, and another work he said was by Keith Haring, which turned out to be a fake. The lender agreed to provide a loan of $5,000 against the Haring. When Righter defaulted on the loan, the lender sold the work through Leslie Hindman Auctioneers for $50,000; the auction house lost $35,351 on the transaction when the fraud was later discovered. Similarly, in August of that same year, Righter obtained a $270,000 loan against the fake Lichtenstein from another lender identified as âE.C.â. Once again, Righter defaulted and the lender took the work to an unnamed auction house, which deemed it a fake.

The court documents also outline several attempts by Righter to sell fake works of art. In May 2017, under the names of a father and son duo, he offered a UK buyer two works purportedly by Basquiat totalling over $1m. The collector wired Righter a deposit of Â£120,000 ($151,484) before discovering the works were fakes.

And in August of the same year, once again using another personâs name, Righter listed a piece purported made by Basquiat in 1983 with the word âSamoââthe artistâs well known street tagâwritten on it with an art sale website identified as âA.Bâ, providing fake provenance documents he said were from Annina Nosei gallery. The website sold the piece for $50,000 to a buyer in Dubai. In 2018, after the piece was determined to be a fake, the website had to refund the purchase price to the buyer and lost the $37,970 that they had already sent to Righter for the sale (minus the siteâs commission) for a total loss of around $88,000. Righter also sold another purported Basquiat to an Arizona buyer through the website for $90,000, whom the website also had to refund.

In 2018, under yet another personâs name, Righter attempted to sell two more purported Basquiat works to a gallery identified in the court papers as âS.W. Galleryâ, which offered him $990,000 for both. The gallery discovered that the works were fraudulent before the sale went through, after contacting Annina Nosei directly to verify the certificates of authenticity.

Righter also admitted to the court that he knowingly and willfully included a false W2 and documentation of a donation of fake art to a charity on his 2015 federal income tax return, which resulted in him receiving a refund of $54,858. Righter then signed and filed a false 2015 amended tax return, in which he claimed a loss of $2,575,000 related to art he said had been stolen. In truth, the art was fake and had no value. This fraudulently amended tax return resulted in carryback refunds for 2012, 2013 and 2014 totalling $52,485, according to court documents.

In the Florida lawsuit, Righter offered to sell the fraudulent Basquiat and Haring works to a South Florida gallery, auction houses and others under another name. When the gallery owner showed interest, Righter (who was still in Los Angeles) shipped a number of the forgeries to a warehouse in South Florida. Righterâs price for the forgeries was $1,056,000 and he directed the gallery owner to wire the money to his own bank account. He pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. The works in both cases have been seized by the FBI.",am

		Tech mogul Robert Brockman has been charged in a $2 billion tax evasion case, the biggest in US history, the Justice Department said Thursday.
		Brockman hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
		He was charged after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said.
		Brockman faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.

Houston technology executive Robert Brockman has been charged in the biggest-ever tax evasion case against a US citizen, after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said on Thursday.
Brockman, the 79-year-old chief executive of Ohio-based Reynolds and Reynolds Co, hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, using a web of off-shore companies in Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
Reynolds and Reynolds provides software used by auto dealerships to help manage their business.
The indictment alleges Brockman appointed nominees to manage the off-shore entities for him as a means of hiding his involvement, saying he even went so far as to establish a proprietary encrypted email system and use code words such as ""Permit,"" ""Red fish,"" and ""Snapper"" to communicate.
At a press conference in San Francisco, US Attorney David Anderson said Brockman was also charged in a securities fraud scheme, after he bought and sold debt securities in his own company, ""breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt.""
The debt was purchased thanks to inside informationÂ BrockmanÂ possessed, Anderson added.
He faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and numerous other counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.
""Mr.Â BrockmanÂ has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,""Â Brockman's attorney Kathryn Keneally said in an emailed statement.
A spokesman for Smith, who founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Anderson said Smith, who helped secure the charges againstÂ BrockmanÂ and famously announced at last year's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the tax evasion scheme.
BrockmanÂ and Smith have a business relationship dating back to the late 1990s, according to documents filed in connection with Smith's non-prosecution agreement.
Brockman, who is referred to as ""Individual A,"" became an investor in Smith's private equity fund in 2000, first with a $300 million commitment, and later increasing it to $1 billion.
As part of his non-prosecution agreement, Smith admitted to using a nominee trustee and corporate manager to hide his control in four off-shore companies. Some of his untaxed income was used to buy a vacation home in Sonoma, California, and ski properties in the Alps, and to fund charitable causes, Anderson said.
He will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, and will abandon a $182 protective refund claim and pay interest as part of the deal.
""Although Smith willfully and knowingly violated the law, Smith has accepted responsibility and agreed to provide complete and truthful cooperation,"" Anderson said.
Smith founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners and he is listed by Forbes as being the nation's wealthiest Black investor.",am
32,"Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf issued a video statement on Sunday saying officials had told him to quit as head of mobile operator Syriatel, in the latest twist in a tussle over assets and taxes that has uncovered a rift at the heart of the ruling elite.

Makhlouf, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad, said he would resist the pressure and refuse to step down as chairman â even though he said the officials had threatened to revoke the firmâs licence and seize its assets if he did not comply.

There was no immediate comment from the authorities.

Makhlouf, once widely considered part of the presidentâs inner circle and the countryâs leading businessman whom the U.S. Treasury said was the front man for Assadâs family wealth, has a business empire that ranges from telecoms and real estate to construction and oil trading.

He played a big role in financing Assadâs war effort, Western officials have said, and is under U.S. and EU sanctions.

But the video message â the third he has issued on the dispute in less than a month â underlined divisions that Syria experts say could mark the first major rift within the minority Alawite sect that has ruled the country since Assadâs uncle Rifaat tried to depose Assadâs father, the late president Hafez, in 1984.

He accused security forces earlier this month of arresting his employees in an âinhumane wayâ in an unprecedented attack from within the authoritarian system by one of the countryâs most influential figures.

In the statement issued on Facebook, Makhlouf said officials, who he did not name, had told him: âIf you donât comply â¦ the licence will be revokedâ.

âThey said you have until Sunday to either comply or the company will be taken and its assets seized,â Makhlouf said, adding they were threatening board members with arrests. It was not immediately clear when the video was recorded and which Sunday he was referring to.

He said there would be a âcatastrophicâ blow to the economy if Syriatel, a major source of revenue for the state, collapsed.

The Syrian pound fell to a record low of 1,750 to the dollar on Sunday with fears the rift would further damage an economy already hit by tougher U.S. sanctions and reeling from the damaging impact of the financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, which choked a main source of dollars into the country.

In Sundayâs message, Makhlouf who rose to prominence in the decade before the conflict in 2011, attacked war profiteers whom he said had moved in during the war. Senior businessmen say their growing role sanctioned by top officials has weakened Makhloufâs once dominant position.

âThose who had been before the war are concerned about the country and sacrificed with everything they have,â Makhlouf said.

The billionaire has been under U.S. sanctions since 2008 for what Washington calls public corruption and it has since toughened measures against top businessmen who are close to him.

The European Union has also slapped sanctions on Makhlouf since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, accusing him of bankrolling Assad.",am
33,"WASHINGTONâJoseph Hirko, former co-chief executive officer of Enron Broadband Services (EBS), Enronâs failed telecommunications business, was sentenced today to 16 months in prison, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.

In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Court Judge Vanessa Gilmore ordered Hirko, 53, of Portland, Ore., to forfeit approximately $7 million in restitution to victims through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. Hirko pleaded guilty on Oct. 14, 2008, in U.S. District Court in Houston to one count of wire fraud charged in a superseding indictment.

In July 2005, Hirko and four other EBS executives were tried on various charges of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, insider trading and money laundering relating to their employment at Enron. The trial resulted in a mistrial, and Hirko was subsequently charged in a superseding indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud and insider trading. According to the superseding indictment and the plea agreement, Hirko participated in Enronâs annual analyst conference in Houston at which Enron introduced EBS as one of its âcoreâ units. Enron also announced the development of a broadband operating system or âBOS.â According to the plea agreement, the BOS was purported to be an âintelligentâ operating system and was described as, among other things, a standard protocol for accessing real-time bandwidth.

As alleged in the superseding indictment, Enron issued a press release on May 15, 2000, announcing the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications. According to Hirkoâs guilty plea, the Warpspeed release falsely represented the status of the BOS and implied that it was already embedded and functioning as a part of Enronâs network. Specifically, the Warpspeed release stated that the BOS âallows application developers to dynamically provision bandwidth on demand for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content.â According to the plea agreement, Hirko reviewed and approved this language even though the Warpspeed release contained material inaccurate representations regarding the BOSâs status. In doing so, Hirko admitted that he acted with reckless indifference to the true facts, including: that the BOS was under development throughout his employment at Enron; that it was never embedded on Enronâs network; and that it could not dynamically provide bandwidth on demand or provide for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content. According to the plea agreement, Hirkoâs approval of the Warpspeed release, as well as other press releases, assisted in maintaining Enronâs overall stock price, thereby improperly maintaining the value of Hirkoâs holdings of Enron stock.

This case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Jack B. Patrick, Senior Trial Attorney Jonathan E. Lopez and Trial Attorney Liam B. Brennan of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section.

Charges against the EBS employees were initially brought in March 2003 by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors and agents formed to investigate matters related to the collapse of Enron. All remaining Enron Task Force cases are now being handled by the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, with the investigatory assistance of the FBI.",am
34,"Securities and Exchange Commission v. Brett Kennedy, et al. (No. 17-cv-01344) (W.D. Wash., filed Sept. 7, 2017)

Former Amazon Employee and College Friend Charged with Insider Trading

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a former Amazon financial analyst who allegedly leaked confidential information to his former fraternity brother in advance of a company earnings announcement so they could turn an illegal profit. The college friend and his trading partner also are charged in the SEC's complaint.

The SEC alleges that Brett Kennedy accessed nonpublic 2015 first quarter earnings information without authorization while working at Amazon and shared it with Maziar Rezakhani, who illegally traded on the financial results before their public release to make more than $116,000 in illicit profits. According to the SEC's complaint, Rezakhani paid Kennedy $10,000 in cash for the tip and also shared the trading profits with Sam Sadeghi, who was advising him on his brokerage account trades and joined Rezakhani at a meeting with Kennedy to discuss the nonpublic information. The SEC's complaint alleges that Rezakhani and Sadeghi aimed to establish a successful track record with the trading in Rezakhani's brokerage account and together open a hedge fund in New York that would accept investments from others.

According to the SEC's complaint, Rezakhani boasted on at least two trading-related internet communication platforms in the days leading up to Amazon's earnings announcement that he was predicting first quarter revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of -$0.12, writing that the ""numbers are so obvious"" that a ""5 year old can guess what they will do.""

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Western District of Washington, charges Kennedy, Rezakhani, and Sadeghi with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions along with the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties against Rezakhani and Sadeghi.

Sadeghi and Kennedy agreed to settlements that are subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Sadeghi agreed to pay disgorgement of $11,599.74 plus $1,035.39 in interest and an $11,599.74 penalty for a total of $24,214.87. Kennedy agreed to pay disgorgement of $10,000 plus interest of $875.36. Sadeghi and Kennedy both agreed to be enjoined from further securities law violations. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Kennedy.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Sallie Kim and supervised by Steven Buchholz of the San Francisco office. The litigation against Rezakhani will be led by Ms. Kim and Mr. Buchholz. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",am
35,"The leader of El Salvadorâs Texis Cartel, Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, alias âMedio Millonâ (Half a Million), allegedly silenced a witness who knew about his criminal history in the United States.

âMedio Millonâ is under investigation for the murder of a man who witnessed crimes committed in the United States. Cisneros turned to a leader of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha, imprisoned in Zacatecoluca, to kill a man who had knowledge of Cisnerosâ illicit businesses.

Cisneros called âEl Kabraâ in the Zacatecoluca maximum security prison in early 2010, to ask him to give him the green light to move against Santos Salvador Sanchez Regalado, who had been deported to the United States and who Medio Millon had met in Massachusetts when the two men both lived there in the early 2000s. Sanchez knew too much about Cisnerosâ affairs in El Salvador and in North America. Oscar Arturo Vasquez Alfaro, alias âel Kabraâ o âDragon el Fulton,â broker for the Mara Salvatrucha Programa Fulton in El Salvador, and associate of Medio Millon, was the man to help with the job.

El Kabra and his clique proved effective. On February 3, at just before four in the afternoon, Juan Jose Chavez, aged 54, identified the body of his son, Santos Salvador Chavez Regalado, aged 26, on the main street of the BarrancÃ³n neighborhood, in the Sunapa Canton, Nueva ConcepciÃ³n.

âThe body has various entry wounds made by firearms. At the crime scene there were 9 mm shells and blood splattersâ¦Neighbors reported hearing multiple gunshots at 10:30. The deceased was driving on a 1983 Yamaha motorbike, which was yellow with blue stripes and had plates M 52-140,â read the police report, which was added to the summary prepared by the National Civil Policeâs (PNC) investigatory body in August 2010, part of the prosecutorâs investigation.

That record also contained a revelation about Cisneros Rodriguezâs past, one that has a narrow relation to the US Treasury Departmentâs recent decision to include Cisneros on the list of six MS-13 members mentioned as âobjectivesâ for American law enforcement and prosecutors. A witness who spoke to the PNC in 2010 said that Medio Millon had joined a gang involved in drug trafficking in Massachusetts between the late 1990s and the end of 2000. The witness also said that Santos Chavezâs knowledge of this was one of the reasons that El Kabraâs men killed him.

âThe witness indicates that there was communication between the two subjects Oscar Vasquez Alfaro (âel Dragon de Fultonâ) and Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez (âMedio Millonâ) about the homicide. The victim knew about the drug trafficking and extortion operations run by âEl Dragon de Fultonâ for Programa Fulton, and about the drug sales and homicides committed by âMedio Millon.â The victim knew even more about âMedio Millonâsâ drug trafficking operations when the two knew each other in Massachusetts, given that at that time âMedio MillÃ³nâ belonged to a gang that operated in that US state,â read the police report.

US state and federal authorities, along with Massachusetts district court records, attest that Cisneros lived in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2009. Local police records indicate that he was in Nantucket, an island 48 kilometers outside the port of Boston, in 1998, 2006, and 2009, and judicial records indicate that he was involved in civil cases in 2001 and 2002.

Although Massachusetts criminal court records do not indicate that there are currently proceedings open against Cisneros, police in Washington confirmed that he was a person of interest over the last decade in Boston in relation to multiple drug trafficking investigations.

A unique case

The attorney generalâs office investigated Cisneros and 34 members of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha (FLS) for the murder of Chavez Regalado, as well as five other people who received orders from El Kabra from inside Zacatecoluca prison in 2010. That was the year that âMedio MillÃ³nâ managed to escape an operation mounted to execute the arrest warrant issued by a judge for those cases, thanks to a timely warning from a deputy police inspector, say souces in the PNC, the attorney generalâs office, and US law enforcement.

Police intelligence reports on these crimes say that the majority of the victims are âmembers of the same gang, killed for having broken the rules. An example of this is the âMagalyâ case, in which a gang member asked el Kabra to greenlight the murder of another âhomieâsâ girlfriend in retaliation for betraying him. Intergang rivalry is also a frequent cause of homicides.â Only the murder of Santos Chavez, the old acquaintance from Massachusetts, has a distinct motive, according to investigators: silencing a potential witness in cases related to the United States and drug trafficking.

The leader of the hitmen, a gang member named Pedro Quintanilla, alias âEl Serio,â took advantage of the situation to recover a personal debt, says the police report. After taking the first bullets, Santos Chavez fell flat on the dusty road, a few meters from his motorbike. The gunmen arrived to finish him off. âEl Serioâ went through the victimâs pockets and found $200, which he later used to pay back a small drug debt he owned.

Medio Millon, in addition to asking his associate Oscar Arturo, El Kabra o âDragon de Fultonâ to organized the hit, also provided the arms, as he usually did: two AK-47s and five 9 mm pistols from Honduras.

36,"A judge told the disgraced former MP that he had âthrown away his good name and characterâ with âblatant dishonestyâ and âliesâ.

Despite a high-flying job as a junior environment minister, the 58-year-old fraudulently claimed Â£800-a-month interest on mortgage payments on his constituency home in Lincolnshire.

MPs are allowed to claim interest on their mortgages, but the actual monthly interest Morley paid was only ever between Â£6 and Â£52.

He even carried on claiming the Â£800 after his mortgage was paid off.

In total he claimed Â£32,000 when, under parliamentary expenses rules, he was only entitled to Â£1,572.

At Londonâs Southwark Crown Court Mr Justice Saunders said: âI am satisfied from the nature of the mortgage transactions and the correspondence that the excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable, even in part, by oversight.

âThe continuation of the claim for Â£800 a month after the mortgage had been redeemed can properly be described as blatant dishonesty.â

He added: âThe results of this case are tragic for the defendant and his family. He has thrown away his good name and good character.â

Morley, a father of two who was elected MP for Scunthorpe in 1987 and stood down before last yearâs general election, admitted two counts of false accounting.

The admission made him the first minister and most high-profile politician to be caught in the scandal.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said under parliamentary expenses rules, Morley was entitled to claim mortgage interest on his second home in Winterton, Lincs.

But, in fact, the Liverpool-born MP âengaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses systemâ, submitting a total of 40 fraudulent claims.

Between May 2004 and February 2006, he submitted 19 claims worth Â£15,200, and between March 2006 and November 2007 he submitted 21 claims totalling Â£16,800.

After receiving a letter from the parliamentary fees office, Morley explained his behaviour as an âembarrassing and inadvertent oversightâ.

Jim Sturman QC, mitigating, said that Morley had paid back the full amount owed immediately.

He said: âThis is a tragic end to a lifetime of public service. He has done an enormous amount of good, often for no pay.

âHeâs made a grotesque error of judgment.â

Mr Justice Saunders said Morley avoided a longer jail sentence despite claiming more money than other MPs who had also been convicted over the expenses scandal because of the lack of sophistication of his fraud.

He said: âWhile this defendant is charged with obtaining more money than any other MP and over a long period, the degree of sophistication involved in carrying out the fraud was less than in some other cases.â

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayersâ Alliance, said: âMorleyâs jail sentence is justice for taxpayers whom he cheated and stole from.

âThe damage done by the MPsâ expenses scandal is still being repaired and it will take time to restore the publicâs trust in the system, but this is another step down that road.

âThis sentence sends a clear message that even a former minister is not above the law, and stealing from the taxpayers he was supposed to represent is a very serious crime.â

A Labour Party spokesman said: âElliot Morley had already been suspended from the Labour Party and following his custodial sentence, he has now been excluded.â",am
37,"What is one to make of the secret activities of the Habsburg Group?

In 2011, following Viktor Yanukovychâs election as Ukraineâs president, then U.S. political consultant Paul Manafort was hired to develop plans to promote the international political goals of the new leader in Kiev.

Yanukovych sought strong support from West European governments and from the U.S. Congress and the White House.

The plans and their funding were to be kept strictly secret. Over four years, at least $11 million was spent by Manafort. The money was distributed via a host of shell companies in a dozen jurisdictions to lobbyists that he recruited on both sides of the Atlantic â at least $2 million went to the Hapsburg Group.

Manafort explained to Yanukovych that this was a âA super VIP group of former heads of European governments and VIP officials.â

Gusenbauer, Prodi and Kwasniewski

Details of Manafortâs operations were disclosed last Friday in documents presented to the federal court in Washington, D.C. by the U.S. Justice Department on behalf of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Significantly, immediately prior to the court filing, on September 13, 2018, Manafort agreed to plead guilty to a obstruction of justice and a catch-all âconspiracy against the United States,â which include failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign government.

He has plenty of reasons to cooperate with the U.S. government now, given that just a few weeks ago Manafort was found guilty of charges that included bank fraud, $30 million of money laundering and $15 million of tax evasion.

The EUâs left supports Ukraineâs right wing?

The VIP team that Manafort created is referred to repeatedly in the court documents as the Habsburg Group, which is coordinated by former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. Leading members include former European Commission President and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, as well as former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski.

Politically, two facts are surprising: First, these politicians are all prominent left-of-center politicians. Second, they became highly active advocates of the right-wing Yanukovych regime.

Denials so far

According to U.S. media reports, they have either refused to comment on the allegations or denied suggestions that they secretly took cash to promote the interest of Ukraine.

The court papers noted, just as an example, that the team promoted the interest of the Ukraine government in meetings in the three months from November 2012 to February 2013 with, among others: European Parliament (EP) leader Martin Schultz, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, senior EU and IMF officials.

Plans were set for meetings with senior U.S. government officials, which other court documents show did take place later in 2013.

Manafortâs Connection

The former European political leaders who worked under the auspices of the Habsburg Group had multiple contacts with Paul Manafort. It is surprising that they apparently asked few questions about the ways in which they were being paid, through offshore shell companies, and why Manafort insisted that his name never be mentioned in any of their dealings on behalf of Ukraine.

Manafort will go to prison and he will pay a steep fine. In contrast, the European officials and former political leaders that he employed are unlikely to face investigations, let alone their days in court.

This is astonishing, especially considering that they may have violated laws, and/or acted in ways that are counter to the ethical standards of the governments or international institutions that at differing times they represented.

Conflicts of interest

For example, Aleksander Kwasniewski was allegedly receiving cash as a member of Habsburg Group at the same time as he co-led a European Parliament (EP) mission to Ukraine to monitor conditions there.

The then-EP President Martin Schultz declared at the time: âThe missionâs reputation of impartiality and independence is a great asset to both the EU and to Ukraine, and it is part of a process of increasing engagement, which has to continue.â

The Commission had positive things to say about Ukraine, which must have brought a wide smile to Manafortâs face.

Why not a European Parliament investigation?

So, will there be a serious European Parliament investigation now into what was so clearly a conflict of interest?

I doubt it. After all, over the last five years there appears to have been 24 cases of so-called ethics complaints involving EP members, but nobody has been sanctioned.

Many of the likely conflicts of interest of European politicians are not nearly as complex as the schemes that Manafort devised. Rather, they may well relate to outside commercial interests of elected parliamentarians.

The disclosure guidelines governing investments and outside business income of elected parliamentarians across most of Europe are overly general and rarely, if ever, effectively monitored.

In some parliaments in Europe, such as Germany and the UK, there are no serious requirements on members to disclose information about consulting work they may be doing on the side and who their clients might be.

European political ethics

The disclosures in the Manafort papers ought to set off some alarm bells in Europe. At a minimum, it should launch a serious conversation in European capitals and in the European parliament about conflicts of interest, about the ways they are prevented and about the enforcement of ethics regulations.

It would be worthwhile as well to review whether or not there should be regulations regarding the ways in which top politicians operate, and lobby, after they leave office.

At a time of growing populism, it does not sit well with the public at large that politicians often state they seek the publicâs trust, but are then prepared to abuse their power as they scheme to get rich.

Clearly, they should neither be able to operate with impunity, nor assured that their unethical actions will not be investigated, let alone prosecuted.

Manafort to tell all

Meanwhile, perhaps the Habsburg Group members will now have a few sleepless nights. The documents that have been filed in U.S. court are the start, not the end of public disclosures.

Paul Manafort is about to start talking to the U.S. Special Counsel in a desperate effort to earn some mercy as he currently faces at least 10 years in jail.

Manafort agreed as part of his plea deal to âcooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with the Government and other law enforcement authorities identified by the Government in any and all matters as to which the Government deems the cooperation relevant.â

To the undoubted horror of president Trump, Manafort will undoubtedly be asked by Robert Mueller to reveal everything he knows about possible deals and connections between the Trump election campaign, in which he served as chief manager for several months in 2016, and Russians.

He may also be asked to provide far more details about the law firms, banks, consultants, and former European politicians he paid over the years as he secretly and unlawfully lobbied for Ukraineâs Viktor Yanukovych.",am
38,"Who Is Michael Milken?

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute. Milken was an executive at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s and used high-yield junk bonds for corporate financing and mergers and acquisitions. Milken amassed an enormous personal fortune and was indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury and eventually spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud. While he is credited with founding the high-yield debt market, he was banned for life from the securities industry.

Key Takeaways

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute.
He joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969 and started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s.
Milken was indicted and spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud.
Milken was banned for life from the securities industry.

Understanding Michael Milken

Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. It was during his time with the firm that he started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s. These bonds provide much-needed capital for companies that don't necessarily have ready access to credit. During his time at the firm, he was able to raise a huge amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. This allowed him to eventually expand his high-yield bond department. At the height of his success, Milken earned between $200 million and $550 million a year.

On April 24, 1990, Milken plead guilty to five technical counts of violating securities laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, but was released after two years for good behavior. He was also fined $600 million. Since his release, Milken has been remaking his image and is attempting to secure a pardon for the charges he plead guilty to in 1990.

Following his release from prison, he worked as a strategic consultant. This was in violation of his probation, and he was subsequently fined $42 million for these actions. In 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since then, he has devoted much of his time and resources to the pursuit of a cure for the disease.

After being released from prison, Milken was fined for working as a consultantâa violation of his probation.

According to Forbes, Milken's net worth is estimated at $3.7 billion as of September 2019. He co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation as well as the Milken Institute, an economic think tank that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.

Special Considerations

Early in his career, Milken saw an opportunity to leverage junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. He saw a way for investors to see high returnsâon a risk-adjusted basisâby buying bonds that were issued by companies with low credit ratings compared with acquiring bonds from AAA-rated companies. At the time, the availability of such bonds was limited and Milken anticipated demand would quickly outpace supply for this investment opportunity. The firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham Lambert, launched an effort to underwrite more junk bonds by convincing such companies to issue them.

The companies in question may have been early-stage or otherwise not well-established. Their low credit rating may not necessarily have been a result of poor financial health, but rather from a lack of an extensive track record to base their credit ratings on. Such circumstances are typically seen with new and emerging industries. From the companiesâ perspective, issuing bonds was a way to potentially access more capital that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue. Milkenâs efforts at Drexel Burnham are credited with launching this market.

As the junk bond market grew, Milken sought to maintain a dominant position over this sector, and some of his efforts led to engaging in business activities that eventually led to his arrest and conviction for securities fraud.",am

40,"It took 21 years and $656m (Â£415m) of fees paid to two firms of lawyers and accountants but on Thursday the files were finally closed on the banking scandal that was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It ranged from arms trafficking to prostitution and ended with a $20bn collapse.

Liquidators and lawyers acting for creditors to BCCI held a final meeting with victims of Britain's biggest banking scandal. About 150 creditors sat in silence at Westminster's Central Hall as liquidators from Deloitte and lawyers from Hogan Lovells explained how the battle for recoveries had taken them around the world, to ""desert warehouses"" and remote locations where ""documents were rotting in damp, humid and rat-infested rooms"". On some occasions the inspection of papers was only permitted under armed guard.

Deloitte amassed a library of 95,000 box files containing about 100m chaotically ordered documents â material that spawned a welter of litigation around the world, including the unprecedented decision, eventually aborted, to sue the Bank of England, which was responsible for bank regulation at the time of the BCCI collapse, for misfeasance in public office.

The failure of BCCI also revealed a nest of corruption, money laundering and other secretive activities. Organisations such as the CIA, Manuel Noriega and mujahideen guerrillas were linked to BCCI.

A damning report was produced by Lord Bingham in Britain, while in the US Senator John Kerry's report to the foreign relations committee delivered his verdict: ""BCCI's criminality included fraud by BCCI and BCCI customers involving billions of dollars; money laundering in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas; BCCI's bribery of officials in most of those locations; support of terrorism, arms trafficking, and the sale of nuclear technologies; management of prostitution; the commission and facilitation of income tax evasion, smuggling, and illegal immigration; illicit purchases of banks and real estate; and a panoply of financial crimes limited only by the imagination of its officers and customers.""

A string of more than 60 prosecutions followed, including, in Britain, that of Abbas Gokal, a businessman with intimate ties to the bank, who received a record 14-year jail sentence.

BCCI, which at its peak had 417 offices in 73 countries, collapsed in July 1991 with liabilities estimated at close to $20bn. Adding to efforts by Deloitte and Hogan Lovells on behalf of English creditors, legal and liquidation costs for other divisions of BCCI took the total bill for lawyers and insolvency professionals to $1bn.

Angus Martin, one of three joint liquidators dealing with BCCI's UK estate, told the Central Hall meeting that the $369m bill from Deloitte represented value for money. He pointed to a recovery rate for creditors of 90p in the pound. ""I think it has been very successful. I don't think anybody in the early days thought we were going to get anywhere near that figure.""

After the meeting Martin accepted the recovery figure had been flattered greatly by the passage of time and that a pound in 1991 would have a value today of Â£1.76. ""Even that conservative calculation gives a figure of about 50%, which is still a good result is liquidations go."" An inflation-adjusted recovery rate is not given by Deloitte in the 78-page final report.

Many attending the meeting were elderly figures from an Asian background, reflecting the bank's deliberate decision in the 1980s to target British communities with links to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Almost two decades ago, many of them had been among the thousands who descended on the first creditors' meeting at Wembley Arena, a more angry affair.

At the 1994 meeting Keith Vaz MP, who had seen many Leicester East constituents caught up in the BCCI scandal, emerged as one of the loudest voices of scepticism at the huge sums of money being taken by Deloitte liquidators and their advisers. On Thursday Vaz was again in attendance. He said: ""This process has made millionaires of the liquidators. What we need is a proper inquiry into these liquidation fees. Why is this still important? It has lasted 21 years; Lehmans [the US investment bank which failed in 2008] is going to be even longer. Government seems to think it has no role in this. That's got to change.""

Martin said the liquidation process was helped by the collaborative approach to asset recoveries taken by Deloitte and counterparts responsible for liquidating BCCI operations overseas.That position is in marked contrast to the legal feuding which has characterised the early years of the Lehmans insolvency process, which in Europe is being carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers. While Lehman was not infected with widespread criminality in the same way as BCCI, some of its investment banking activities represent a much greater challenge in terms of their complexity.",am
41,"Perence Shiri born Bigboy Samson Chikerema on 11 January 1955 died on the 28th of July 2020

Shiri was a Zimbabwean air officer and government official who served as Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe from 1 December 2017 until his death in 2020.

He was the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe and member of the Joint Operations Command which exerts day-by-day control over Zimbabweâs government.

Perrance Shiri was a cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, he called himself âBlack Jesusâ because according to an anonymous claim on BBC Panorama documentary âThe Price of Silenceâ, he âcould determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or not.â

On 30 November 2017, Shiri was appointed Minister of Agriculture by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. On 18 December he was promoted from Air Marshall to Air Chief Marshall upon retirement.

Shiri was widely criticized by human-rights organizations for his part in masterminding Zimbabweâs Gukurahundi massacres. The killings, which took place between 1982 and 1985, left as many as 20,000 dead in the countryâs two Matabeleland provinces and the Midlands Province.

At the time, Shiri commanded the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, which is accused of mass executions and torture.

Shiri died on 28 July 2020. It is believed that the minister succumbed to COVID-19 and died after having being hospitalised two days earlier.

In 1992, Shiri was appointed as the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, taking over from Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai.

Shiri was in command of the Zimbabwean troops at the start of the Second Congo War. It was Shiri who decided that the Zimbabwean contingent would defend NâDjili and its airport. This was in order to maintain an air route for resupply and reinforcements if needed.

In the late-1990s and early-2000s, Shiri was reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans. In 2002, in response to the subsequent food shortage, Mugabe dispatched Shiri to South Africa to purchase maize. This undertaking was backed by a credit note for the equivalent of Â£17 million from the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi.

Shiri was ambushed on 13 December 2008, while driving to his farm. According to police, he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car. Thinking one of his tyres had burst he got out and was subsequently shot in the arm. It has been speculated that the assassination attempt may have been a response to Shiriâs attacks on illegal diamond miners in 2008 or because of his role in Matabeleland in the 1980s.

In October 2013, Shiriâs son, Titus Takudzwa Chikerema, died at the age of 21.",am
42,"Law enforcement agencies in Boston have charged a Ukrainian national with hacking, credit card trafficking and money laundering conspiracies in a $94 million case.

According to the US Attorneyâs Office in the District of Massachusetts, Vitalii Antonenko, 28, (and residing in New York), was indicted on one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorised access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorised access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

In March 2019, Antonenko was arrested and detained on money laundering charges at New Yorkâs John F. Kennedy International Airport after he arrived there from Ukraine carrying computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.

Last year, Antonenkoâs lawyers requested a psychiatric evaluation as they said he had difficulty communicating and suggested he is covertly working for the CIA. (Reminds me of the 2002 movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.)

In this latest development, heâs only been charged, but depending on the outcome Antonenko could face 20 years in jail and be fined up to $500,000 over the money laundering conspiracy.

As alleged in the indictment, Antonenko and (unnamed) co-conspirators scoured the internet for computer networks with security vulnerabilities that were likely to contain credit and debit card account numbers, expiration dates, and card verification values (payment card data) and other personally identifiable information (PII).

They used a hacking technique known as a âSQL injection attackâ to access those networks without authorisation, extracted payment card data and other PII, and transferred it for sale on online criminal marketplaces. Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership and control.

US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the US Secret Service Boston Field Office made the announcement. Assistant US Attorney Seth B. Kosto of Lellingâs Cybercrime Unit is prosecuting the case.

The US Attorneyâs Office reminds everyone the details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often get a bad rap. Why? Usually because of the criminal activities linked to it. There are too many stories to mention, but just this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement action in the US against a dastardly Dane for his $1.5 million foreign currency (forex) fraud scheme and registration violations.

Client funds were withdrawn from the US bank accounts by Casper Mikkelsen through his debit card, as well as transferred from the US bank accounts to an overseas bank, and from there to a Bitcoin address for Mikkelsenâs benefit. Mikkelsen then used the money to pay certain clients purported forex trading profits as is typical in a Ponzi scheme.",am
43,"NEW YORK (AP) â The former boss of Hondurasâ Los Cachiros cartel testified Friday that he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to the current and former presidents of Honduras in exchange for protection from extradition to the United States and other favors.

Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga said in a Manhattan court that he gave then-President Porfirio Lobo between $500,000 and $600,000 in 2009 and alleged that Lobo helped him launder the proceeds from drug trafficking.

Rivera Maradiaga also said he paid a $250,000 bribe to current President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez, without specifying the date. He said he bribed many Honduran politicians, including the current minister of security.

Lobo has denied wrongdoing, saying last week that he did not receive illicit money from anyone and calling accusations against him âfalsehoods from criminals who are trying to reduce their sentence in the USA.â

Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez, who is not charged, has similarly called allegations against him lies by âconfessed murderersâ who want lesser prison sentences and to get revenge against him for his extradition and anti-crime actions.

Rivera Maradiagaâs testimony came on the seventh day of the drug trafficking trial against Tony HernÃ¡ndez, HernÃ¡ndezâs brother.

The former trafficker, who acknowledged being responsible for 78 murders, later said on the witness stand that the leaders of another cartel, los Valle Valle, told him in 2014 that they planned to assassinate Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez because he stopped taking their calls after they helped finance his presidential campaign.

Rivera Maradiaga said he had no intention of going along with that plan.

âThe FBI revealed the magnitude of the plan by los Valle Valle cartel and its partners to assassinate me, because they knew that sooner or later we were going to capture them, extradite them and seize property obtained through blood,â President HernÃ¡ndez said Friday afternoon on Twitter. âOf that there is real proof; not like the accusations of the narco-assassins.â

Rivera Maradiagaâs testimony adds to a string of corruption and bribery accusations made at the trial.

He is considered one of the most prominent and violent drug traffickers in Hondurasâ recent history. He has said that from 2002 to 2013, he smuggled some 130 tons of cocaine to the United States.

In late 2013, he began collaborating with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The following year, he said, he met Tony HernÃ¡ndez at a Dennyâs restaurant in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, to discuss getting government money for a shell company that Rivera Maradiaga used to launder drug money. He filmed the encounter with a watch camera and gave it to the DEA, and it was shown in court Friday.

Defense lawyer Michael Tein questioned the witness about the millions he earned from smuggling drugs. Rivera Maradiaga said he made about $50 million and spent it on bribes, jewelry, property, contract killings and gifts to his girlfriends.",am
44,"Bruce Bagley knows a lot about money laundering. Too much, federal prosecutors say.

For decades, the University of Miami professor has been the go-to source for journalists looking to understand the shadowy worlds of drug trafficking, organized crime and government graft in Latin America and beyond. But in recent years, authorities say, he became intimately involved with the same corruption that he studied, helping to launder $3 million in dirty money from Venezuela while pocketing about $300,000.

âAbout the only lesson to be learned from Professor Bagley today is that involving oneself in public corruption, bribery, and embezzlement schemes is going to lead to an indictment,â William F. Sweeney Jr., the head of the FBIâs New York Field Office, said in a statement Monday.

The FBI on Monday arrested Bagley, who co-edited the 2015 book âDrug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today,â officials said. A statement from the University of Miami said that he had been placed on administrative leave âin light of this development.â

âIâm feeling just fine,â Bagley, 73, told CBS Miami on Monday. âNot guilty. Thatâs how Iâm feeling. Theyâve got it all wrong.â

Considered one of the foremost experts in his field, Bagley has served as a consultant to the FBI, State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal agencies, according to his official biography. He has repeatedly been invited to testify before Congress, served as an expert witness in high-profile trials and lent his expertise on topics including money laundering to the governments of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama and Mexico.

Erick Cruz, a Miami defense attorney who used Bagley as an expert witness in an October cocaine trafficking trial, told the Miami Herald that the professorâs arrest was âpretty shocking.â As an undergraduate at the University of Miami, he had taken Bagleyâs class, âDrug Trafficking in the Americas,â he told the paper.

âI remember him telling the class, âItâs not a how-to course, itâs a historical review,â â Cruz said.

As a professor of international relations, Bagley published dense academic articles with titles such as, âThe New Hundred Years War? US National Security and the War on Drugs in Latin America.â In one 2002 paper, he warned that Russian crime syndicates âhave been able to offer relatively low-risk money laundering services to a variety of South American drug traffickers, sometimes charging as much as 30 percent of the proceeds.â

He also frequently appeared in the media, popping up in a 1993 story in The Washington Post about cocaine trafficking in Panama as a âUniversity of Miami money laundering specialist.â Reporters from outlets including the New York Times and NPR routinely sought out his thoughts on topics such as the U.S. governmentâs attempts to fight drug trafficking overseas and the January protests targeting Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. As WLRN reporter Danny Rivero pointed out on Twitter, just hours before news broke of Bagleyâs arrest, he was quoted as an expert in a PolitiFact story on the value of the drugs being trafficked over the U.S. border.

In January, Bagley spoke to The Washington Post for a story about JoaquÃ­n âEl Chapoâ GuzmÃ¡n Loera, who at the time was on trial in Brooklyn.

âYou canât lop off its head,â Bagley said, referring to the Sinaloa cartel. âThe decentralization makes it hard to track down, capture and arrest all of the tentacles, and thereâs lots of money flowing through the organization.â

In recent years, prosecutors say, Bagley began using his expertise to funnel money âbelieved to be derived from graft and corruption in connection with public works projects in Venezuelaâ into the United States.

State records show that Bagley and his wife incorporated a business called Bagley Consultants Inc. in 2005. The company, referred to as âCompany-1â in the indictment, was barely active during its first decade of existence, and, in 2017, the Florida Department of State dissolved it for failing to file an annual report.

But before that happened, federal prosecutors say, Bagley opened a bank account in the companyâs name. Then, in November 2017, he began receiving monthly deposits of approximately $200,000 at a time. The money came from a bank account based in the United Arab Emirates, which purportedly belonged to a food company, and another located in Switzerland, which used the name of a wealth management firm based in the UAE.

In reality, authorities say, the money was coming from an unnamed Colombian individual and ârepresented the proceeds of foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people.â The professor allegedly admitted as much in conversation with another individual, known only as âIndividual-1,â who helped him to move the money around.

According to the indictment, Bagley and Individual-1 had a routine. They would go to Bagleyâs bank â located in Weston, Fla., the heart of South Floridaâs Venezuelan diaspora â and use a cashierâs check to transfer money to Individual-1â²s account. Roughly 90 percent of the ill-gotten cash went to Individual-1, and the remainder was wired to Bagleyâs personal account.

To hide the true source of the money, Bagley entered into âsham contractsâ with the Colombian national, prosecutors said in a Monday statement. Still, the bank shut down his business account around October 2018, citing âsuspicious activity.â According to the indictment, Bagleyâs response was to open another bank account so that he could continue receiving the cash transfers and taking his cut.

Court records donât specify what prompted investigators to take a closer look at Bagleyâs finances, but, in February, they launched a sting operation to see if he would accept a wire deposit of $224,000. The professor was allegedly informed that the money came from bribes and other corrupt dealings in Venezuela but helped move it anyway, keeping $44,000 for himself.

Although Bagley is based in Florida, the case is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York because the money passed through New York City before being deposited in his accounts. He has been charged with two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison on each charge if convicted.

âTodayâs charges of money laundering and conspiracy should serve as an object lesson for Bruce Bagley, who now faces a potential tenure in federal prison.â Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a Monday statement.

Bagley, who was released Monday on $300,000 bond, could not be reached for comment late Monday night. His attorney, Daniel Forman, told the Herald that he plans to âdiligently defendâ the case in court and fully expects that Bagley will be vindicated.",am

46,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police raided the home of Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor, adding to the graft scandals rocking President Michel Temerâs government.

Last month the Supreme Court opened a bribery probe into Maggiâs role in a scheme known as âmensalinho,â a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of Mato Grosso. He served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010.

According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, the raid was linked to a plea deal by former Mato Grosso state governor Silval Barbosa, who accuses Maggi of participating in the corruption scheme.

Barbosa was Maggiâs vice-governor, replacing him in the top job in 2010 when Maggi resigned to run for a seat in Brazilâs Senate. Barbosa was subsequently elected to a four-year term that ended in 2014.

Maggi denied any wrongdoing, claiming in a statement that Barbosa âliedâ in his plea bargain testimony.

âI never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have I obstructed justice,â Maggi said.

Maggi is a billionaire who was once Brazilâs largest soybean producer. His family firm Amaggi SA runs large farms in Mato Grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in Brazil with global firms like Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd.

Mato Grosso, where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities, is a major producer of grains and cattle. Raids were also conducted in SÃ£o Paulo and BrasÃ­lia, the police said in a statement.

The probe marks the latest blow to Temerâs administration, whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials, including the president. Temer has denied any wrongdoing.",am
47,"â -- A 27-year-old New York City-area woman has been accused of stealing and laundering more than $85,000, using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to support ISIS, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

Zoobia Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of money laundering. The five-count indictment was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York.

""The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" the DOJ explained in a statement. ""She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (""ISIS"") ... After consummating the scheme, the defendant attempted to leave the United States and travel to Syria. Shahnaz, a U.S citizen, was arrested yesterday.""

According to court records, Shahnaz worked as a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June of this year Around January of 2016, the government says she volunteered in Jordan with the Syrian American Medical Society.

Part of her volunteer work took her to a refugee camp where prosecutors said ""ISIS exercises significant influence.""

But Steve Zissou, an attorney assigned by the judge to represent Shahnaz, told Newsday that she never tried to help ISIS. He said she wanted to help Syrian refugees she met while volunteering.

""Whatever she did was for humanitarian purposes only,"" Zissou said.

Shahnaz is accused of fraudulently obtaining six credit cards and a loan from a Manhattan bank to procure more than $85,000 which prosecutors allege she then converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and laundered the money through overseas transfers, all with an intent to financially support ISIS. Prosecutors say the financial institutions she defrauded include American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Discover Bank and TD Bank.

Having never told her family she had quit her job in June, she attempted to board a flight at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport for Pakistan on July 31, with a layover in Turkey.

She was questioned by law enforcement officials at the airport, since her itinerary was suspect. Prosecutors said they believe she was trying to leave the U.S. for Syria and join ISIS.

""Her itinerary included a multi-day layover in Istanbul, Turkey -- a common point of entry for individuals traveling from Western countries to join ISIS in Syria,"" a court document stated. ""The defendant's return ticket had been booked for September 4, 2017 on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to JFK.""

But investigators believe Shahnaz had no plans to return to the U.S. She had allegedly done Internet searches for ""one-way tickets to Istanbul"" but purchased a roundtrip ticket. Prosecutors point out that ISIS recommends those wishing to travel to join ISIS to buy roundtrip tickets because they might be deemed less suspicious by law enforcement agents.

Agents said she gave false and conflicting explanations about her overseas wire transfers. She was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors want her held without bail pending trial.

Her next court date is January 5, 2018.",am

Arrest: Mariano Abete is the son of Mafia super-boss Archangel Abete
A baby-faced mafia don thought to be one of Italy's youngest-ever gang bosses has been captured by police in Italy.
Mariano Abete, 21, who is nicknamed 'baby-boss' in the Italian media, was arrested hiding in a secret room concealed behind a remote-controlled wall at his mother's house.
He had been leading the family in a turf war between rival factions of the Neapolitan Camorra which has already claimed dozens of lives.Â Â 
Abete had taken the helm after his father was arrested and his uncle murdered, and was wanted by police for mafia association and conspiracy to sell drugs.â¨
Despite his age, he was said to be powerful and dangerous.
Police swooped on the the house in Naples in the early hours of Saturday before closing in on his hiding place.
But as they began to break through the wall his terrified mother, herself aged only 39, is said to have intervened, begging: 'Please don't hurt him, I'll open it.'
Video of his hiding place, a minute cell hidden between two walls accessible only by a moveable wall operated by remote control, was last night circulating on the web.â¨
The narrow cavity contained only a mattress, a pillow, a crucifix and a cannister of oxygen.
ï¿¼
Abete is considered mafia royalty, being the son of the super-boss Archangel Abete, so-called because he led a splinter group rebellion against the ruling family.
He is also the nephew of another notorious mafia don killed in an ambush in September in a suspected revenge attack for the murder of a notorious mafioso known asÂ  'Wooden Hands'.â¨
The nickname derived from the fact that he wore prosthetics after losing his hands a decade ago when a home-made bomb exploded.
The hit was the latest murder in the vicious gang war being waged for control of drug trafficking in the Naples districts of Scampia and Secondigliano.",am
49,"One wishes one could say ârest in peaceâ. One can only say, âmay there be more peace for Zimbabweâs people, now that Robert Gabriel Mugabe has retired permanentlyâ. Zimbabweâs former president has died, aged 95.

His failures are legion. They might start with the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland and the Midlands, with perhaps 20 000 people killed.

Next, too much welfare spending in the 1980s. Then crudely implemented structural adjustment programmes in the 1990s, laying the ground for angry war veterans and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a strong labour union and civil society based opposition party.

In 1997 Mugabe handed out unbudgeted pensions to the war-vets and promised to really start the âfast track land reformâ that got going in 2000, when the MDC threatened to defeat Zanu (PF) at the polls.

That abrogation of property rights started the slide in the Zimbabwean dollarâs value.

From 1998 to 2003 Zimbabweâs participation in the Democratic Republic of the Congoâs second war cost US$1 million a day, creating a military cabal used to getting money fast.

Speedy money printing presses led to unfathomable hyperinflation and the end of Zimbabweâs sovereign currency, still the albatross around the countryâs neck.

In 2008, the MDCâs electoral victory was reversed with a presidential run-off when at least 170 opposition supporters were murdered.

Hundreds more were beaten and chased from their homes. Even Mugabeâs regional support base could not stand for that, so he was forced to accept a transitional inclusive government with the MDC.

Over the next decade, Mugabe was unable to stop his partyâs increasing faction fighting. His years of playing one group off against the other to favour himself finally wore too thin.

When in early November 2017, at his wife Graceâs instigation, he fired his long-time lapdog Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the generals with whom heâd colluded for decades turned on him. A coup petit ensued and returned Mnangagwa from exile, soon to be elevated to the presidency and heavily indebted to his comrades.

Where did Mugabe gain his proclivity for factionalism? And how did he learn to speak the language all wanted to hear â only to make them realise they had been deluded in the end?

The beginning

Mugabe and many other Zimbabwean nationalists were jailed in 1964. Ian Smith was preparing for the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and the first nationalist party had split into Joshua Nkomoâs Zimbabwe African Peopleâs Union and Ndabaningi Sitholeâs Zanu. Mugabe had been Nkomoâs Publicity Secretary.

As far back as 1962, Mugabe was registering on the global scales: Salisburyâs resident British diplomat thought Mugabe was âa sinister figureâ heading up a youthful âZimbabwean Liberation Army â¦ the more extreme wing of Zapuâ.

But almost as soon as Mugabe was imprisoned, a man in her majestyâs employ travelled down from his advisory post in newly free Zambia to visit the prisoner. Dennis Grennan returned to Lusaka having promised to look after Mugabeâs wife Sarah, known as âSallyâ. Grennan and people like Julius Nyerereâs British friend and assistant Joan Wicken played an important role in Mugabeâs rise.

The Zimbabwean nationalists emerged from Salisburyâs prisons late in 1974, as Portugalâs coup led to Angola and Mozambique emerging from colonialism into the Soviet orbit. The fifties generation of Zimbabwean nationalists were to participate in the Zambian and South African inspired dÃ©tente exercise. This inspired much competition for Zanuâs leadership: Mugabe arrived in Lusaka after ousting Ndabaningi Sithole, Zanuâs first leader.

Samora Machel, freshly in Mozambiqueâs top office, wondered if Mugabeâs quick rise was due to a âcoup in prisonâ. Herbert Chitepoâs March 1975 assassination (which got many of Zanuâs leaders arrested and its army kicked out of Zambia) was only one marker of the many fissures in the fractious party that by 1980 would rule Zimbabwe.

In late 1975 the vashandi group emerged within the Zimbabwean Peopleâs Army. Based in Mozambiqueâs guerrilla camps, they tried to forge unity between Zimbabweâs two main nationalist armies and push a left-wing agenda. They were profoundly unsure of Mugabeâs suitability for leadership.

When Mugabe found his way to Mozambique also in late 1975, Machel put him under house arrest in Quelimane, far from the guerrilla camps. In January Grennan helped him to London to visit a hospitalised Sally. He made contacts around Europe and with a few London-based Maoists.

Soon after Mugabeâs return the young American congressman Stephen Solarz and the Deputy Head of the American embassy in Maputo, Johnnie Carson, wended their way to Quelimane. Mugabe wowed them.

Solarz and Carson reported back that Mugabe was âan impressive, articulate and extremely confident individualâ with a âphilosophical approach to problems and â¦ well reasoned argumentsâ. He claimed to control the âpeopleâs armyâ.

Yet by January 1977, he persuaded Samora Machel to imprison the young advocates of unity with Zapu. His many reasons included their initial refusal to support him at a late 1976 conference in Geneva organised by the British, helped immeasurably by Henry Kissinger, the American Secretary of State.

At a hastily called congress in March 1977 to consecrate his ascension, Mugabe uttered his leitmotif: those appearing to attempt a change to the partyâs leadership by âmaliciously planting contradictions within our ranksâ would be struck by the âthe Zanu axeâ.

This was Mugabeâs strategy, embedded at an early stage: tell foreign emissaries what they wanted to hear, use young radicals (or older allies) until their usefulness subsided, and then get rid of them.

All the while he would balance the other forces contending for power in the party amid a general climate of fear, distrust, and paranoia.

Dealing with dissent

It is not certain if Margaret Thatcher knew about this side of Mugabe when they met less than a month after his April 1980 inauguration.

He seemed most worried about how Joshua Nkomoâs Zapu â which he had dumped from the erstwhile âPatriotic Frontâ, and the violence against which had put Zimbabweâs election in some doubt â was making life difficult for the new rulers. He warned that he might have âto act against them soonâ.

In as much as Zapu was linked with the South African ANC and Thatcher and her colleagues tended to think the ANC was controlled by the South African Communist Party, Zapu intelligence chief Dumiso Dabengwaâs perspective might be more than conspiracy theory.

Perhaps Thatcherâs wink and nudge was a green light for the anti-Soviet contingent to eliminate a regional threat. Gukurahundi followed.

It was certainly the biggest blot on Mugabeâs career and created the biggest scar over Zimbabwe. The scar is still there, given the lack of any effort at reconcialitation, truth, or justice.

Four years later the ruling partyâs first real congress since 1963 reviewed its history. Mugabe tore the Zipa/Vashandi group that had annoyed him eight years before to shreds. âTreacherous â¦ counter-revolutionary â¦ arms caching â¦ dubbed us all zvigananda or bourgeoisâ. Thus it âbecame imperative for us to firmly act against them in defending the Party and the Revolutionâ¦ We had all the trouble-makers detainedâ.

The great helmsman recounted the youthful dissentersâ arrest and repeated the axe phraseology.

But few saw these sides of Mugabeâs character soon enough; those who did were summarily shut up.

The end

After heâd been ousted, Mugabe could only look on in seeming despair over the ruination he had created.

Sanctimonious as ever he wondered how his successor, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, had become such an ogre.

At his 95th birthday, February 21 2019, a few weeks after Mnangagwaâs troops had killed 17 demonstrators, raped as many women, and beaten hundreds more in the wake of his beleaguered finance ministerâs methods to create âprosperity from austerityâ, Mugabe mused to his absent successor:

""We condemn the violence on civilians by soldiers â¦ You canât do without seeing dead bodies? What kind of a person are you? You feed on death?""

He only had to look into his own history to see what kind of people he helped create.

50,"obert Mugabe is dead, never to come back again, and so are millions of Zimbabweans who preceded him, dying from easily treatable diseases, and from the violence that visited anyone who attempted to resist his tyrannical rule.

The dreams of millions of young men and women â who, to this day, roam the streets of Zimbabwe with university degrees but without jobs or any decent income â were extinguished long before him.

The fact that Mugabe died in a Singaporean hospital is the final act of betrayal by a dictator who destroyed the health system of a country that had saved many lives in the first 15 years of his repressive rule.

Yet he died overseas, where his healthcare needs blew millions of taxpayer dollars. The same taxpayer, meanwhile, canât even get a painkiller in Zimbabwean public hospitals.

Mugabe was the face of the Zanu-PF governmentâs violence, and he performed his role with decadent gusto. He built an evil yet extremely strong system of governance that has outlived him: since his inglorious departure, its signature acts of violence and torture have continued under Emmerson Mnangagwa.

In fact, anyone who might have expected life for the Zimbabwean citizen to have improved following his humiliating removal from power in a 2017 military coup will be disappointed to learn that, far from getting better, things have got worse.

I first heard about Mugabe in the late 1970s when I was a boy growing up in colonial Rhodesia. My father, a civil servant, used to listen religiously to Radio Zimbabwe, which broadcast from the Mozambican capital of Maputo. The station broadcast liberation war propaganda, and was run by Mugabeâs party, the Zimbabwe African National Union, Zanu.

Mugabe constantly gave motivational speeches to encourage the African population in Rhodesia to be resolute against colonial rule, and to work hand in glove with his guerrilla fighters. He was undoubtedly a hero to many black people in Rhodesia; a self-styled Marxist-Leninist guerrilla war fighter, he used to bellow into African homes via Radio Zimbabwe, and the black people of Rhodesia held him in awe. However, unlike Samora Machel, who hosted Zanu and its military wing in Mozambique, Mugabe was an intellectual revolutionary who never fired a gun in the field.

Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe, as he liked to be addressed, took over a country at independence that had a strong economy, second only to South Africa in the region.

His country was known as the breadbasket of southern Africa, with a mechanised farming sector that was the bedrock of its economy and second to none. The economy had robust light and heavy industry sectors that had been built and accentuated on the back of a colonial import substitution policy, which successfully frustrated UN sanctions against Rhodesia.

The list of Zimbabweâs brokenness is long, and it is a list that defines Mugabeâs legacy and violent reign

At independence, Zimbabwe provided jobs to all who wished to work, but Mugabeâs most important legacy was an education policy that gave access to all Zimbabweans who desired to better their lives through formal education.

This created one of Africaâs most revolutionary education stories. It made Zimbabwe the African leader in literacy. Healthcare was available to all who needed it. Mugabe, however, turned his back on these early achievements and squandered their legacy. His rule became defined by bloody, murderous excesses that claimed thousands of lives and were largely ignored by the west; by political repression and a tanking economy.

Today Zimbabwe is a failed state because it has no capability of providing services to its people. The government-controlled power company can only provide six hours of electricity a day. Hospitals have been turned into death traps; there is no medication for the poorest of the poor. The country canât even provide passports for those who want to leave â the home affairs ministry can only produce 80 a day, where 8,000 should be normal.

There is no fuel due to an acute shortage of foreign exchange caused by corruption and lack of investment. Long queues are a daily reality. The unemployment rate hovers around 90-95%, with many Zimbabweans who are educated to degree level selling newspapers and cigarettes at street corners. Inflation stands at around 550% a year and most food is beyond the reach of the poor. Teachers earn an equivalent of Â£23 a month and doctors are paid Â£87.

Back in the day, Zimbabwe and Nigeria were the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa that had television; today Zimbabwe is the only country of significance without commercial television. The list of Zimbabweâs brokenness is long, and it is a list that defines Mugabeâs legacy and violent reign. He will not be mourned by millions of Zimbabweans who still suffer the consequences of his incompetent and corrupt rule.",nam
51,"The Anti-Corruption Office (OA). directed by Felix Crous, withdrew the appeal against the dismissal issued in the case against Ricardo EchegarayÂ in February of this year. The state agency, which at first had appealed the dismissal because it was pending the completion of an expert opinion that was pending, now withdrew from its proposal and indicated thatÂ The prosecution had also not expressed its opposition to the favorable ruling for the former AFIP head., and therefore, the dismissal was firm.
ï¿¼
On February 20 of this year, Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral held in a resolution thatÂ there were no âconcrete elements to question the patrimonial situationâ of Ricardo Echegaray,Â that he had been denounced for illicit enrichment. The magistrate signed the dismissal arguing that, in the absence of delivery of the accounting expertise,Â There was no evidence to confirm that there was an undue increase in Echegarayâs assetsÂ during his time in public administration.
The appeal by the OA â already under Crousâs management â the only complaint in the case, recalled that the expert study ordered during the investigation had not yet been completed, and said that the magistrate had made a âprematureâ decision becauseÂ it was necessary to know the detail of that study that they described as âessentialâ.Â This work had been commissioned in 2015, a delay that was highlighted by the OA.
For Canicoba Corral, ânothing could be concluded from the totality of the evidence collected, which includes sworn statements, public deeds, bank movements, credit card expenses and insurance policies, added to the number of years of investigation and the search for data through the consumption and expenses perpetrated by Echegaray â.
Based in Chamber I of the Buenos Aires Federal Chamber, the appeal requested that the experts of the Court be summoned to complete the requested expert study and submit the corresponding report. Before this happens, whichÂ was to become a reversal of the Canicoba Corral rulingOn July 22, the OA presented a brief in which it mentioned that the prosecution did not appeal the decision of the dismissal.
There, he maintained: âI consider that this Anti-Corruption Office must be, in the current instance that is going through this process, to the action of the constitutional public prosecution exercised by the intervening Federal Criminal and Correctional Prosecutorâs Office, andÂ refrain from recursive activityÂ regarding the interlocutory under analysis. âThat is, with the signature of Crous,Â they gave up appealing.
Consequently, Room I issued a brief resolution to which it agreedÂ Clarion,Â which maintains: âIn response to the statements made by the representatives of the Anti-Corruption Office, the appeal filed must be expressly withdrawnâ and this caused the dismissal against Echegaray to be final.
The complaint
Echegaray began to be investigated for alleged illicit enrichment for the period 2004-2009, when he was in front of Customs. The complaint by lawyer Ricardo Mussa maintained that his assets had grown 2,500%.
Mussa denounced that Echegaray upon entering the State in 2004 had an annual salary of 174,608 pesos and at the time of the complaint 364,000. In addition it maintained thatÂ during 2008 he would have received two salaries simultaneously in two public administration organizations: ONCCA and AFIP, which would configure a scam. âIn her own sworn statement, she admits that she received by the ONCCA entity the amount of 133,322 pesos and by the AFIP 209,360 pesos in parallel, violating the âunrestricted respectâ of the Law of Ethics and Suitability in the Public Function.â
There was more. Towards the end of 2015, the assets of the former official K amounted to 7.6 million pesos, as stated before the Anti-Corruption Office. Among his assets was a property in the country Talar del Lago I, an apartment in Punta del Este, another in the Capital. It also counted two boats. At that time, he declared annual income above 6 million pesos.

52,"Hondurasâ Foreign Ministry confirmed that the United States government has requested the extradition of Jaime Rosenthal, marking the next step in the US money laundering investigation of one of the countryâs wealthiest and most politically influential families.

Foreign Minister Arturo Corrales told La Prensa that his office received the extradition request on December 24. Corrales said he will present the petition before the Supreme Court on January 4.

Rosenthal, a former vice president of Honduras and high ranking official in the Liberal Party, who also oversees the economic conglomerate Grupo Continental, was indicted by the US along with his son Yani, his nephew, Yankel, and a family lawyer last October for money laundering for drug trafficking and corrupt interests.

US authorities arrested Yankel October 6, a day before the indictment was unsealed. Yani reportedly turned himself in a month later.

Rosenthalâs defense lawyer, Marlon Duarte, responded to the recent announcement by saying that Jaime Rosenthal must face criminal charges against him in Honduras before he can be extradited, reported EFE. A Honduran court ordered Rosenthal to be put under house arrest in late November for suspected tax fraud.

InSight Crime Analysis

The extradition request is a clear signal from the United States that it plans on proceeding with the politically sensitive and economically damaging case. The indictment, and a US Treasury âkingpinâ designation of the Rosenthal conglomerate that accompanied it, effectively shuttered the family bank and put at risk as many as 11,000 jobs connected to the Rosenthal-owned companies.

When his son Yani â a political heavyweight in his own right â reportedly turned himself over to US authorities, it was seen as a possible attempt to provide legal protection for Jaime. If this was Yaniâs intent, it appears his actions werenât enough to shield his father.

SEE ALSO: Coverage of Elites and Organized Crime

However, it is unclear how soon Honduran authorities will turn over the elder Rosenthal, if at all. As Rosenthalâs defense lawyer correctly pointed out, the business magnate must first resolve any pending charges against him in Honduras before he can be cleared for extradition.

Further complicating the issue is the uncertain outlook of Hondurasâ Supreme Court, which is in charge of authorizing extradition requests. Officials are currently in the process of naming new judges to the high court, and the makeup of the bench could have an impact on Rosenthalâs fate.",am
53,"Georgia needs the port. And if it doesnât want to find itself sucked into a Chinese debt trap, it needs to stop tussling with Western investors. The arbitration filings came just days after Tbilisi backed down in another conflict with another investor, Frontera, an American oil company â under myopic pressure from Washington.

This latest escalation in the bitter public dispute over Anaklia is a blow to Georgiaâs national security for two reasons.

First, it is yet more evidence that Anaklia will not be built anytime soon; the arbitration process will make it difficult for the government to attract new investors. As the countryâs first deep-water port, Anaklia is an essential part of Georgiaâs plan to transform itself into a transit hub between Europe and Asia, a strategy intended to boost trade, integrate deeper in the Euro-Atlantic economic system, and ultimately pull Georgia out of Russiaâs sphere of influence.

The move by the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC) â which was founded by a rival to the head of Georgiaâs ruling party â came after the government blamed it for failing to raise enough money for the port and terminated its contract in January. ADC, for its part, maintains that the government made it impossible to attract investors.

The Anaklia saga also undermines Georgiaâs security by damaging its reputation as a safe place to invest. Georgian officials like to boast about their countryâs free trade agreements and high place in ease of doing business rankings. The ability to attract foreign investors not only spurs growth, it creates connections with American and European business communities and spares Georgia from having to accept predatory loans from China to build new infrastructure.

The ruling Georgian Dream party has always claimed it supports Anaklia. Behind the scenes, however, it has appeared to sabotage the project by refusing to provide guarantees to international financial institutions, and launching what smells like a politically motivated money laundering investigation against former ADC chairman Mamuka Khazaradze. Clearly there is a personal rivalry between Khazaradze, who has started his own political party, and the head of Georgian Dream, Georgiaâs de-facto leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.

The fact that such a strategically important project was derailed by domestic political squabbling does not reflect well on Georgia. Foreign firms will be less likely to invest there, especially in things like infrastructure projects which require long-term commitments. This should be a grave concern for Georgia, where FDI inflows have already fallen from an average of $1.8 billion per year between 2014 and 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019, according to government data.

Access to Western investors, businesses, and insurers â which requires those actors to believe they will be treated fairly â is a vital economic and security asset for Georgia. Investors bring more than capital and expertise; they form connections between business communities in Georgia and the West which in turn create political connections. If the steady march of bad press about Anaklia dissuades some Western firms from investing in Georgia, the country will be forced to choose between slower economic growth and new benefactors.

The obvious choice would be China, with its deep coffers and penchant for investing in dysfunctional countries along trade routes to Europe. This is not just a far-fetched hypothetical. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has cited the risk of Georgia âfalling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influenceâ as one reason Anaklia is so important. Chinese investment in Georgia would invite the same concerns about debt traps, a lack of transparency, and political influence that accompany Chinese investments everywhere.

Georgia is still a success story for democracy and free enterprise in a tough neighborhood. The Anaklia fiasco is a step backwards. Georgians must now recognize the danger of politicizing critical investments. Parliamentary elections in October are the perfect opportunity to voice support for Anaklia and for keeping their country open to foreign businesses.

Georgiaâs friends in Washington, meanwhile, should provide the kind of guidance that is based on principle, not favoritism. In April, Georgia prevailed in an arbitration dispute with Frontera, the American oil company, which the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration found had failed to pay wages and engaged in other unscrupulous behavior over the years. Instead of supporting Georgiaâs efforts to move on, some members of Congress (who took contributions from Frontera), tried to get the State Department to withhold aid to Tbilisi, tying â improbably â the Frontera dispute to Russia. Tbilisi had no choice but to cave.

Thatâs how Beijing and Moscow do business. If Washington wants Georgia to succeed as a transparent and free democracy, it should support the countryâs efforts to play by the rules â and support negotiations with the Anaklia Development Consortium.",nam

Introduction
Corruption probes that began in 2014 have reached the highest levels of the Brazilian government and corporate elite, implicating President Michel Temer, former presidents, and dozens of cabinet officials and senators. Operacao Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) and overlapping investigations have led to prison sentences for top executives and politicians, mass layoffs, and billions of dollars paid in fines.
The scandals have complicated efforts to revive the economy amid its largest downturn in more than a century. The countryâs biggest corporations have faced numerous setbacks, and the fallout from the scandals helped right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro sweep to victory in Brazilâs 2018 presidential election on a populist, anticorruption platform. Millions of Brazilians have demonstrated in favor of the investigations, and many hope that shedding light on the scandals will end the widespread corruption that has plagued their country.
What is Lava Jato?
Federal prosecutors led by Judge Sergio Moro launched Lava Jato in March 2014, after the Finance Ministryâs intelligence unit discovered unusual bank transactions involving the state-owned oil company Petrobras. They suspected that Petrobras was accepting bribes from firms, including the construction giant Odebrecht, in exchange for contracts.
Executives from both Petrobras and Odebrecht, including the latterâs former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, were sentenced to jail time. In April 2017, a U.S. federal court ordered Odebrecht to pay $2.6 billion in fines to authorities in Brazil, Switzerland, and the United States. The company had previously admitted to paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to officials in twelve countries. Facing financial losses that stem in part from the probe, the two companies have laid off more than one hundred thousand employees.

Â Â 
According to the public prosecutorâs office, by October 2018 Lava Jato had resulted in more thanÂ two hundred convictionsÂ for crimes including corruption, abuse of the international financial system, drug trafficking, and money laundering.Â More than a dozen other corporations and multiple foreign leaders have also been implicated in Lava Jato, including former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and former Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Another investigation, Operacao Carne Fraca (Operation Weak Flesh), was announced publicly in March 2017; it began as a result of Lava Jato and pursued allegations that employees of JBS and BRF, the worldâs largest beef and poultry exporters, respectively, bribed food inspectors to approve the sale of spoiled products. In the following months, the European Union suspended its meat imports from Brazil, along with China, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, and the United States. (Some of the bans were lifted soon thereafter, but EU and U.S. restrictions remain in place.) JBSâs heads, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, made plea bargains with prosecutors and resigned from their positions in May; their testimonies spurred a probe into President Temer. JBSâs controlling shareholder agreed that month to pay a record $3.16 billion fine after its executives admitted to bribing 1,829 politicians a total of nearly $600 million. The Batistas were arrested in September on charges of lying to the prosecution and insider trading.
Several other corruption probes that have overlapped with Lava Jato have resulted in more than a dozen arrests. These include:Â Operacao Panatenaico, which concerns alleged bribes paid by construction companies in exchange for contracts to build stadiums for the World Cup Brasilia hosted in 2014;Â Operacao Greenfield, an investigation into alleged fraud at the pension funds of state-run companies; andÂ Operacao Zelotes, which is looking into bribes allegedly paid by companies including JBS and Fordâs Brazilian subsidiary to tax officials to reduce their corporate liabilities.
Which current or former public officials have been investigated?
Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin has authorized prosecutors to open investigations intoÂ hundreds of individualsÂ named in testimony by Odebrecht employees as part of their plea deals. The list included four former presidents, eight ministers, some seventy members of the National Congress, and three governors. The most prominent politicians among those investigated include:
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Â The former president (2003â2011) was sentenced by Judge Moro in July 2017 to nine and a half years in prison for corruption and money laundering. Lula, who also faces charges in several other corruption cases, lost appeals and had his prison sentence extended to twelve years in early 2018. His loss of these appeals effectively barred him from running for political office, although his party subsequently named him as its presidential candidate in the 2018 election. LulaÂ ended his presidential bidÂ in September and endorsed former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, who lost to Bolsonaro in a runoff. The federal prosecutorâs office has referred to Lula as the mastermind behind the entire corruption scheme targeted by Lava Jato, and some officials from his administration are serving prison sentences for related crimes. He is often described as a mentor to his successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was his chief of staff from 2005 to 2010.
Dilma Rousseff.Â In office since 2011, President Rousseff was impeached and then removed from office in 2016, during her second term, after being charged with manipulating the federal budget to conceal the size of the countryâs deficit. Prosecutors never brought charges related to the Petrobras scandal against Rousseff, though she was the companyâs chairwoman from 2003 to 2010. A separate case, which was brought by the opposition, sought to annul Rousseff and Temerâs 2014 election victory over allegations of illegal campaign donations, but was unsuccessful.
Michel Temer.Â Rousseffâs one-time running mate and vice president took office in August 2016, after Rousseff was impeached. His name did not appear on Fachinâs list, but he has since been charged with taking bribes. JBS chair Joesley Batista handed over to investigators secretly recorded audio that purports to show Temer authorizing hush money for Eduardo Cunha, a former speaker of Congressâs lower house. Like Rousseff and Lula, Temer has denied the allegations against him.
Eduardo Cunha.Â Cunha was charged in October 2016 with accepting bribes worth $40 million and attempting to obstruct investigations into his activities. In March 2017, he was sentenced to more than fifteen years in prison for corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering. Cunha faces additional criminal charges as well.
Sergio Cabral.Â The former governor of Rio de Janeiro state was arrested in November 2016 on charges of accepting $64 million in bribes in exchange for construction contracts, including for World Cup stadiums. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison in June 2017.
Have the probes had economic consequences?
Brazilâs economic troubles predate Lava Jato. Initially thought to be a temporary downturn in the wake of playing host to the World Cup, Brazil fell beginning in early 2014 into its worst recession in more than a century. As the political crisis worsened, investment levels and consumer confidence suffered, leading to a 3.9 percent drop in GDP in 2015 and another 3.6 percent decrease the following year.
In the first half of 2017, Brazil saw its first quarter-on-quarter growth in two years, at 1 percent. But after the Temer recording was released in May, Brazilâs currency, the real, plummeted 8 percent, andÂ economists indicatedÂ that political turmoil would make it more likely that the country would sink back into recession. Unemployment in Brazil hit a new high in March 2017 at 13.7 percent, more than double the rate in late 2013, prior to the start of Lava Jato.
By the end of that year, though, Brazilâs economy showed initial signs of recovery. The Finance Ministry announced that GDP hadÂ grown an estimated 1.1 percentÂ in 2017, citing a drop in private sector debt and increases in investment and consumption. Unemployment and inflationÂ were fallingÂ and the benchmark interest rate was at anÂ all-time low of 7 percentÂ in December.
Temer has pressed Congress to approve a massive economic reform program that includes austerity measures meant to rein in government debt, which continues to rise. However,Â experts doubtÂ that he can move forward with reforms amid corruption investigations. Multiple iterations of Temerâs pension reform bill haveÂ floundered in Congress.
Meanwhile, the companies at the center of the scandals, some of the countryâs largest, have been confronted with deep financial consequences. By mid-2018, the corruption scandal was believed to have helpedÂ erase more than $250 billionÂ from Petrobrasâs market value. The oil giant has also lost billions more in legal settlements and other costs related to graft, including anÂ $853 million settlementÂ with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Brazilian authorities.
Where does the Temer administration stand?
Brazilian legislation provides sitting cabinet members and other federal elected officials with special standing; they can only be tried by the STF. Cases against politicians move slowly through the single court, which has traditionally been deferential to politicians, leading to âpractical immunity from prosecution,â writes Matthew M. Taylor, an expert on Latin American politics at American University.
In June 2017, the prosecutor-general charged the president with corruption for accepting a $152,000 bribe from Batista, and in September with obstruction of justice and racketeering. The charges failed to obtain the two-thirds approval required by Congress for it to move forward in the STF, and Temer survived anÂ impeachment voteÂ in August of that year. Even so, at least eight cabinet ministers or top aides have stepped down since Temer took office due to the revelations from Lava Jato and other probes. âHis kitchen cabinet has been decimated,â says Taylor. Several smaller political parties have withdrawn their support for the Temer administration.Â Â Â 
[Temerâs] kitchen cabinet has been decimated.
Â Matthew M. Taylor,Â American University
Â Â Â 
In December 2017, Temer sparked outrage by reducing the minimum amount of prison time required for nonviolent criminals to be considered for an annual presidential pardon. CriticsÂ argued that the softened termsÂ would likely benefit politicians convicted under Lava Jato down the line. The STF promptlyÂ suspended parts of Temerâs order, stating that âpardons are not and cannot become an instrument of impunity.â
Temer will vacate the presidency in January 2019. Bolsonaro has promised to crack down on rampant corruption and crime, blaming rising levels of violence on widespread graft among Brazilâs judiciary and law enforcement officials. He named Moro his minister of justice, proposed comprehensive anticorruption legislation, and supported tougher criminal sentences and theÂ use of deadly forceÂ on suspected felons. While his supporters believe such iron-fist policies will rein in corruption and crime, many analysts fear the measures will backfire, fueling violence against the state and causing Brazilâs prison populationâalready a leading source of gang recruitmentâto balloon.",am

â Designations Include First Sanctions Against a Madrassa Used to Train Taliban Fighters

WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai (Azmarai), a senior Al-Qaâida official, and Jamia Taleem-Ul-Quran-Wal-Hadith Madrassa, also known as the Ganj Madrassa, a school in Peshawar that serves as a training center and facilitates funding for al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. The activities of the Ganj Madrassa exemplify how terrorist groups, such as al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban, subvert seemingly legitimate institutions, such as religious schools, to divert charitable donations meant for education to support violent acts. Todayâs action is the first designation of a madrassa that is being abused by terrorist organizations. This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan.

âTodayâs action strikes at the heart of the financial and logistical support network that abuses charitable donations and provides essential services for various terrorist groups including al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. These networks provide the fighters, training, and supplies for these terrorist groups to carry out their acts of violence against coalition forces and civilians alike,â said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. âWe will continue to work with our partners around the world to dismantle these terrorist networks, especially those that try to conceal their sinister activities behind critical community organizations like madrassas.â

During his long tenure with al-Qaâida, Azmarai has held a number of important positions. He is al-Qaâidaâs leader in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, Pakistan, and has been a significant financial facilitator for the group, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of its leadership and operations. Azmarai has also acted as a courier for al-Qaâida officials and has managed logistics for family members of senior al-Qaâida leadership, including Usama bin Laden.

Treasury today also designated the Ganj Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is controlled by designated al-Qaâida facilitator Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah. Shaykh Aminullah was designated by both the United States and United Nations (UN) in 2009 for providing material support to al-Qaâida and the Taliban.

The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training center where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalized to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities. In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers. Shaykh Aminullah has directed donations provided for the school to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which use the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan.

The Ganj Madrassa was designated today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorist and their supporters, for being controlled by Shaykh Aminullah and for providing financial and material support to Lashkar-e Tayyiba and the Taliban. Azmarai was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 for acting on behalf of al-Qaâida.

As a result of todayâs designation, any assets these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.

Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai

In addition to his financial activities on behalf of al-Qaâida, Azmarai has been active in multiple other facilitation duties for al-Qaâida. As of early 2012, Azmarai facilitated the procurement of secure areas in Pakistan for al-Qaâida to house militants and store vehicles. Azmarai has frequently acted as a courier within Pakistan for al-Qaâida leaders and other al-Qaâida facilitators. As of early 2003, Azmarai was a courier between al-Qaâida cells in Pakistan and the Persian Gulf and, as of late 2002, was a courier for senior al-Qaâida operational planner Khalid Shaykh Muhammad.

Azmaraiâs facilitation duties on behalf of al-Qaâida have also included providing logistical support to al-Qaâida members and their families. As of 2011, Azmarai assisted al-Qaâidaâs administrative manager with managing the care of important al-Qaâida membersâ families, including facilitating their finances, housing, and medical care. In 1999, Azmarai assisted in making logistical arrangements for al-Qaâida members and their families in Karachi, Pakistan. Azmarai was also specifically responsible for providing support to members of now-deceased al-Qaâida leader Usama bin Ladenâs family. Bin Ladenâs son-in-law selected Azmarai in late 1999 to look after bin Ladenâs family and, in mid-2000, Azmarai began working directly for bin Ladenâs family, facilitating their travel, lodging, and medical needs. From late 2001 through early 2002, Azmarai was responsible for bin Ladenâs family members in Karachi. In mid-2002, Azmarai worked for bin Ladenâs son, now-deceased Saad bin Laden.

Ganj Madrassa

Under Shaykh Aminullahâs leadership, the Ganj Madrassa has trained and harbored Taliban fighters who have subsequently been dispatched to Afghanistan. As recently as early 2013, Shaykh Aminullah was recruiting for Lashkar-e Tayyiba at the Ganj Madrassa and, as of late 2012, was hosting al-Qaâida operatives there.

Shaykh Aminullah has provided assistance, including funding and recruits, to al-Qaida. In addition, he directs donations received by the Ganj Madrassa to jihadist fighters battling coalition forces in Afghanistan and also uses the money to train madrassa students to become Taliban fighters. Shaykh Aminullah frequently travels to the Gulf to obtain charity donations on the madrassaâs behalf.

56,"A Harvard graduate and former research associate affiliated with the Kennedy School of Government and the Law School was found guilty of laundering drug money by a Luxembourg court on Thursday.

Jose Franklin Jurado Rodriguez '69-70, a native of Colombia and former resident of Dunster House, was sentenced to four years and six months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of nearly $150,000 by a panel of three judges, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

An associate of Jurado's was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $300,000, while a third defendant was acquitted based on insufficient evidence, the Journal reported.

Jurado, who concentrated in economics while at Harvard, was convicted under a 1989 law designed to stem the flow of illegally-earned money into the country's banking system. He and his partners were charged with laundering money on behalf of several cocaine kingpins.

But Jurado's lawyer, contacted by The Crimson yesterday in Brussels, said his client was not managing drug money, and that if he was, Jurado did not know it at the time.

Speaking in French, the lawyer, Jean-Pierre Buyle, said that Jurado was innocent and that the trial was unfair.

""It was a political judgment,"" Buyle said. ""Luxembourg is a small country in financial distress and [the government] is scared to be entangled with drugmoney.""

Calling Jurado ""an exceptional individual,""Buyle said he filed an appeal immediately afterthe verdict was handed down. But the attorney saidhe does not expect the decision to be reversed,adding that he will appeal to the Strasbourg Courton Human Rights, where he said an acquittal ismore likely.

Friends and associates of Jurado in Cambridgeexpressed surprise at the verdict yesterday.

Lecturer in Public Policy Mark A. R. Kleiman,who worked with Jurado for several months in thelate 1980's, said his friend told him that he hadfought against the growing financial influence ofdrug cartels while setting up a stock exchange inColombia in the first half of the decade.

Kleiman, who testified for Jurado before theLuxembourg court, said he thinks that what he sawof the prosecution's evidence was weak and thatthe judges were prejudiced against Jurado.

""Based on the process I saw in Luxembourg, thefact that he was convicted doesn't do very much tochange my belief that he's probably innocent,""said Kleiman, an expert in criminal justice at theKennedy School.

""I had the strong impression that the presidentof the court had already made up her mindthat...the defendants were guilty and regarded thepresence of defense lawyers and defense witnessesas an intrusion into what should have been asimple process of convicting everybody and sendingthem off to prison,"" he added.

Kleiman said he would probably testify again onJurado's behalf if asked to do so by the defense.

""If he was guilty, I'm extremely sorry to hearthat my friend Franklin Jurado took the wrongroad,"" Kleiman said. ""If he's not guilty, I'm evenmore distressed.""

57,"Malaysia has fined 80 individuals and entities, including politicians and businesses, for allegedly receiving money from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the countryâs anti-graft chief said on Monday.

The individuals include former Prime Minister Najib Razakâs brother, Nazir Razak, who was chairman of Malaysiaâs second-largest bank CIMB until his resignation at the end of 2018.

Former Malaysian trade minister Shahrir Abdul Samad, who was later the chairman of state palm oil agency Felda, and former deputy trade minister Ahmad Maslan were also issued compound notices.

Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysiaâs Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters on Monday that the agency was aiming to recover 420 million ringgit ($100m) from individuals and entities who had allegedly received funds laundered through accounts linked to Najib.

Funds had also been distributed to companies, political parties and organisations linked to Najibâs coalition, a list provided by the MACC and sighted by Al Jazeera showed.

This included entities under the previous ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and component parties United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress.

Malaysian and US investigators say about $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB, set up in 2009 by Najib.

âWe have issued compound notices against all of these people and entities for the purpose of them to pay up the fine,â Latheefa said, adding that they could be fined up to 2.5 times the amount received.

She said that the largest single sum being asked for was 134 million ringgit ($32m) from an entity.

Individuals who failed to pay their fines could face action against them by the MACC.

Najib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of corruption and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1bn in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.

A spokeswoman for Nazir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shahrir declined to comment.

In 2015, Nazir went on a leave of absence after the Wall Street Journal reported that he received about $7m from Najib and disbursed the funds to other politicians before elections in 2013.

An independent review into the money transfer concluded that Nazir did not misuse his position and there was no inappropriate use of the CIMBâs resources, following which Nazir resumed his duties as chairman. He resigned last year after almost three decades at the bank.

Nazir had received about 25.7 million ringgit in cheques, Latheefa said. She declined to confirm whether these were the same funds that Nazir had allegedly received in 2013.

After winning last yearâs election, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamadâs administration has reopened 1MDB probes, charged dozens of high-ranked officials, and filed civil forfeiture actions in a bid to recover money linked to 1MDB.

Since 2016, the US Department of Justice has filed forfeiture lawsuits on about $1.7bn in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds, including a private jet, luxury real estate and jewellery.",am
58,"The former president of an airline at the center of a financial scandal at Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison for fraud in connection with the failure of People Express Airlines in 2014 and the filing of a false income tax return.

Michael Morisi, 59, of Suffolk, is the former president of People Express which engaged in failed start-up operations at the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, according to court papers.

He pleaded guilty last July to wire fraud and filing a false federal income tax return.

He faced 23 years on the two charges.

Federal prosecutors said Morisi led the push to get the airline operational, despite a failed track record of getting private investments and significant outstanding liabilities.

A switch to a focus on the public commitment of funds led to PEX obtaining a $5 million loan from TowneBank that was guaranteed by the Peninsula Airport Commission. The loan was funded in June 2014.

Within a month, PEX had drawn down nearly the entire loan amount. PEX operated for approximately three months before suspending service. In the aftermath of the suspension of operations, various creditors sought repayment from PEX in 2014 and 2015, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

At the same time, Morisi opened new bank accounts to receive insurance proceeds and avoid the seizure of funds.

Morisi gave false representations to creditors (including the PAC, which paid more than $4 million to satisfy the TowneBank loan) claiming that no funds were available, according to court documents.

He made large purported back salary payments to himself and other executives in lieu of paying creditors, prosecutors said.

When the first bank account was made subject to a state tax lien, Morisi moved accounts again so that he could receive and divert additional insurance proceeds. He also filed false tax returns for three years omitting income and failed to file returns for two additional years, according to the U.S. Attorneyâs Office.

In early 2017, a state audit at the airport dug into the matter of the Peninsula Airport Commission using taxpayer dollars to back the $5 million line of credit.

The 2017 audit caused another airline, Elite Airways, to withdraw from a plan to start service to the Newport News airport, citing âchallenging perceptionsâ about the airport.

Former director Ken Spirito was indicted in May on several federal finance charges, according to an Associated Press report. The indictment includes charges of money laundering, and accuses Spirito of hiding public funds that were used to finance People Express Airlines in 2014.",am
59,"A reputed drug lord on the FBI's top 10 most-wanted list was captured in western Colombia, the interior minister said Monday, in a major blow to the country's largest remaining drug cartel.

Diego Montoya, who sits alongside Osama Bin Laden as the only major alleged drug trafficker on the FBI list, is accused of leading the Norte del Valle cartel and exporting tons of cocaine to the United States. The FBI had offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to his arrest.

The FBI says Montoya is sought ""in connection with the manufacture and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine."" It said the cartel is aided by left-wing rebels as well as right-wing paramilitaries.

Montoya's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, was captured by Colombia in January.

The Norte del Valle cartel became Colombia's most powerful after the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cartels in the 1980s and early 90s. Officials believe it is responsible for as much as 30 percent of the more than 550 tons of Colombian cocaine smuggled each year to the United States.

To protect its valuable drug routes, the cartel is believed to have worked closely with right-wing death squads whose umbrella organization, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, is listed as a terrorist organization by Washington.

Authorities have been closing in on the cartel since last year, when the army killed eight members of a private army believed to be protecting Diego Montoya.

A 2006 gunfight outside the Mi Casita psychiatric hospital left 11 Colombian police officers dead, and the police may have been acting on a tip that Montoya was hiding in the home, posing as a patient. There have been charges it was an ambush.

The Christian Science Monitor reports Montoya likes fast cars. Police in 2005 seized his personal mini racetrack last year, along with 74 ranches and eight houses. He is described as heavyset and gruff, and likes to be called ""El SeÃ±or de la Guerra (War).""

Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges. For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.

Most of those extradited have been low or midlevel drug traffickers. High-profile extraditions have included Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, brothers who helped found the Cali cartel.

Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States. Supply has remained robust despite record extraditions and eradication of coca crops.",am
60,"The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been sentenced to four years in prison by a Paris court for money-laundering.

Rifaat al-Assad was convicted of embezzling Syrian state funds to buy homes and offices worth â¬90m (Â£80m) to build a French property portfolio.

The 82-year-old former vice-president denies any wrongdoing. His lawyers say he will appeal.

His property assets in Paris and London will be seized, the court ruled.

Assad, who was hospitalised with internal bleeding in France in December, was not in court for the ruling and is unlikely to serve his sentence due to his age. His London property is believed to be worth â¬29m (Â£26m).

Who is Rifaat al-Assad?

He was once the second most powerful man in Syria - the military commander at the right hand of his brother Hafez, who led Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000.

Rifaat is known as the ""Butcher of Hama"" by some Syrians because of his alleged role in the bloody suppression of an anti-government uprising in the city in 1982 but he has denied any responsibility for the massacre. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people are estimated to have died.

Since 1984, when he led a failed coup against his brother, Rifaat has mostly lived in exile in France and Spain.

After Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat proclaimed himself his brother's legitimate successor. But Bashar became president.

When Syria descended into civil war in 2011 he called on his nephew to step down.

His lawyers say his political past is irrelevant to an investigation into his financial activities.

What is the case about?

Rifaat al-Assad has been under investigation in France since 2014, when the legal NGO Sherpa, which defends victims of alleged economic crimes, filed a complaint saying the value of his property empire far exceeded his known income.

Five years later, the French judicial authorities decided that he should stand trial for crimes allegedly committed between 1984 and 2016, including organised money laundering, aggravated tax fraud and misappropriation of Syrian state funds.

The trial opened on 9 December last year. Assad denied the charges, saying he was given gifts by the Saudi royal family.

His reported French fortune includes two Paris townhouses, a stud farm, a chateau and 7,300 square metres of office space in Lyon. Several luxury properties have already been seized by French authorities.

Assad and his family also have a portfolio of 507 properties in Spain valued at around â¬695m (Â£585m).

The properties were seized by the Spanish authorities in 2017 as part of a separate investigation into alleged money-laundering activities by Assad and 13 other people, who have again denied any wrongdoing.

This is the second trial of a member of a foreign ruling family in France on charges of ""ill-gotten gains"".

In October 2017, Equatorial Guinea vice president Teodorin Obiang received a three-year suspended jail term after being convicted of using public money to fund a lavish lifestyle.",am
61,"Zimbabwean anti-corruption investigators said Monday they are probing whether former First Lady Grace Mugabe fraudulently obtained a doctorate that she apparently received within months and the dissertation for which remains unpublished.

Grace, whose apparent desire to succeed her 93-year-old husband prompted the army takeover that eventually saw Robert Mugabe resign, was awarded a PhD by the University of Zimbabwe in 2014.

Critics argued at the time that Grace, 52, had not actually studied or undertaken research to earn the doctorate and that she had been handed her diploma just months after enrolling. PhDs typically require several years of full-time research and writing.

Her dissertation has never been made public, according to local media, breaking with the established policy of most Zimbabwean public universities to publish doctoral studentsâ theses.

The state-run Herald newspaper reported in 2014 that Graceâs dissertation was on the theme of âchanging social structure (and) the functions of the familyâ and that she undertook research on Zimbabwean childrenâs homes.

Grace was personally capped by then-president Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, and praised by other government officials who defended the controversial degree award.

âWe confirm there is such a report and there is such a probe,â said Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission spokeswoman Phyllis Chikundura who declined to provide further details.

In November 2017, Robert Mugabe fired then-vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a move that was seen as opening the way for his wifeâs succession. A few days later the military took control of the country, leading to Mugabeâs resignation on November 21.

Mnangagwa was sworn in as president days later and both Robert and Grace have kept a low profile since their spectacular reversal of fortune.

During the height of the upheaval, students at the University of Zimbabwe boycotted their end of term exams to call for Grace to be stripped of her PhD and Robert to be stripped of the presidency.

Grace was routinely accused of extravagant spending on luxury clothes and international travel, and of involvement in corrupt land deals.

Dubbed âGucci Graceâ, âThe First Shopperâ or even âDisGraceâ, she showed her political mettle in 2014 with her ruthless campaign against then Vice President Joice Mujuru, who was then a contender to succeed her husband.

A similar briefing campaign â conducted both publicly and behind the scenes â against Mnangagwa is widely seen as having led to her husbandâs downfall.

62,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated drug launderer Pedro Claver Mejia Salazar (Mejia Salazar) and his narcotics money laundering network based in MedellÃ­n, Colombia pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Treasury also designated Colombian national Fredy Alonso Mira Perez (alias Fredy Colas), an important underboss in the criminal organization known as La Oficina de Envigado, as well as 10 additional individuals, and 14 entities, all based in Colombia.

Mejia Salazar, often acting under the authority and direction of Fredy Colas, primarily launders narcotics proceeds on behalf of La Oficina de Envigado, a group which Treasury designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act on June 26, 2014. As part of his global drug money laundering operations, Mejia Salazar and his network work closely with Lebanese-Colombian drug money launderer Ayman Saied Joumaa, also a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.

âOperatives of La Oficina de Envigado have tapped into Ayman Joumaaâs international networks and successfully moved drug proceeds back to traffickers in Colombia from locations around the world, posing a major threat to U.S. interests,â said Director of Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam Szubin. âTreasury will continue to aggressively expose and disrupt the activities of these illicit networks, wherever they may be operating.â

Mejia Salazar relies on a network of trusted family members to carry out his money laundering transactions, including his sons â Juan Carlos, Victor Gabriel, Andres Camilo, and Jose Alejandro Mejia Alzate â and his nephews â Jesus Rodolfo, Jose Albeiro, and Jose Guillermo Barco Mejia. Several entities designated today, which are owned by Mejia Salazar and his family, are also directly involved in these illicit transactions, including Grupo Empresarial Enkor Profesional S.A.S., a well-known beauty products company based in MedellÃ­n.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been charged with three counts of money laundering linked to a multi-million dollar corruption scandal.

He is accused of having received 42m ringgit ($10m; Â£8m) from state fund 1MDB in his personal bank account.

Mr Najib was arrested in July and has already been charged with breach of trust and abusing his position.

The new investigation into 1MDB began after his shock election loss in May.

He has always denied any guilt and had been cleared by Malaysian authorities while in power.

Mr Najib, members of his family and several allies are accused of embezzling huge sums allegedly used to buy everything from artwork to high-end real estate around the globe.

The allegations played a central role in his defeat to a reformist alliance led by 93-year old political veteran Mahathir Mohamad.

Raids have been carried out in recent weeks at properties linked to Mr Najib and his wife. Police say the seizure of valuables - including designer handbags, jewellery and cash - was the biggest in Malaysian history.

1MDB, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn the capital, Kuala Lumpur, into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments.

It started to attract negative attention in early 2015 after it missed payments for some of the $11bn it owed to banks and bondholders.

Then the Wall Street Journal reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Mr Najib's personal bank accounts.",am

Spanish police have said two former IRA members - a married couple - were arrested last week as part of an investigation into money laundering and smuggling.

It has been reported that the couple are Leonard Hardy, 54, and Donna Maguire, 57.

They were arrested in Lanzarote.

Five other people were arrested and 11 searches were carried out in the provinces of Las Palmas, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia.

Spanish police said inquiries began following information indicating that money from tobacco and alcohol smuggling was being laundered through the acquisition of properties in different Spanish provinces on the Mediterranean coast and the creation of companies.

They said it involved properties with an estimated value of 10.5m euros.

The investigation has been assisted by Irish police and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

Hardy and Maguire are married with four children and live in Dundalk, County Louth.

Hardy, originally from Belfast, received a six-year sentence in Germany in 2006, after admitting his role in a failed IRA bomb attack on a British Army barracks at Osnabruck in August 1989. He walked free because the offence happened before 1998.

Maguire, who is from Newry, received a nine-year sentence in Germany in 1995 after being found guilty of attempted murder and explosive offences over the same attack.",am

The Senegalese, 87, faced corruption and money-laundering charges linked to the Russian doping scandal.

Diack was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was sentenced to four years in prison, two of them suspended.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".

Diack, who was also given a maximum fine of 500,000 euros (Â£456,928), was investigated by French authorities for four years over claims he took payments of more than 3m euros to cover up cheating.

The judge said his actions had ""undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping"".

Diack has been under house arrest in Paris since November 2015.

Previously one of the most influential figures in world sport, Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics' Federations - now World Athletics - for 16 years until he was replaced by Britain's Lord Coe in August 2015.

Diack's son Papa Massata Diack - who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 - was sentenced to five years in prison and a given a 1m euros fine (Â£913,850).

After the ruling, World Athletics released a statement in which it said it was ""disappointed this happened in our sport"" but ""grateful for the strong and clear decisions that have been taken against the individuals involved"".

Athletics' governing body added that it would like to ""reassure everyone that the reforms our congress approved in 2016 will ensure that similar actions by individuals can never happen again in our sport"".

""We are grateful for the damages awarded by the Paris Criminal Court totalling 16m euros for embezzled funds and for reputational damage suffered as a direct consequence of these crimes and the resulting media coverage,"" it added.

""As the court acknowledged, this damage has impacted World Athletics' finances and had a negative impact on World Athletics' image and reputation in a deep and lasting way. We will do everything we can to recover the monies awarded, and return them to the organisation for the development of athletics globally.""",am

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today added several members of the Camorra mafia to its Specially Designated Nationals List (â SDNL â).

As a result of the designation to the SDNL, all property (money, securities, and other property) of the designated Camorra in the U.S. or in the possession or control of a U.S. person, or U.S. company must be immediately frozen and cannot be dealt with in any way.

The sanction applies to a U.S. person, a U.S. incorporated company or entity, a U.S. based partnership, joint venture, trust, group or any organization (even if Canadian parented) and any foreign branches of any of those entities.

Banks, funds, brokers, trust companies and in particular, charge and credit card companies in the U.S. or situated elsewhere but with a U.S. parent or U.S. connection (such as American Express charge cards), need to take extra precautions to confirm they are not holding funds belonging to the Camorra designated today (or the Camorra designated by previous Executive Orders).

The Camorra operate internationally and are involved in serious criminal activity including money laundering, extortion, human smuggling, kidnapping, corruption, and counterfeiting.

The Camorra were identified as significant transnational criminal organization by President Obama in 2011 pursuant to Executive Order 13581, which requires the blocking of the property of transnational criminal organizations.

The designated persons are Marco Di Lauro, Mario Riccio, Antonio Mennetta, Mariano Abete and Rosario Guarino.

67,"The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

The notice from the NAB stated that former federal minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi, former secretary Ismail Qureshi, additional secretary Yousaf Memon and ex-secretary of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), Dr Naseem A Khan, have also been nominated in the case, as reported by Geo News.

The reference was filed in connection with the alleged illegal appointment of Basharat Hasan Bashir as a consultant for one of the country's top alternative energy board on a Management Position-II (MP-II) scale salary package.

According to the Express Tribune, the ex-joint secretary of water and power, Ghulam Nabi Mangrio, ex-section officer of water and power, Umar Farooq and retired air marshal and former chairman of AEDB, Shahid Hamid, are also among the accused in the NAB reference.

Allegedly, Bashir was appointed as the consultant in 2006 without following prerequisite procedures. His appointment also violated MP scale policy guidelines.

""After the expiry of his consultancy contract in May 2008, the accused Basharat Hasan Bashir illegally held the said post for almost 5 years without any extension, notification or regular appointment and kept on enjoying salary and all perks and privileges illegally in connivance with the management of AEDB,"" the NAB stated in the reference.

68,"The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has listed what it described as âcorruption allegationsâ against Senate President, Bukola Saraki.

The list is coming some days after Mr Saraki hinted on his intention to run for president in 2019.

In an interview with Bloomberg, the Senate President said he is âactively consideringâ running against President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 elections.

In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena on Monday, the APC raised alarm against the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in Nigeria.

âAgainst the backdrop of the litany of corruption allegations trailing the Senate President, Sarakiâs declaration, brings to the fore our earlier call to anti-graft agencies to check the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in this country. We reiterate our position that the Nigerian electorate must have the opportunity to choose from candidates that can pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.â

The party then went on to list corruption cases against Mr Saraki.

âLet us refresh our memory on some of Sarakiâs corruption allegations:

âAllegations of fraud which led to the collapse of the Saraki family-owned SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Bank (Saraki who was Director of the defunct bank was indicted over N1 billion alleged to have been looted from the bankâs treasury).

âMisappropriation of Kwara State funds, disregard of government due process and conversion of State government assets into his and cronies when he served as two-term governor of Kwara State.

âHistory of betrayals, treachery and sabotage â family, political party (PDP, APC), Senate, government.vSaraki was questioned by the Nigeria Police Special Fraud Unit over a N11 billion financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank.

âGluttonous property acquisitions and hidden multi-billion dollar assets spread across the world as disclosed by the Panama Papers revelations. The multi-million dollar white elephant Shonga Agricultural Project in Kwara State when Saraki served as two-term governor.

âFalsification of Senate standing order. Sarakiâs link to the N298m armoured Range Rover SUV seized by the Nigeria Customs Service. Sarakiâs link to $19.5 billion Paris Club Loan refund scandal. Oversaw budget padding in the National Assembly among other numerous corruption scandals.â

The APC accused Mr Saraki of being selfish in his political ambition and leadership of the National Assembly.

âNigerians should be wary of a man whose personal ambition will always supersede the interest of the majority and national interest as currently displayed in the National Assembly. While Saraki refuses to reconvene the National Assembly, the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is dangerously delayed, an action deliberately taken to sabotage INECâs ability to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2019.

âWhile Saraki refuses to step down as Senate President as rightly and severally demanded by the APC-dominated Senate, he is bent on foisting a PDP-minority rule (Senate President and Deputy Senate President) in the Upper Legislative House.

âThe only politics that Bukola Saraki plays is self, himself only and only himself. The interest and welfare of the people of Nigeria do not mean anything to him. Now it is the Presidency Saraki wants. And we ask with what antecedents is he doing this? Conspiracy, blackmail, treachery and vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other, as rightly captured by William Shakespeare. Bukola Saraki will rather rule in hell than serve in paradise.

âAhead of 2019 elections, Nigerians must ensure that we never again entrust the leadership of this great country to thieves whose sole aim is treasury looting and returning us to the dark ages where impunity and institutionalised corruption was the order of the day.â

Since announcing his defection to the PDP, the APC has insisted Mr Saraki must resign since his party âdoes not enjoy a majority in the Senateâ.

The chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomole, had attacked Mr Saraki, insisting he (Saraki) relinquish his position.",am
69,"Five fraudsters who offered a âgreen' tax efficient investment scheme to wealthy investors in order to steal millions from them have been ordered to pay Â£20,611,738.

The Oxbridge alumni used their former positions as a conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, a solicitor and merchant banker to persuade wealthy investors to put money into their âgreenâ investment scheme.

Investors were told their money would be spent on research and development into carbon credits, but only Â£16 million of the Â£65 million was actually spent on planting trees.

Instead the group stole Â£20 million of the investorsâ money and laundered it via bank accounts and secret trusts, spending it on luxury properties in London, Australia and Dubai as well as hidden off-shore investments. They also failed to pay around Â£6.5million in tax.

On Friday 13 December at the Old Bailey, Michael Richards, Rodney Whiston-Dew and Evdoros Demetriou have been ordered to pay Â£17.7 million collectively and if they fail to return the funds in the next three months, they face further time in jail. At an earlier hearing Robert Gold and Jonathan Anwyl were ordered to repay Â£2.64 million and Â£253,934 respectively.

Manjula Nayee of the CPS said: âThese men used their elite background to persuade people to part with their money, resulting in a huge loss to the victims and the public purse.

âSeizing these assets shows that we will do everything we can to ensure that criminals do not profit by exploiting others.â

The criminal benefit
To determine how much these men had profited from their scam âgreenâ scheme, the prosecution had to consider issues around ownership of different properties, international trusts, the corporate veil, tainted gifts as well as the effect of inflation, given the offences happened over 12 years ago.

They had laundered the proceeds internationally, hiding funds in accounts across China, the British Virgin Islands, Greece and Switzerland, which all had to be taken into consideration as part of the confiscation proceedings.

The vast amount of evidence gathered to support the case for their benefit amounts resulted in an opening argument of more than 100 pages for a heavily contested hearing which lasted two weeks.

The defence presented materials to show that each money launderer had little in the way of available assets, but the CPS was able to show these claims were false by identifying Â£20,611,738 of available assets.

Manjula Nayee continued: âIt is thanks to the dedication of every member of the prosecution team that worked on this case that, we could be confident the defendants had nowhere to hide. Now they must pay the millions they owe or face further time in jail.â

70,"Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Andrew Weissmann, and Assistant Director Chris Swecker of the FBI announced today that Timothy Despain, the former assistant treasurer of Enron Corp., has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

Despain, 39, of Houston, Texas, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Ewing Werlein at U.S. District Court in Houston. As part of his plea, Despain has agreed to cooperate fully and truthfully with the Enron Task Force's ongoing criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron. Despain pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the loss.

The information and plea documents signed by Despain state that Despain was an Assistant Treasurer of Enron from approximately January 1999 until May 2002. Despain was responsible for coordinating interactions between Enron senior management and the national credit rating agencies who rated Enron's corporate debt. Despain admitted that from 1999 through the fall of 2001, he and his superiors engaged in conduct that he knew was intended to fraudulently manipulate Enron's credit rating. Despain admitted that he knew this rating was relied on by the holders and prospective purchasers of Enron's publicly traded stocks and bonds. Despain stated that during this time period he was supervised directly by the people who served as Enron's treasurersâincluding Ben Glisan, who pleaded guilty in September 2003 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence.

Despain admitted that in communicating with representatives of the rating agencies, he and others at Enron did not truthfully present the financial position and cash and funds flow of the companyâkey factors influencing the company's rating. Among other things, Despain admitted that he and others falsely represented to credit rating agencies that Enron's cash flows from its non-regulated businesses were stable and predictable. In fact, the annual cash flow targets that Enron set for itself and reported to the rating agencies were arbitrarily based on what he and others believed was necessary to maintain Enron's investment-grade credit rating, rather than on the amount of cash flow Enron's non-regulated businesses were expected to achieve.

One example of such an improper transaction was ""Project Nahanni."" Despain admitted that, in late 1999, Enron was at least $500 million short of the cash flow target it had artificially set and then told the national rating agencies it intended to achieve for 1999. In order to make up this shortfall, Enron entered into Project Nahanni, a transaction that resulted in Enron reporting the sale of $485 million of Treasury securities as cash flow from operations. Despain admitted that he and others knew that there was no business purpose to the Project Nahanni transaction, other than to achieve Enron's desired cash flow results. Moreover, the sale of Treasury securities should not have been characterized as a sale of a merchant asset and therefore should not have been included in the cash flow from operations figures presented to the rating agencies. This transaction occurred during a time in which Enron was actively pursuing a credit rating upgrade from one of the national credit rating agencies. Despain stated that he knew at the time of the Project Nahanni transaction that if the rating agencies understood that $485 million of the reported cash flow from operations for 1999 was from the sale of Treasury securities, Enron's credit rating would have been negatively affected, and Enron would not likely have received the desired upgrade in its credit rating.

Despain also admitted that another mechanism by which Enron achieved the artificial cash flow targets it set for itself was through transactions commonly referred to within the company as ""prepays."" The reporting of the cash received from these transactions was a means of demonstrating to the rating agencies Enron's ability to recognize cash from its mark-to-market trading book. Although the prepay transactions were accounted for as commodity transactions and reflected on Enron's books as a trading liability, the transactions in substance created debt-like obligations to the financial institutions that advanced funds to Enron through the transactions. Despain and others told the rating agencies that the cash generated from Enron's trading operations was from the sale or ""monetization"" of trading contracts or the future cash flow streams from those contracts.

The agencies were led to believe that Enron was generating cash by selling an asset, when in fact Enron was generating cash by incurring a future obligation that operated as debt. Over the course of Despain's time as Assistant Treasurer, Enron's obligations under the ""prepay"" transactions grew to approximately $5 billion. Despain stated that he was directed by Enron's treasurers not to reveal to, or discuss with the credit rating agencies the nature and extent of the prepay transactions entered into by Enron.

Despain and the treasurers recognized that if the rating agencies knew about the nature and extent of Enron's prepay transactions, such information would have had a materially negative effect on Enron's credit rating.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division. The Enron Task Force also has coordinated with and received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

To date, 33 defendants have been charged in connection with the work of the Enron Task Force, including 24 former Enron executives. With the plea today, 16 defendants have so far been convicted. The Enron Task Force has obtained more than $162 million in forfeiture for restitution to victims.",am
71,"PARIS â

The Bosnian Serb general who led the 1992-95 siege of Sarajevo, a modern-day European agony in which more than 10,000 civilians lost their lives to snipers or wanton artillery shelling, was arrested on war crimes charges Monday by NATO-led peacekeepers.

A witness told journalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina that Stanislav Galic, 56, was detained after a jeep driven by peacekeepers cut off the car he was riding in in the northwestern city of Banja Luka.

Soldiers of the NATO-led Stabilization Force then reportedly smashed the car window, opened the door and forced Galic out. He was made to lie on the ground, his hands were cuffed, and he was bundled away by the peacekeepers, said the witness, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.

Galic was expected to be in The Hague within 48 hours for arraignment before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, officials there said. His arrest was a major development in the search for justice in Bosnia, where the siege of the capital--the first in Europe since World War II--came to epitomize the suffering of ordinary people in the Balkan republic, the callous ruthlessness of ethnic Serbian forces and the inability of the outside world for a long time to do much about either.

âFor 44 months, the Sarajevo Romanija Corps [commanded by Galic in 1992-94] implemented a military strategy which used shelling and sniping to kill, maim, wound and terrorize the civilian inhabitants of Sarajevo,â prosecutors at the U.N. tribunal in The Hague said in a statement after Galicâs arrest.

Under Galic, the prosecutors charged, Bosnian Serb troops in the hills overlooking the city âdirected shelling and sniping at civilians who were tending vegetable plots, queuing for bread, collecting water, attending funerals, shopping in markets, riding on trams, gathering wood, or simply walking with their children or friends.â

According to Bosniaâs Muslim authorities, 10,500 people, among them 1,650 children, perished during the siege, and more than 58,000 were wounded.

âThe attacks on Sarajevo civilians were often unrelated to military actions and were designed to keep the inhabitants in a constant state of terror,â prosecutors in The Hague said.

Galic was in command of the Romanija Corps when one of the most infamous incidents of the mostly Muslim cityâs ordeal occurred: the Feb. 5, 1994, shelling of the Markale outdoor market, in which 68 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded, some horribly.

The marketplace carnage, heavily publicized by foreign television crews and print reporters, moved the outside world to action. The U.N. Security Council threatened the Bosnian Serbs with airstrikes. Four days after the market shelling, the Bosnian Serbs accepted a cease-fire that was to last several months and agreed to pull back their heavy artillery about 12 miles from Sarajevo.

Galic retired from his command two months later. He became military advisor to Nikola Poplasen when the latter was elected to the presidency of Bosniaâs Serb Republic in September 1998.

In a secret indictment issued March 26 and sealed until Monday, Galic is charged with three violations of the laws and customs of war and four acts of crimes against humanity. He is the third senior Bosnian Serb commander arrested for alleged crimes during Bosniaâs 1992-95 civil war. Already in custody in The Hague are Radislav Krstic, charged with genocide in the massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, and Momir Talic, accused of leading a blood bath against Croats and Muslims in northwestern Bosnia in 1992.

âThis latest arrest of a retired major general in the Bosnian Serb army is in line with my policy of targeting senior figures in the chain of command for crimes committed during periods of armed conflict,â said Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor at the U.N. court.

Her spokesman, Paul Risley, said the only two senior figures of the wartime Bosnian Serb leadership who remain at large are the Bosnian Serbsâ then-president, Radovan Karadzic, and his military chief, Ratko Mladic.

This year, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and a number of high-ranking members of the Serbian leadership were indicted for alleged crimes in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslaviaâs dominant republic. They are still in Yugoslavia.

The leadership of Bosniaâs Serb Republic vigorously protested Mondayâs arrest, saying it jeopardized its attempts to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal.

Officials in The Hague and at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels refused to divulge the nationality of the soldiers who grabbed Galic, apparently out of fear of reprisals by Bosnian Serbs. Banja Luka is headquarters of the British-controlled sector of the Balkan republic, and its garrison of troops from the NATO-led Stabilization Force is largely British.",am

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Daveyâs bank account.

All dealings with the âsolicitorâ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

These 'aluminium wars' that led to gangland violence that claimed over 100 lives, but as a result, Abramovich is now worth an estimated Â£11.4 billion.

Abramovich is being sued at London Commercial Court, with 62-year-old Berezovsky claiming he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft, Rusal and ORT - oil, aluminium and TV companies respective - at bargain prices, from which Abramovich has now profited.

The court papers state that the Chelsea owner has accused Berezovsky, as well as the late Badri Patarkatsishvili or Georgia, of demanding money to help him emerge from obscurity.

""Prior to the August 1995 decree, the defendant informed Mr Berezovsky that he wished to acquire a controlling interest in Sibneft on its creation,"" stated the defence papers.

""In return for the defendant agreeing to provide Mr Berezovsky with funds he required in connection with the cash flow of ORT, Mr Berezovsky agreed he would use his personal and political influence to support the project and assist in the passage of the necessary legislative steps leading to the creation of Sibneft.""

Abramovich paid $500 million to Patarkatsishvili to protect him from the aluminium wars and the Chelsea chief has admitted he owes his success to the Georgian.

The papers read: ""Mr Patarkatsishvili did ... provide assistance to the defendant in the defendant's acquisition of assets in the Russian aluminium industry.""

The Times reports that Patarkatsishvili, who died aged 52 from a heart disease, was an infamous middle-man with organised crime. The court papers contend that the diseased confronted Abramovich at a Swiss airport, demanding he pay $1.3 billion to Berezovsky.

""The defendant agreed to pay this amount on the basis that it would be the final request for payment by Mr Berezovsky and that he and Mr Patarkatsishvili would cease to associate themselves publicly with him and his business interests,"" they read.

John Mann, a spokesman for Abramovich and Millhouse Capital, told AFP: ""It is an ongoing matter. While the case is ongoing, we won't be making any comments on it.""

It had thousands of suspicious customers, responsible for â¬200bn (Â£180bn) of transactions over a nine-year period. The realisation is dawning that what has been uncovered is probably the largest ever money-laundering scandal in history.

âEurope has a major money-laundering problem,â said anti-corruption expert Nienke Palstra, at campaign group Global Witness. âUntil we see senior executives held fully accountable for criminal wrongdoing and serious fines for the banks involved, this kind of scandal will continue for decades to come.â

Regulators and law enforcement agencies are slowly beginning to respond. Britainâs National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed it is investigating an anonymous corporate vehicle linked to the scandal. For the moment, this is a civil, not a criminal case, which means no individuals will be prosecuted.

The US is taking an interest. The justice department, the treasury department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US stock markets, are reportedly involved.

Denmarkâs regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, has reopened an investigation that it had closed in May. Its first inquiry resulted in a reprimand, but no fine. Now the authority will look at whether management should face legal action. Its head, Jesper Berg, told the Financial Times: âItâs easy to understand that thereâs a lot of public uproar. Itâs a continuation of the financial crisis. Thereâs this sense of unmet consequences for the financial sector.â

Before being rewarded with the top job, Borgen had been responsible for Estonia as Danskeâs head of international operations from 2009-12. The chief executive, in his resignation statement, said the report concluded he had âlived upâ to his legal obligations. There are concerns, however, that the person at the helm during a catastrophic failure of the bankâs internal controls is not leaving immediately. Borgen is being retained until a replacement is found and, as part of his contract, he is entitled to collect a yearâs pay.

Many questions remain unanswered. Even as the number of law enforcement agencies trying to tackle the Danske problem grows, doubts are mounting about their ability to bring prosecutions. Money laundering is a transnational crime. The Danske scandal involves 32 currencies, companies from Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands and the Seychelles. Customers of the Estonian branch have been traced to Russia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

One scheme run through the branch reportedly involved Azerbaijanâs ruling elite, and a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) fund used to pay European politicians and lobbyists.

âMoney laundering is a globalised industry and if you operate on a domestic basis you might as well not bother,â said Tom Keatinge, the director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. A former investment banker, Keatinge worked at JP Morgan for 20 years before turning his attention to combating fraud. âThe borders are immaterial to you when you are structuring these transactions, whereas the borders are not immaterial for the cops who are trying to chase you.â

Last week, the European commission put forward proposals to create the EUâs first genuine cross-border anti-money laundering force. The European Banking Authority will see its relevant investigations team increased from two people to 10, and the agency is to be handed the power to intervene where it believes national regulators are failing. But its mandate is limited to taking action against banks â it cannot prosecute their criminal customers.

Neither this weekâs 87-page report, produced for Danske by an independent law firm, Bruun and Hjejle, nor a 19-page memorandum by the Danish FSA outlining Danskeâs failings in May, have confirmed the names of any of the bankâs suspicious clients. Five years after staff in Estonia began raising the alarm, the only revelations in this area have come from investigative reporters.

The Bruun and Hjejle report makes a glancing reference to the most eye-catching name: the Putin family. It confirms that in December 2013, a whistleblowerâs account was sent to a member of Danskeâs executive board. The whistleblower named a UK registered company with an account at Danske whose beneficial owners were suspected to include âthe Putin family and the FSBâ.

Bruun and Hjejle referenced reporting by the Danish newspaper Berlingske, which last year named Igor Putin, a businessman and cousin of the Russian president, and a number of his associates, as the individuals suspected by Danske staff of having transacted money through its Estonian accounts. Putin did not respond to a request for comment from Berlingske.

The transactions centred on a UK-registered company called Lantana Trade LLP. Englandâs limited liability partnerships are notoriously popular for money laundering, because the information they are obliged to disclose is minimal. Companies House lists 50,000 active LLPs.

Lantana had filed accounts claiming to be dormant, according to the Danish FSA report from May. But Danske staff noticed in the summer of 2012 that it had an extensive history of transactions and a credit balance of nearly $1m. The alarm was raised with managers, but instead of closing the account, they allowed Lantana to remain a client until September 2013.

The NCA will not name the company it is investigating. The only detail given is that it is an LLP. In a statement, the agency did acknowledge the role often played by English companies in illegal schemes. âThe threat posed by the use of UK company structures as a route for money laundering is widely recognised and the NCA is working with partners across government to restrict the ability of criminals to use them in this way.â

The government says it is considering how to bolster the ability of the Companies House team to check the information provided by entities on its register. But for Keatinge, information gathering is not enough. âWe know that supervision doesnât get the bad guys,â he said. âItâs investigation that gets the bad guys.â",am

76,"Seven individuals were charged in an indictment in the District of South Carolina with laundering over $750,000 of fraudulently obtained funds, including over $390,000 obtained from a fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. The seven individuals used a variety of methods to launder the money, including laundering the money through a casino. The indictment also identifies over $2.1 million in funds from twelve different bank accounts allegedly associated with the fraud scheme as subject to forfeiture which agents seized.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Peter M. McCoy Jr. of the District of South Carolina; Special Agent in Charge Jody Norris of the FBIâs Columbia Field Office; Robert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, and Special Agent in Charge Kevin Kupperbusch of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) Eastern Region made the announcement.

Lauren Marcel Duhart, 34 of Stonecrest, Georgia, Joshua Bernard Smith, 39 of McDonough, Georgia, Steve Ronald Lewis, 43 of Snellville, Georgia, Christopher J. Agard, 41 of Marietta, Georgia, Henry Duffield, 58 of Belton, South Carolina, Jeremy Brandon Latourneau, 43 of Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Derick Keane, 43 of Spartanburg, South Carolina, were charged in an indictment filed in the District of South Carolina with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Duhart, Smith, and Agard were arrested this morning and appeared this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin F. McDonald of the District of South Carolina.

In May 2020, Agard submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application for his business, Wild Stylz Entertainment, LLC, to a financial institution. In support of the application, Agard submitted fraudulent supporting documents that made numerous false and misleading statements about Wild Stylzâs number of employees and payroll expenses. The financial institution approved and funded a loan of over $395,000. Agard disseminated the fraudulently obtained funds to other members of the conspiracy to conceal the true nature of their fraudulently obtained funds. On May 27, 2020, Agard made $200,000 counter withdrawal at a bank branch. On May 28, 2020, Agard withdrew $50,000 in cash and made a $96,000 counter withdrawal. In June 2020, Duhart, Smith, and Lewis requested that Hunt provide Duhart, Smith, and Lewis with bank accounts in which to deposit fraudulently obtained PPP funds. Hunt had previously participated in drug trafficking and financial fraud with two South Carolina business owners. The two South Carolina business owners agreed to let Lewis use their business bank accounts in return for a percentage of the fraudulent funds deposited in their account. Hunt provided the two South Carolina business ownerâs banking information and additional account access information to Lewis. During multiple recorded calls in early June 2020 Duhart, Lewis, Smith, and Hunt discussed the bank and wire fraud conspiracies. In one call, Lewis informed Hunt that the scheme involved fraudulent bank applications and that they needed to submit as many applications to the bank as possible by June 30th.

The indictment alleges that Agard also utilized his business, Wild Stylz, to launder the proceeds of other fraud schemes. In October of 2019, Lewis recruited Duffield to participate in a fraud scheme. As part of the scheme, Duffield allowed Agard to transfer $378,000 of fraud proceeds from the Wild Stylz business account to be deposited into Duffieldâs business account in return for a portion of the proceeds. After the proceeds were deposited, Roosevelt Hunt (who has pled guilty to related charges), Latourneau, and Keane withdrew the funds from Duffieldâs account by depositing checks totaling $200,000 at a casino. After gambling for less than two hours, Hunt, Keane, and Latourneau cashed out from the casino and left with approximately $198,750 in cash. Lewis met with Hunt to retrieve the cash which had been withdrawn from Duffieldâs account. Lewis delivered a portion of the cash he picked up from Hunt to Duhart.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29, 2020. It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.

The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

77,"A successor to Pakistani militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was killed in a US drone strike, has been announced.

Bahawal Khan, who also goes by the name Salahuddin Ayubi, has taken command of Mullah Nazir's group, officials say.

Mullah Nazir died when two missiles struck his vehicle in the tribal area of South Waziristan on Wednesday.

He headed one of four major insurgent factions in Pakistan's north-west and was a key figure in supplying fighters and support to the Afghan Taliban.

""Ayubi, whose real name is Bahawal Khan, was appointed as top commander of the group after Nazir's funeral,"" a Pakistani intelligence official told the AFP news agency.

Clerics and tribal elders had backed the appointment, a spokesman for the militant faction told the Express Tribune newspaper.

Bahawal Khan, said to be aged 34 and an illiterate former bus driver, is a long-time close associate of Mullah Nazir, the two men having fought together alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan before the 2001 US invasion.

BBC correspondents say Bahawal Khan is seen as hot-tempered, unlike his predecessor. But he is nevertheless expected to maintain the tribal consensus that Mullah Nazir had built up to keep his power base around the town of Wana largely peaceful.

In recent years there have been divisions among Taliban militant groups based in Pakistan's tribal areas.

'Significant blow'

Mullah Nazir was one of the most high-profile insurgents killed by US drones. The faction he led straddles the border with Afghanistan.

For the Americans, he is a prized catch, as he headed one of the three major militant groups in the Waziristan region that focused their attacks on Nato-led troops in neighbouring Afghanistan, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says.

But his killing will be viewed by some as a dent in Pakistan's preparations for the departure of foreign troops from Afghanistan, our correspondent adds.

Pakistan has worked hard to maintain a crucial strategic balance in Waziristan by forging peace with militant factions focused on the Afghan insurgency rather than on targets inside Pakistan.

Mullah Nazir had formed an alliance with the government and opposed the fourth main militant faction, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has concentrated its fire inside Pakistan since 2007.

He was also seen as an enemy of militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and was praised by Pakistan for expelling Uzbek and other foreign fighters from Pakistan in that year.

Observers say there have been fears that Mullah Nazir's death could upset this delicate balance, especially if the TTP, which is linked to the Mehsud tribe, is able to force an advantage in Wana.

In recent months, the TTP has also carried out a number of attacks against the Wazir tribe in Wana, including a suicide bombing in November that injured Mullah Nazir.",nam
78,"An international prosecutor has charged an ally of Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci with leading a crime ring responsible for a multimillion-dollar land scam and money laundering.

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) made the charges against Azem Syla and 38 associates on October 25.

Syla is a former member of parliament and prominent politician in Thaci's ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).

In a statement, Kosovo prosecutor's office said Syla's crime syndicate was involved in illegally acquiring public property in Kosovo worth around $33 million.

The prosecutor's office added that the 39 defendants cooperated ""to deprive Kosovo of socially owned properties through criminal activities including the falsification of verdicts and of other official documents, fraud and corrupt behavior.""

Prosecutors said the criminal gang had been operating since 2006.

Syla, 65, was arrested in April after he surrendered to authorities. He was a top commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War.",am
79,"Elusive cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee was arrested in Spain for tax evasion in the U.S., the Justice Department in Washington said.

McAfee is accused of failing to file U.S. tax returns from 2014 to 2018 and hiding assets including real estate, a vehicle and a yacht in the name of others, prosecutors said. An indictment returned in June was unsealed on Tuesday after he was taken into custody. Heâs being held pending extradition, the Justice Department said.

He was arrested on Oct. 3 at Barcelona airport while traveling to Istanbul, according to an official at Spainâs national police force, who canât be identified under internal policies.

U.S. prosecutors claim McAfee earned millions of dollars through the promotion of cryptocurrencies, speaking engagements, consulting jobs and the sale of the rights to his life story for a documentary, but never filed tax returns. Instead, his income was paid into accounts held in the names of others, prosecutors claim. He faces as long as five years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and a year if found guilty of failing to file taxes.

Itâs the latest legal complication for the eccentric software mogul, who was a person of interest in a murder in Belize, though not charged with a crime, and last year he was detained in the Dominican Republic for entering the country with a cache of firearms and ammunition. He was also briefly a candidate for president in this yearâs U.S. election, ending his run from abroad in March.

The criminal charges were announced just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued McAfee for promoting the sale of cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.

The commission claims McAfee recommended at least seven initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers from at least November 2017 to February 2018 without revealing that he earned more than $23 million to boost them. Heâs also accused of denying that he was being paid when asked by investors.

The SEC is seeking to force McAfee to disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, and to prohibit him from taking part in the issuance, purchase or sale of any digital asset securities and unspecified monetary penalties.

McAfee didnât immediately respond to a request for comment.

The commission also accused McAfee of claiming to be an investor or technical advisor, âcreating the impression that he had vetted these companies, that they were benefiting from his technical expertise, and that he was willing to invest in the ventures.â

When a blogger exposed that he was being paid, McAfee was still holding âvirtually worthlessâ securities from the offerings he promoted and encouraged investors to buy them â without revealing that they were his own securities and he had paid a third party to recommend them, according to the complaint.

McAfee also engaged in a practice called scalping, in which he accumulated large amounts of digital securities and promoted them on Twitter without disclosing his intention to sell, the SEC said.

McAfee founded his epynonymous software firm in 1987. Intel Corp., seeking to build security features directly into its chips, bought the company for $7.7 billion in 2010, with TPG and Thoma Bravo taking stakes later. In 2016, Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51% stake in the business to TPG for $1.1 billion. The company filed to go public last month.

80,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â Federal prosecutors charged Texas billionaire Robert Brockman on Thursday with a $2 billion tax fraud scheme in what they say is the largest such case against an American.

Department of Justice officials said at a news conference that Brockman, 79, hid capital gains income over 20 years through a web of offshore entities in Bermuda and Nevis and secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. Prosecutors announced that the CEO of a private equity firm that aided in the schemes would cooperate with the investigation.

The 39-count indictment unsealed Thursday charges Brockman, the chief executive officer of Ohio-based software company Reynolds and Reynolds Co., with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses.

Prosecutors also announced that Robert F. Smith, founder and chairman of Vista Equity Partners, will cooperate in the investigation and pay $139 million to settle his own tax probe. Smith, 57, stunned a senior class last year when he promised to wipe out the student loan debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse, a historically Black all-male college.

âComplexity will not hide crime from law enforcement. Sophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges,â said David L. Anderson, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California. âWe will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.â

Brockman appeared in federal court from Houston via Zoom Thursday. He entered a plea of not guilty to all counts and was released on $1 million bond, said Abraham Simmons, spokesman for the Northern District of California.

âMr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,â said his attorney, Kathryn Keneally, in an email.

Prosecutors said Brockman used encrypted emails with code names, including Permit, Snapper, Redfish and Steelhead, to carry out the fraud and ordered evidence to be manipulated or destroyed.

Brockman, a resident of Houston and Pitkin County, Colorado, is chairman and CEO of Reynolds and Reynolds, a 4,300-employee company near Dayton, Ohio, that sells accounting, sales and management software to auto dealerships. The software helps set up websites, including live chats with potential customers, find loans and calculate customer payments, manage payroll and pay bills.

Reynolds & Reynolds issued a statement saying the allegations were outside Brockmanâs work with the company and that the company is not alleged to have participated in any wrongdoing.

In 2013, a charitable trust set up by Brockmanâs late father withdrew a pledged $250 million donation to Centre College, a small liberal arts school in Danville, Kentucky, where Brockman attended class and once served as chairman of the board of trustees.

At the time the school said it was due to a âsignificant capital market eventâ that didnât pan out. A spokesman for Reynolds and Reynolds said in 2013 that the event was a proposed refinancing deal involving Vista Equity Partners, Smithâs company.

According to the indictment, Brockman gave an unnamed individual detailed instructions regarding the proposed gift to the college, including talking points, and directed the person to threaten to pull out if his demands were not met. In August, he instructed the person to cancel the gift.

Prosecutors say that Smith used about $2.5 million in untaxed funds to buy and upgrade a vacation home in Sonoma, California; purchase two ski properties in France; and spend $13 million to buy a property and fund charitable activities at his property in Colorado.

Anderson applauded Smith for stepping up, despite the serious nature of his crimes, which occurred from 2000 to mid-2015.

âSmithâs agreement to cooperate has put him on a path away from indictment,â he said.

In 2019, Smith announced to the graduating class at Morehouse College that he would pay off the student loan debt of the entire class, saying that he expected the graduates to âpay it forward.â The estimated cost was $40 million.

Forbes lists Smith as #461 on its billionaires list, with a net worth of more than $5 billion.

He founded the tech investment firm Vista in 2000 and Forbes reports that it now has over $50 billion in assets and is âone of the best-performing private equity firms, posting annualized returns of 22% since inception.â Vista has offices in San Francisco and Oakland.

This announcement follows accusations made against PeÃ±a Nieto by the former head of the oil company PetrÃ³leos Mexicanos (Pemex).

Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Pemex, was extradited from Spain in July to stand trial on corruption charges. He was accused of taking $10 million in bribes from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.

Lozoya accused PeÃ±a Nieto and PeÃ±a Nietoâs former finance minister of instructing Lozoya to give bribes of more than 100 million pesos to finance PeÃ±a Nietoâs 2012 presidential campaign. This money was allegedly given to electoral advisors abroad. Lozoya also alleged that PeÃ±a Nieto similarly used bribes to buy votes while he was in office, bribing one deputy and five senators for their votes on reforms in 2013 and 2014.

On opening the investigation, Manero said:

From this moment on, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has opened the corresponding investigation file and we will begin to carry out all the procedures. First the ratifications, then the presentation of witnesses, the expert analysis of each one of the receipts, and the video. And when the time comes, we will call the people he [Lozoya] imputes to testify.",am
82,"Papa Massata Diack has goaded French authorities by saying they will have to send special forces to Senegal if he is to serve a five-year jail term handed out to him in France for corruption and breach of trust.

Diack, the son of former athletics global chief Lamine Diack who himself was given four years in prison for corruption and money-laundering, refused to leave Senegal for the trial and was sentenced in his absence.

In 2016, the global police network Interpol issued an arrest want for Papa Massata, who has been based in his West African nation ever since.

""They can send special forces to pick me up,"" he brazenly asserted on Monday as he continued to protest his innocence.

Lamine Diack: Former IAAF head found guilty of corruption and jailed

Last week, 87-year-old Lamine Diack was convicted of corruption in France in relation to a Russian doping scandal and sentenced to two years in prison, with another two years suspended.

Diack profited from a scheme that allowed Russian athletes who paid millions in bribes to keep competing when they should have been suspended for doping.

Safe in Senegal where local authorities have refused to extradite him to France, his son Papa Massata, a sports consultant who was also given a fine of $1.2m for his role in the affair, has been disdainful of the investigation into corruption in athletics.

French investigators say Papa Massata is at the centre of years-long corruption probe that now spans Europe, Asia and the Americas, and includes the awarding of the 2020 Olympic Games to Tokyo and the 2016 Games to Rio de Janeiro.

In 2017, Papa Massata branded the accusation that he was part of a large corruption racket as ""the biggest lie in the history of world sport.""

Since last week's verdict, his lawyers in Senegal have said he was denied a fair trial and would appeal.

""I don't need to racketeer athletes - I earned enough money to live well,"" he said in the Senegalese capital Dakar.

""What France, the country of human rights, did is abhorrent. What we've seen in Paris was an offence to justice, a joke.""

Not only has he accused the investigation of having a political background, he has also warned that his father could reveal some hidden truths in the world of sports administration should he wish to speak.

""I'm not afraid to say that there is racism in this story,"" Papa Massata, who was banned for life from athletics in 2016, ventured on Monday.

""There is a will to do morality, but that's not law, it's not a legal process, it's a moral process. They do not respect Africans and they have shown that with Lamine Diack, they do not respect anyone.

""Let me tell you now: I will react to any disclosure published in the press, because I also know things. The day Lamine Diack speaks about the Olympic movement, let me tell you, the IOC will explode, Fifa, the IAAF.""

Following a huge scandal that has hung over athletics for five years, Diack senior - who led the IAAF from 1999 to 2015 - was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

In his testimony, he acknowledged slowing the handling of Russian doping cases between 2011-2013 to save a sponsorship deal with a Russian bank and avoid public scandal but he denied the corruption allegations.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".",am
83,"Penny Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, served as U.S. commerce secretary during President Barack Obamaâs second term. A longtime friend and backer of Obama, Pritzker has been a major donor to Democratic candidates and causes. To comply with federal ethics requirements, Pritzker committed to sell her interest in more than 200 companies within 90 days of assuming her Cabinet position.

In the data

On Dec. 7, 2011, a tax accountant associated with the Pritzker family provided Appleby with a copy of Penny Pritzkerâs passport to confirm her identity to enable transactions involving offshore entities that held portions of her family investments.

Two Bermuda-based firms â IAS Holdings and Triton Container International Ltd. â emerge in numerous Appleby files related to Pritzker family transactions.

Pritzkerâs investments in the two firms were included in a federal ethics filing in which Pritzker pledged to sell investments to avoid conflicts of interest. Federal ethics law limits Cabinet membersâ ability to âpersonally and substantiallyâ participate in government matters that could affect their financial interests.

Documents show that on June 27, 2013 â two days after her confirmation â Pritzker transferred shares in IAS Holdings and Triton Container to Delaware-registered DRBIT Investors LLC, which Appleby documents identify as being âowned by trusts that are for the benefit of Penny Pritzker's children.â A separate Appleby document lists DRBIT Investorsâ mailing address as the same as Pritzkerâs investment firm, PSP Capital. On the ethics form Pritzker filed the following year, IAS and Triton are simply listed as having been sold.

Penny Pritzker also showed up in Applebyâs records as shareholder of the Bermuda company THL Ltd. Pritzkerâs ethics agreement states that her stake in THL, listed as worth between $500,000 and $1 million, was sold on the same date she transferred shares in IAS Holdings and Triton Container to DRBIT Investors.

Pritzkerâs ethics forms value her interest in IAS Holdings at between $15,000 and $50,000 and her shares in Triton Container at between $1 million and $5 million at the time of the sale.

A Bermuda tax assessment sent to Appleby in July 2011 identifies IAS as an âexemptedâ company, meaning that it is exempt from local taxes, and notes that it will be subject to no new taxes until March 31, 2035.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - State prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro said late on Tuesday they have formally pressed charges against Flavio Bolsonaro, President Jair Bolsonaroâs eldest son, over his alleged participation in a scheme to siphon off public funds.

A former aide, Fabricio Queiroz, was also charged along with another 15 people whom prosecutors did not name.

Prosecutors have been investigating an alleged corruption ring in which Flavio Bolsonaro would receive part of the salaries paid to cabinet staff when he was a member of the Rio de Janeiro state legislature, a scheme known as ârachadinhaâ in Brazil.

Prosecutors say the alleged scam lasted between 2007 and 2018.

In a statement, Flavio Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing and said the accusations against him are baseless.

âI have not committed any crimes,â he said.",am
85,"Braun resigned as CEO on Friday, suggesting that Wirecard itself may have been the victim of a massive fraud. Jan Marsalek, a board member and chief operating officer at the company, was fired on Monday.

Founded in 1999, Wirecard was once considered one of the most promising tech firms in Europe. It processes payments for consumers and businesses, and sells data analytics services. The company has nearly 6,000 employees in 26 countries around the world.

Braun, who also served as Wirecard's chief technology officer, had led the company since 2002. The former KPMG consultant is the company's largest shareholder, with holdings of just over 7%, according to data from Refinitiv.

Wirecard grew quickly with Braun at the helm. The company reported revenues of over â¬2 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2018, or more than four times the figure from 2013. Shares hit an all-time high above â¬190 ($213) in September 2018, the same month Wirecard replaced Commerzbank (CRZBF) in Germany's list of top 30 companies. At that point, it was worth more than â¬24 billion ($26.9 billion).

The company now faces an existential crisis. A frantic search for the missing money ran into a dead end over the weekend in the Philippines, where the central bank denied the cash had entered the country's financial system. The company's shares plummeted on Monday, extending a crash that wiped 85% off its share price over three trading sessions. Wirecard ended the day with a market value of â¬1.7 billion ($1.9 billion).

Wirecard is scrambling to keep creditors at bay, a task that could be complicated by the arrest of its former CEO. The company said late Friday that it had hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to come up with a new financing strategy.

'Total disaster'

German finance minister Olaf Scholz described the scandal as ""extremely worrying"" on Tuesday, saying the country must act quickly to improve oversight of companies such as Wirecard. ""Critical questions arise over the supervision of the company, especially with regards to accounting and balance sheet control. Auditors and supervisory bodies do not seem to have been effective here,"" Scholz said in a statement.

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, said last week that it is actively investigating whether Wirecard violated rules against market manipulation. But Felix Hufeld, who leads the regulator and sits on the European Central Bank's supervisory board, described the scandal as a ""total disaster.""

""It is a scandal that something like this could happen,"" Hufeld said, in comments that were reported by Reuters and confirmed by the regulator.

The implosion follows a tumultuous 18 months for the company punctuated by allegations of fraud, attacks by short sellers and questions over its accounting practices.

The success story began to unravel in January 2019, when the Financial Times reported that Wirecard forged and backdated contracts in a string of suspicious transactions in Singapore. The company denied the report, which was produced with the help of a whistleblower, but its shares plummeted. In February 2019, authorities in Singapore said they would investigate.

Another blow landed late last year, when the FT published a report and company documents suggesting that profits and sales had been inflated at Wirecard outposts in Dubai and Ireland. Wirecard again denied the allegations. But an investigation by KPMG published in April found the company had not provided enough information to fully explain issues raised by the FT.

Braun explained his decision to quit last week in a letter to employees and shareholders.

""The confidence of the capital market in the company I have been managing for 18 years has been deeply shaken ... I respect the fact that responsibility for all business transactions lies with the CEO,"" said Braun.",am
86,"MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The white former Minneapolis police officer shown in video footage using his knee to pin an unarmed black manâs neck to the street was charged with murder on Friday in the manâs death, an incident that has unleashed four nights of violent protests.

Derek Chauvin, who was dismissed from the police department with three fellow officers the day after the fatal encounter, was arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges for his role in Mondayâs death of 46-year-old George Floyd.

Graphic video footage taken by an onlookerâs cell phone and widely circulated on the internet shows Floyd - with Chauvinâs knee pressed into his neck - gasping for air and repeatedly groaning, âPlease, I canât breathe,â while a crowd of bystanders shouted at police to let him up.

After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows unresponsive and ceases to move. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later.

The video reignited an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in Minneapolis and cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.

The charges brought by Hennepin County prosecutors came after a third night of arson, looting and vandalism in which protesters set fire to a police station, and the National Guard was deployed to help restore order in Minnesotaâs largest city.

Authorities had hoped Chauvinâs arrest would allay public anger and avert continued unrest. But defying an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Jacob Frey, about 500 demonstrators clashed anew Friday evening with riot police outside the battered Third Precinct building.

Police, creating a two-block buffer area around the precinct house, opened fire with tear gas, plastic bullets and concussion grenades, scattering the crowd.

Another group of protesters later converged near the cityâs Fifth Precinct station until police arrived and fired tear gas and plastic bullets to break up that gathering. A nearby bank and post office were set on fire.

Still, Friday nightâs crowds were far smaller and more widely dispersed than the night before. Law enforcement kept a mostly low profile, a strategy seemingly calculated to reduce the risk of violent confrontations, as was the case in several urban centers across the country where sympathy protests arose.

Among the larger cities with protests on Friday were Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Atlanta and Louisville, Kentucky.

A 19-year-old man protesting in Detroit was shot dead on Friday night by a suspect who pulled up to demonstrators in a sport utility vehicle and fired gunshots into the crowd, then fled, the Detroit Free Press and other local media reported.

Few if any other serious injuries or deaths have been reported in connection with the protests.

In Washington, police and Secret Service agents were out in force around the White House before dozens of demonstrators gathered across the street in Lafayette Square chanting, âI canât breathe.â

Thousands of chanting protesters filled the streets of New York Cityâs Brooklyn borough near the Barclays Center indoor arena. Police armed with batons and pepper spray made scores of arrests in sometimes violent clashes.

âHORRIBLE, TERRIBLE THINGâ

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, announcing Chauvinâs arrest earlier in the day, said a key piece of evidence in the case was the video clip showing Floyd lying face down in the street, with Chauvin kneeling on the back of Floydâs neck.

âWe have evidence, we have the citizenâs cameraâs video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again,â Freeman said. âWe have the officerâs body-worn camera, we have statements from some witnesses.â

Chauvin had his knee on Floydâs neck for nearly 9 minutes, according to an autopsy report. Medical examiners found the combined impact of being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.

Floyd, a Houston native who had worked security for a nightclub, was arrested for allegedly using counterfeit money at a store to buy cigarettes on Monday evening. An employee who called police described the suspect as possibly drunk, according to an official transcript of the call.

Freeman said the investigation into Chauvin, who faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted, was ongoing and he anticipated also charging the three other officers, identified by the city as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng.

Floydâs death recalled the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City, who died after being put in a police chokehold and telling the officers, âI canât breathe.â

Mike Griffin, a community organizer in Minneapolis, said the protests reflected years of frustration over economic inequalities and the feeling that black lives were not valued as highly by police.

He said anger has been building since the 2015 fatal shooting by Minneapolis police of 24-year-old Jamar Clark, and the 2016 killing of Philando Castile, a 32-year old black man shot by Minnesota police during a traffic stop.

âGeorgeâs murder was just the last straw,â Griffin told Reuters, calling the charges against Chauvin a step in the right direction, but adding there needed to be systemic changes.

The protests were driven in part by the initial lack of arrests in the case.

But Freeman stressed that charges in similar cases typically take nine months to a year, adding, âThis is by far the fastest weâve ever charged a police officer.â

Earlier on Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he understood why people had âlost faithâ in the police but argued Floydâs plight had become âlost in 48 hours of anarchyâ and called for an end to destruction of property. He has declared a state of emergency and called in the stateâs National Guard.",am
87,"WASHINGTON â United States senators have sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting that the U.S. Department of the Treasury update the list of sanctioned persons in Zimbabwe.

In a statement, U.S. Senators Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Chris Coons, member of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, said a new sanctions list is expected to have new names and removal of other individuals.

âWhile the United States has been the top provider of humanitarian and development aid to meet the needs of Zimbabweâs people, the government of Zimbabwe has implemented a misinformation campaign blaming the countryâs woes on targeted sanctions programs implemented by the United States,â said the senators.

Senators Risch and Coons said, âGiven the developments in Zimbabwe over the last two years, we urge you to consider enhancing the tools at your disposal, including the use of targeted sanctions, to incentivize changes in behavior by the Government of Zimbabwe.

âAn update to the list of the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list should incorporate a balance of new designations with appropriate removals.â

They further said, âit is important that the United States communicate to the people of Zimbabwe that our sanctions programs are aimed at deterring human rights abuses, public corruption, the undermining of democratic processes or institutions, and political repression in Zimbabwe. They are not aimed at the Zimbabwean people.

According to the Foreign Relations Committee, in 2003, the United States began to impose sanctions on select individuals in the ZANU-PF regime and entities known to facilitate human rights abuses, undermine the rule of law, and engage in the looting of state resources for personal or political gain.

It says while the targeted sanctions have been in place, the U.S. has continued to invest in humanitarian and development aid for Zimbabwe, spending more than $2 billion over the last 10 years. âThe government of Zimbabwe has used misinformation to blame U.S. sanctions for the countryâs political, economic and humanitarian situation.â

91,"Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, center, owner of England's Chelsea Football Club, arrives at court in London, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2011. Self-exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky has accused Abramovich of betraying and blackmailing him, as the two former business partners face each other in court, in a multibillion dollar lawsuit over an oil deal, where Berezovsky alleges breach of trust and breach of contract by Abramovich in dealings of the Russian oil company Sibneft. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)

LONDONâRussian tycoon Roman Abramovich paid $2 billion to fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky for his services as a political godfather in the turbulent years after the collapse of communism, Abramovich's lawyer said Tuesday.

The two former allies are facing off in a London court, where Berezovsky is suing Abramovich for 3.2 billion pounds ($5 billion).

Berezovsky, who lives in self-imposed exile in Britain, claims Abramovich intimidated him into selling shares in Russian oil company Sibneft at a fraction of their value. He alleges breach of trust and breach of contract.

Abramovich's lawyer, Jonathan Sumption, denied the allegation Tuesday, explaining that in corrupt and chaotic post-Soviet Russia Berezovsky was a ""power broker"" to whom Abramovich businesses paid large sums for patronage.

Sumption said that in Russia at the time, ""there was no rule of law.""

""The police were corrupt,"" he said. ""The courts were unpredictable at best ... Nobody could go into business without access to political power. If you didn't have political power yourself you needed access to a godfather who did.""

Sumption said the two men had agreed that ""for substantial cash payments, Mr. Abramovich and Sibneft would enjoy Mr. Berezovsky's political patronage.""

He said that between 1995 and 2002, Berezovsky, then a media mogul, received $2 billion from Abramovich businesses, as well as money for personal expenses including ""palaces in France,"" private planes, artworks and jewelry.

But he said Berezovsky did not put money into Sibneft, which was created during the breakup of Russia's state-owned businesses, and was not the registered owner of its shares.

""His contribution was important, indeed it was indispensable,"" said Sumption. ""But it was almost entirely political.""

Berezovsky, a Kremlin insider during the rule of Boris Yeltsin, fled to Britain after Vladimir Putin became Russia's president in 2000. He has since been a vocal critic of the Kremlin.

Berezovsky's lawyer, Laurence Rabinowitz, said Monday that relations between the two oligarchs turned sour after Berezovsky fell out with Russian political leaders. He claimed Abramovich then betrayed him in return for wealth and influence.

""It is our case that Mr. Abramovich at that point demonstrated that he was a man to whom wealth and influence mattered more than friendship and loyalty,"" he said.

Abramovich sold Sibneft to Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom in a multibillion-dollar deal in 2005. He now owns London's Chelsea Football Club.

The two men were at London's High Court for the first two days of the case, which is expected to last two months.",am
92,"Eta claim independence for seven regions in Spain and France

Three suspected Eta bomb plotters arrested in Britain last year have been extradited to Spain, police have said.

The three suspects include men aged 24 and 29 and a woman aged 36. They were arrested in April in Sheffield.

They are accused by the Spanish authorities of involvement in a 2006 bomb attack on a naval office building.

The names of the three extradited suspects are: Inigo Albisu Hernandez, 24, Zigor Ruiz Jaso, 29, and Ana Isabel Lopez Monge, 36.

Their extradition was ordered on 17 August last year. Their removal from the country follows all of their appeals having been exhausted.

Bloody campaign

The three were extradited on a flight that left at 1200 GMT.

Lawyers for the group had appealed against their extradition on the basis that the arrest warrants they had been detained under were defective.

The lawyers had argued that returning them to Spain would expose them to inhumane and degrading treatment.

At the time their extradition orders were made, City of Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the three suspects had come together as a ""reserve cell"" after a former ""command"" had been stood down.

Franco dictatorship

Melanie Cumberland, representing the Spanish judicial authority, said Ruiz was alleged to have carried out the February 2006 attack, for which Eta claimed responsibility, in Motrico, Spain.

No-one was hurt in the attack, although there was damage done to property.

For more than three decades, Eta waged a bloody campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France that Basque separatists claim as their own.

Euskadi Ta Azkatasuna, or Eta, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, first emerged in the 1960s as a student resistance movement bitterly opposed to General Franco's repressive military dictatorship.

Following the Spanish Civil War, the Basque language was banned - although it was being taught in private schools by the 1950s - the Basque's distinctive culture suppressed and intellectuals imprisoned and tortured for their political and cultural beliefs.",am

Conrad Black's full pardon came a year after publishing his glowing biography, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.""
The onetime media baron was convicted of fraud and obstructing justice in a scheme blamed for taking down what was one of the world's biggest newspaper companies.
Until being bought out, Black partnered with Mr. Trump in building Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago.

The name Conrad Black may not ring a bell for some Americans, but the onetime media baron, society figure and now a recipient of a presidential pardon was in the public spotlight for years. Deported to Canada in 2012 after spending more than three years in prison, Black had been found guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. His long and colorful history includes a long-standing alliance with President Trump.

Born in Canada, Black eventually became a British lord and is described in press accounts as a millionaire who lived like a billionaire. When criticized for allegedly using shareholder money to finance a vacation to Bora Bora and charging an extravagant birthday party for his wife to his company, he reportedly declared that he would ""not re-enact the French Revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility."" He was acquitted of charges related to both incidents.

""A President Like No Other""

In his 20s, Black and longtime business partner David Radler turned an investment in an English-language daily in Quebec into a company that ran more than 300 newspapers. He became a convicted felon decades later when he and other executives were accused of looting about $32 million from Hollinger International, which owned entities including the Chicago Sun-Times, Canada's National Post, the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. Radler pleaded guilty in the scheme blamed for taking down what at the time was among the biggest newspaper companies in the world.

When Black was at the helm, the Sun-Times in the early 2000s sold its building alongside the Chicago River to Mr. Trump, leading to the present-day Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago. The two were partners in the undertaking until Mr. Trump bought out Black.

The full pardon came a day after the National Review published an essay by Black headlined: ""Smooth Sailing Ahead for Trump,"" and a year after the publication of Black's book, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other."" The 74-year-old Black has authored other presidential biographies, including ""Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full,"" in 2007.

""Mr. Black is entirely deserving"" of the pardon, the White House said in a statement. It touted him as having made ""tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought.""

Maritime is an international business, and they work everywhere around the world. There is nothing secret or hidden,â Yildirim said.

Maltaâs corporate tax rate for foreign companies is 5%, compared with a 20% or higher rate for business profits in Turkey.

Yildirimâs sons Erkam and Bulent have registered companies in Malta, and Erkam is the director and main shareholder. At least one of the companies is involved in the buying and selling of ships, yachts and other marine vessels, as well as their financing. One firm is linked to an Istanbul-based entity whose shareholders have won state contracts from the Transportation Ministry, Cumhuriyet said.

Other Yildirim relatives are involved in three more companies registered in Malta, and still other relatives and friends with companies based in Turkey have links to firms in Malta, the paper said.

It also said separate documents showed Erkam Yildirim won a $7 million government tender this year, despite the prime ministerâs recommendation that his children avoid doing business with the Turkish state.

Yildirim told reporters he was willing to be subjected to â all financial and legal investigations â in the matter.

Parliamentâs third-biggest party, the Peoplesâ Democratic Party (HDP), has submitted a motion for an investigation, and the main opposition Republican Peopleâs Party (CHP) has said it too will submit a proposal to look into the offshore wealth of elected officials and their relatives.

âAs the government seeks to stop the Turkish economyâs downward trend, it has raised taxes on citizens, turning it into a âtax hell.â Tax increases have reached 40%, unsettling the public, while the names of those close to the president, prime minister and other high-level politicians appear in the documents of a âtax paradise,â wounding the publicâs conscience,â wrote HDP group deputy chairwoman Filiz Kerestecioglu in the motion, according to an emailed copy obtained by Al-Monitor.

Aykut Erdogdu, the CHPâs deputy chairman, said Yildirimâs call for an investigation was a direct challenge to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who dismissed Yildirimâs predecessor after he spoke out against corruption.

Cumhuriyet found the names of Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdoganâs son-in-law, and his brother Serhat Albayrak in the Paradise Papers. Dozens of offshore companies were allegedly set up with links to Calik Holding, a Turkish energy-to-textiles conglomerate, when Berat and Serhat were running the Istanbul-based company, it said. Serhat is listed as the director of one Malta-based firm that is no longer active and whose activities were never included in Calikâs financial reports, it reported.

In total, 93 Turkish people and companies appear in the Paradise Papers, according to Cumhuriyet.

On Wednesday, Cumhuriyet reported that hotel developer Fettah Tamince, known for declaring his love for Erdogan, has offshore companies in Malta and the Virgin Islands that he allegedly used to avoid paying taxes on his hotel investments.

Coverage of the Paradise Papers has been scant in the Turkish press, but social media lit up with the revelations. Twitter users pointed out that of the four accounts Yildirimâs official account follows, one of them belongs to Malta President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca. Yildirimâs office issued a statement saying he only followed her after she followed him.

Cumhuriyet, one of Turkeyâs oldest dailies, is at the center of a criminal trial in which 17 of its staff members are accused of aiding terrorism in connection with the paperâs critical coverage of the government.

The Istanbul-based paper joined hundreds of colleagues from 96 media organizations around the world to examine the Paradise Papers as part of an investigation by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The latest release followed last yearâs Panama Papers, when nearly 12 million documents were leaked to reveal legal information about more than 200,000 offshore businesses.",nam
97,"Switzerland and Uzbekistan have agreed to the terms under which Bern may return to Tashkent some $131 million seized from the disgraced daughter of former President Islam Karimov. But activists say Uzbekistan does not have institutions to ensure the massive infusion of cash is not looted by regime insiders.

Gulnara Karimova stashed almost $1 billion in Switzerland, funds that prosecutors say were the proceeds from bribes that three foreign mobile operators paid her to receive operating licenses in Uzbekistan. In addition to the $131 million that Bern is prepared to release, about $700 million more is still frozen and could one day be made available to Tashkent under the same conditions.

The memorandum of understanding is not yet legally binding, but it is likely to be celebrated by Tashkent as evidence of President Shavkat Mirziyoyevâs reform agenda.

Dwelling on the corruption of the Karimov era looks like a low-risk proposition for the countryâs current rulers, not least as it serves as another way of emphasizing the purported break with past practices. But the persisting restrictions applied to the work of independent media means that documenting the corruption happening today is still often complicated, if not outright impossible.

The fact that activists are having to demand transparency into how Karimovaâs frozen assets are used, should they ever be returned, and how reluctant the Swiss authorities have been in acceding to Uzbek requests for repatriation of that money, illustrates the continued lack of trust in the governmentâs anti-graft pledges.

Under the terms of the September 11 âframework agreement,â Tashkent will use the restitution transparently and accountably ""to improve the living conditions of the people of Uzbekistan"" and invest ""in projects which support sustainable development"" as defined by the United Nations. The memorandum calls for the ""establishment of a monitoring mechanism"" and says that legally binding agreements are to be negotiated ""in the near future.â

While praising Swiss officials for taking an important step, the Uzbek activists are calling for anti-corruption reforms to be implemented in Uzbekistan before the funds are returned, as well as a number of loopholes in the framework to be closed.

""Unless its proposed potential conditions are very strictly applied, the document will not succeed in preventing the restituted funds being re-appropriated by corrupt government networks,"" warned the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights and other civil society groups in a September 16 letter. ""The agreement requires evidence of further domestic reform given the political and institutional environment in Uzbekistan.""

Karimovaâs fall from grace began even before her father died in September 2016. She was arrested in Tashkent in August 2015 on charges including corruption and tax evasion.

Following a secretive trial, Tashkent regional court in December 2017 sentenced Karimova to 10 years of âlimited freedom,â which in effect meant house arrest. She later pledged to assist in recovering funds said to have been improperly acquired, prompting the court to commute the sentence to five years. In 2019, however, the court ordered Karimova to be moved to prison after finding that she had violated the terms of her house arrest.

In a letter addressed to President Mirziyoyev this past February, Karimova wrote that she was prepared to relinquish claims to $700 million held in frozen Swiss banks accounts in exchange for clemency in her case.

Far from winning her a reprieve, this attempt at negotiation appears to have landed Karimova in only more trouble.

In March, another court found Karimova guilty on multiple counts, including embezzlement and extortion, and sentenced her to 13 years in prison. The sentence is to apply from the date of her first arrest and will be served concurrently with earlier sentences.

Karimova was indicted last year on conspiracy and money laundering charges in New York, where she âstands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,â the Justice Department said in a statement.",am

Australia's Westpac bank has negotiated to pay a record A$1.3bn (Â£0.7bn; $0.9bn) fine for the nation's biggest breach of money laundering laws.

Last year, Australia's financial crime watchdog said the bank had failed to adequately report over 19 million international transactions.

Some payments were potentially linked to child exploitation, officials said.

The nation's second-biggest lender has apologised for its ""failings"".

Westpac is the second top Australian bank to pay huge fines for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

If the billion-dollar fine is approved by a court, it will be the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.

However, the fine could have been larger. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) said the transactions had amounted to 23 million law breaches, with each carrying a maximum penalty of A$21m.

Concerns about child exploitation came after Austrac identified payments made to suspected operators in the Phillipines. Australian media has since linked the bank to individual cases, including an alleged paedophile's suspected use of Westpac's transfer system to pay for child sex overseas.

""The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,"" said former chairman Lindsay Maxsted last year.

He and Westpac's former chief executive left their positions last year over the scandal.

""We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again,"" said chief executive Peter King in a statement on Thursday.

Westpac self-reported some of the breaches to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) last year. It also disclosed the investigation to shareholders, including a forecast penalty.

The bank said on Thursday it had reached an agreement to settle the court case waged by Austrac.

Most of the breaches concerned the bank's failure to report international transfers to the regulator, as required by law, in a timely fashion.

This amounted to more than A$11bn between 2013 and 2019, Austrac said.

It said the bank also failed to retain records and carry out due diligence checks with potentially high-risk overseas banks.

Austrac said there were also a small number of payments on accounts that were potentially linked to ""child exploitation risks"".

""The failure to pass on information... undermines the integrity of Australia's financial system and hinders Austrac's ability to track down the origins of financial transactions, when required to support police investigations,"" said the regulator's boss Nicole Rose last year.

The cases comes amid several investigations around the world into top banks for their alleged failures to prevent money laundering.

HSBC, Danske Bank and Rabobank have all been involved in high-profile scandals.

In Australia, Westpac's competitor Commonwealth Bank paid an A$700m fine for similar breaches in 2018 involving 53,000 suspect transactions.",am

The Hollywood producer Riza Aziz, stepson of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Mr Aziz, who produced The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was detained in Malaysia and bailed.

US prosecutors have accused Mr Aziz's production company of misappropriating money from a multi-billion dollar state fund to finance the film.

Mr Aziz's stepfather and mother have both been charged with corruption.

Mr Aziz will appear in court on Friday to face charges, said Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia's anti-corruption agency.

He has denied any wrongdoing. His production company, Red Granite, has already settled a civil lawsuit with the US government.

Mr Najib faces more than 40 charges and is accused of pocketing $681m (Â£540m) from the state fund 1MDB, short for 1Malaysia Development Berhad. His wife Rosmah Mansor has been charged with money-laundering and tax evasion.

Both have pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors have said the money was used to fund an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. Raids on properties linked to Mr Najib after he was toppled from power in May 2018 uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars.

Mr Aziz was also questioned last year over allegations of theft and money-laundering.

DiCaprio won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor for The Wolf of Wall Street and thanked Mr Aziz in his acceptance speech.

The US Justice Department has also accused Red Granite Pictures of using 1MDB funds to produce the films Dumb and Dumber To and Daddy's Home. The company denies any wrongdoing.

In May, about $57 million was forfeited by the company and put into an account in Malaysia set up to recoup funds allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB.",am
100,"Ravindra Kishore Sinha, a former member of Rajya Sabha for the Bharatiya Janata Party's Bihar unit, recently promoted a series of misleading articles written by him through Facebook, where he brings up an already-debunked theory on SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic - being a human-made virus.

Sinha backs his theory by claiming that Japanese Nobel Laureate Tasuku Honjo had declared that the coronavirus behind COVID-19 is not natural, but human-made. In April, BOOM had already fact checked this claim and found it to be false.

While Facebook had stated earlier this year that it would not fact-check political ads, in March the company had pledged to limited the spread of misinformation and hoaxes around COVID-19. However, Sinha's political ads, openly spreading misinformation around the pandemic, have been allowed to run, with some of them still being active.

Is Someone Spreading Fake News?

BOOM spotted an Instagram post from Sinha's account, which is a screenshot of an opinion piece, titled, ""Is China hiding something?"", with Sinha's photo and his name in the by-line. The screenshot of the article, written for a publication named Business Ocean, was shared with the following caption:

""Japan's Nobel prize winner doctor has claimed that the #Coronavirus is made by China to create havoc globally. Read my article published in ' The Avenue Mail' on this matter.""

Sinha also shared the same screenshot from his official Twitter handle, stating, ""China made the #Coronavirus to attack the whole world without firing a missile,"" in the caption. BOOM, however, did not find any trace of a publication called Business Ocean on the internet, with the exception of this listing in Sulekha - a website containing details of companies and businesses around the country.

We also found a Facebook post that carried an article with the exact same headline, written for an Assam-based newspaper called The Hills Times. He writes:

""Dr. Tasuku Honjo, who is a Professor in Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine at the Kyoto University in Japan and received the Nobel Prize for Immunology, is reported to have said that this virus is man-made and that it has nothing to do with bats.""

Sinha also mentions in the article that Hanjo himself had worked in the ""Laboratory of Virology"" of Wuhan - a reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology, that has been the subject of many conspiracy theories around the pandemic.

Here are some examples of the misleading posts promoted by Sinha's page:

Sinha's official Facebook page, with over 15 lakh followers, was found to promote at least 13 different articles by various publications/websites, which carried this conspiracy theory.

Fact Check

The rumours regarding Dr. Tasuku Hanjo making such a statement has been going around on social media since April 2020. On April 26, BOOM published a fact check, debunking this rumour and putting it to rest. Here is what we found:

BOOM visited the Nobel laureate's profile on the Nobel Prize winning website and the Kyoto University website to understand if he had ever collaborated with the Wuhan laboratory. However, there is no mention of Honjo working or collaborating with the Wuhan laboratory.

We also wrote to Honjo, as well as Kyoto University. The University refuted this claim and shared Honjo's official statement, where he said said that he was deeply saddened that his, as well as the University's name was used to spread misinformation.

""At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting,"" Honjo stated.

There is absolutely no evidence supporting the claim that Honjo made any claims relating to the origin of the COVID-19. However, we found that another Nobel Laureate - French virologist Luc Montagneir, had claimed in an interview that the virus seems to have originated in a laboratory.

In The Hill Times article, Sinha wrote while referring to Honjo, ""A report of his denial was circulated in social media subsequently but it was not taken seriously by many."" He however, failed to mention that the denial was official, and that it came from Honjo himself, which was published by Kyoto University.

Furthermore, he also adds in the article, ""In the light of this and the statement of France's scientist...."", making a dubious reference to Montagnier. However, the article does not mention his name at all.

BOOM reached out to the numbers mentioned in the disclaimers of the ads ran on Facebook by Sinha's page, but did not receive a response. We also reached out to Sinha through email and the article will be updated if and when he responds.

Given that Sinha's posts are political in nature, while also carrying misleading information around COVID-19, we reached out to Facebook to get a comment on whether such posts could be allowed under the garb of political ads. The article will be updated upon getting a response.",nam
101,"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday congratulated Joe Biden on his victory over Donald Trump in the US presidential election, urging closer ties between the two NATO allies.
Erdoganâs statement came a full three days after US media called the election in Bidenâs favor, underscoring the close personal bond the Turkish leader enjoyed with Trump.
But Ankara and Washington also experienced tensions during Trumpâs four years in office, including over US support for a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey views as a grave security threat.
âI congratulate you on your election success and convey my sincere wishes for the peace and welfare of the US people,â Erdogan said in a statement published by his office, urging âstrong cooperationâ between the sides.
Other issues standing between Ankara and Washington include Turkeyâs purchase of a high-tech Russian missile defense system, and US refusal to extradite a Muslim cleric Erdogan blames for staging a failed 2016 coup.
âThe challenges we face today, on the global and regional levels, require us to further develop and strengthen those relations, which are based in mutual interests and shared values,â Erdogan said.
Turkish officials have been alarmed by an interview Biden gave to The New York Times in December in which he called Erdogan an âautocrat.â
Biden criticized the Turkish leaderâs policies toward the Kurds and said Washington needed to âemboldenâ his rivals to allow them âto take on and defeat Erdogan.â
Erdoganâs spokesman said in August that the remarks showed âpure ignorance, arrogance and hypocrisy.â

102,"The verdicts in the corruption trial of former global athletics chief Lamine Diack, his son and four others will be handed down in a Paris court on Wednesday.

The older Diack, an 87-year-old Senegalese, who was in charge of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now renamed World Athletics, between 1999 and 2015, is charged with ""giving and receiving bribes"", ""breach of trust"" and ""organised money laundering"".

The prosecution alleged that Diack obtained $1.5 million of Russian funds in exchange for the IAAF's anti-doping arm covering up or delaying offences by 23 Russians to allow them to compete in the 2012 London Olympics and the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow.

Prosecutors have called for Diack to serve four years in prison and be fined up to 500,000 euros ($560,000).

Diack told the court it was his decision to delay bans after the athletes failed tests in 2011, but he denied knowing that officials from the body had directly or indirectly asked those athletes for hundreds of thousands of euros to hush up their cases.

He said he was acting to safeguard ""the financial health of the IAAF"" because the federation was negotiating major sponsorship contracts with Russian bank VTB and a Russian broadcaster at the time.

Diack, who was decorated in the Kremlin in late 2011, denied taking Russian funds to finance the successful campaign by Macky Sall for the Senegal presidency.

His son Papa Massata Diack, who worked as a marketing consultant to the IAAF, remains in Senegal, which refuses to extradite him. He has been tried in absentia on charges including corruption and money laundering.

In a press conference in Senegal's capital Dakar on Monday, Papa Massata, who is 55, declared himself ""innocent"" and argued that the French court had no jurisdiction.

He said he was not a French resident and that his companies are registered in his native Senegal.

Senegalese authorities are conducting their own investigation and he is facing similar charges to the ones filed in France.

Papa Massata accused British authorities of being behind the charges -- which he termed ""the biggest lie in the history of world sport"" -- in a bid to secure the IAAF presidency.

Sebastian Coe, who took over from Lamine Diack, is British and a double Olympic gold medallist at 1,500 metres.

- 'In the evening of his life' -

The court has heard that World Athletics is claiming 41.2 million euros compensation from the Diacks for loss of sponsorship.

Prosecutors are also seeking prison sentences for the former head of anti-doping at the IAAF, Gabriel Dolle, lawyer Habib Cisse who was Lamine Diack's advisor, as well as two Russian officials tried in their absence, the former president of the national athletics federation Valentin Balakhnichev and the former coach Alexei Melnikov.

Diack gave often inaudible and confused testimony. One of his lawyers, William Bourdon, asked that the judges ""do not take a decision that stops him from dying with dignity, surrounded by his loved ones, on his native land"".

The prosecution asked the court to punish a ""huge breach of probity that has caused worldwide damage"", even if Diack is ""in the evening of his life"".

The verdict will not mark the end of the Diacks' dealings with the French justice system. The father, a former International Olympic Committee member, and son are subjects of a second investigation on suspicions of corruption in the allocation of the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the postponed 2020 Games to Tokyo.

103,"Nine bodies were discovered dumped in a bloody pile outside a home Thursday in Nuevo Laredo, just across the Texas border, Mexican officials said.

Five women and four men were found with a handwritten sign left on top of their bodies, not far from an international bridge that connects to the U.S., a Tamaulipas state official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

The banner read, ""This is not a joke, nephew,"" according to photos from local media.

Such messages are often left by drug cartels as warnings to rivals.

Nuevo Laredo has long been dominated by the Zetas cartel, which has splintered into factions after the arrest or killing of top leaders.

The bodies were on a sidewalk near a sports complex at the intersection of Abraham Lincoln and Porfirio Diaz streets, The Laredo Morning Times reports.

""I just passed by that street and the people who live there were washing those sidewalks, the hideous blood odor,"" someone reportedly commented on a Facebook photo of the bodies.

The state prosecutor's office said it is investigating the killings.

Last week, IvÃ n ""El Taliban"" VelÃ¡zquez Caballero, who rose through the ranks of the Zetas, received a 30-year prison sentence for drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges he pleaded guilty to in 2014, the Laredo Morning Times reported.

The day before the discovery of the bodies, an old faction of the Zetas, La Vieja Guardia, threatened the younger generation of Zetas, the Cartel del Noreste, in a message that's circulating on social media, the paper reports.

""People of Nuevo Laredo, tell your children to stop frequenting the night clubs,"" the message states. ""All of the sudden, we will throw out grenades and burn down the clubs and everything that finances the Norestitas [CDN members].""

It was signed by Z-47 and Z-33.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A U.S. court sentenced the brother of jailed Colombian drug lord Diego Montoya to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Norte del Valle cocaine cartel and was responsible for managing its finances, including maintaining cartel stash houses to store the cash proceeds of drug deals, prosecutors said.

Montoya Sanchez was arrested by Colombian authorities after a shootout in January 2007 and was extradited to Florida in June. He pleaded guilty in January in a federal court in Miami.

Montoya Sanchez told prosecutors the cartel kept up to $20 million (14 million pounds) in cash in stash houses around Colombia. He said he used drug proceeds to invest in real estate and outside businesses, as well as to fund cocaine labs and pay lab workers, cocaine transporters and security personnel.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.

Diego Montoya, who was extradited to Florida in December and is still awaiting trial, was a leading figure in Colombiaâs underworld. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBIâs âTen Most Wantedâ list.",am
106,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Three months after taking charge of a new office created by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to compensate Mexicans for years of public sector embezzlement, its director quit, complaining the organization was tainted by corruption.

The blow to the Institute for Returning to the People What Was Stolen (INDEP) is one of several recent cases to blot Lopez Obradorâs image and undercut the message that his December 2018 investiture marked a sea change for a country awash in graft.

On Sept. 22, INDEP director Jaime Cardenas submitted his letter of resignation, raising concerns over alleged misuse of proceeds from auctions of stolen assets, and the suspected theft of diamonds, emeralds and sapphires from the institute.

To critics, the exit of his ally Cardenas is a symbol of Lopez Obradorâs failure to deliver on his anti-corruption pledge.

âLopez Obradorâs anti-corruption drive is much ado about nothing,â said Emilio Alvarez Icaza, an independent opposition senator. âItâs a great story, and a poor reality.â

Downplaying news which could embarrass him, Lopez Obrador routinely dismisses criticism as sour grapes from corrupt opponents, and points to landmark legislation he has passed that strips public servants of prosecutorial immunity.

Opinion polls show he has made up ground he lost early in the coronavirus pandemic, lifted by his anti-corruption drive.

Some give him an approval rating of over 60% as he gears up for national, state and municipal elections next June that will determine whether he can keep control of Congress.

Under Lopez Obrador, Mexico has moved up eight places in Transparency Internationalâs Corruption Perceptions Index to rank 130 out of 198 countries. Still, in 2019, the number of Mexicans who personally experienced public sector corruption rose 7%, according to the national statistics agency.

Cynicism over politicians is deeply entrenched in Mexico, where an old joke still makes the rounds that Alvaro Obregon, who ruled from 1920-1924, was the countryâs least corrupt president because he only had one arm with which to steal.

âNOT ENOUGHâ

Scandals have also embroiled the families of some of Lopez Obradorâs closest allies, including the son of a veteran politician who heads the state-run electricity company.

The son, who denies wrongdoing, was in July barred from doing business with the government for overcharging state health authorities for ventilators to battle COVID-19.

In August, videos surfaced of a brother of the president receiving cash in 2015 from a political operator who later won a post in Lopez Obradorâs administration.

Then, in September, a sister-in-law of Lopez Obrador, along with other local officials, resigned from the city hall of his hometown of Macuspana in Tabasco state amid what the opposition allege is a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal.

âIf the president thinks itâs enough for him to be honest to end corruption, thatâs wrong,â said Eduardo Bohorquez, director of the Mexican arm of Transparency International.

In each case, Lopez Obrador, who promised to show family and friends no quarter over corruption, said the revelations had been exploited by hostile media and adversaries to hurt him.

On INDEP, Lopez Obrador vowed to look into any complaints. But he called the resignation of Cardenas a political matter, and said there was ânothing to worry about.â

He vowed to have the footage of his brother Pio investigated, though no formal proceedings have begun. The cash handovers, Lopez Obrador said, were âcontributionsâ to his political cause and not comparable with previous corruption.

No proceedings have been brought against his sister-in-law Concepcion Falcon, who cited the âungovernabilityâ of Macuspana in quitting with her fellow councillors. Lopez Obrador verbally attacked the newspaper, Reforma, which publicized the case.

Lopez Obrador argues that high-profile prosecutions of ex-officials for corruption show he is âmoralizingâ public life.

One such prosecution involves Rosario Robles, a former ally accused of misuse of public funds in the last government. Another centers on a former head of state oil firm Pemex, Emilio Lozoya. Robles denies wrongdoing. Lozoya struck a plea bargain and accused his bosses of ordering him to channel bribes to politicians.

Lozoyaâs revelations have kept the spotlight on alleged past misdeeds by top officials and encouraged Lopez Obrador to press for a public vote on putting his predecessors on trial.

Despite concerns that such a referendum risks politicizing the normal passage of justice given that former presidents can already face prosecution, the Supreme Court this month declared it to be constitutional.

Lopez Obrador wants the referendum held the day of Juneâs mid-term elections. Even if that is not possible, his agitation over the issue may prove significant.

âKeeping the corruption issue alive is politically beneficial for him,â said Carlos Petersen, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. âLopez Obrador will use (the referendum) to score points before the 2021 elections.â",am

Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.",am

Last Monday, a call came in to BBC Television Centre, London, from the office of Mitt Romney's billionaire backer and âadvisorâ Paul Singer.

Singer, top donor to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee had a message for the news chiefs at the prestigious broadcaster:

âWe have a file on Greg Palast.â

I bet they do.

The purpose of the Singer call was clear: to smear the reporter whose broadcasts from Africa for BBC Newsnight, The Guardian and Democracy Now! had identified Singer as a âVulture,â a speculator profiteering from misery, mayhem, corruption and civil war.

Apparently, the Republican Presidential front-runner would prefer his sugar-daddies be known as âjob creators,â not predators.

âGreg Palast, Vultures' Picnic: In Pursuit of Petroleum Pigs, Power Pirates, and High-Finance Carnivoresâ is yours with a minimum one-time donation of $35, or a monthly commitment of $10 or more to Truthout.

And the Vulture really, really, doesn't like his starring role in my new book, Vultures' Picnic. I bet he doesn't.

Is BBC going to let Palast continue to investigate? The Romney money man added an unsubtle threat, âPalast has been sued before.â

Neither BBC nor The Guardian are backing down, bless'm.

What is in the file Mitt's billionaire has on Greg Palast? I'll show it to you myself, right here, if you have a little patience.

But it's not what's in Singer's file on me that's important â it's what's in my file about him.

You need to know: BBC has identified Singer as the Number One donor of the Republican Party in New York. His fundraising, in coordination with the Koch Brothers through a strange little group of far-right billionaires, is the cash-locomotive of the GOP.

How Singer âThe Vultureâ got his feathers, got that money that fuels the Romney and Republican causes is not a minor matter. Romney and the whole crew from Newt to Cain are selling us the line that Occupy Wall Street has it all wrong: calling for taxing or controlling the One Percent is a misguided attack on âjob creators.â

Indeed, one of Romney's demands is that I change the name of my book from Vultures' Picnic to Job-Creators' Picnic. [OK, I made that up.]

Let's begin with how Singer got his feathers.

I didn't give Singer the name âVulture.â His own banker buddies didâwith admiration in their voices. Like any vulture, he feasts when victims die. Literally. For example, Singer made a pile buying an asbestos company, Owens Corning, out of bankruptcy. Owens had knowingly allowed thousands of its workers to get deadly asbestosis, then concealed it. You don't want to die of asbestosis. Your lungs turn to mush and you drown inside yourself.

Singer, the Job Creator, used his political muscle to screw down the compensation workers would get. Offered them peanuts. And dying, they took it. With the asbestos workers buried or bought, the asbestos death factories were now worth a fortune â¦and Singer made his first âkilling.â

Then it was on to Peru where Singer had, through a brilliant financial-legal maneuver too questionable for others to attempt, grabbed control of the entire financial system of Peru. Most important, he seized the President's jet. When the scamp of a President, Alberto Fujimori, decided it was a good idea to flee his country (ahead of his arrest on murder charges), Singer, Peru's lawyer told me, let Fujimori escape in return for the Murderer-in-Chief ordering Peru's treasury to pay Singer $58 million.

But that's nothing. What really sent Mitt's man up a wall was my report from the Congos (there are two nations in Africa called 'Congo') where there's a cholera epidemic due to lack of clean water. Singer paid we're told about $10 million for some âdebtâ supposedly incurred by the Republic of Congo. Congo would pay the $10 million, but Singer had begun seizing about $400 million in the poor nation's assets.

The former Deputy Secretary of the UN said about the vultures, âyou are causing babies to die.â

It's legal, it's sick, it's Singer.

Well, not legal in most of the civilized world. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said about Singer and his fellow crew, âI deplore the activities of so-called Vulture Funds, [they] are nothing short of scandalous.â Britain has outlawed Singer's re-po man seizures (after all, it's ultimately the aid money we give Africa). In the UK, and in much of Europe, Singer is a finance outlaw. But in the USA, he's a âjob creator.â

Look, I've only scratched the surface from BBC's four-year investigation of Singer who says he'll talk with us, âNever, ever.â",am
109,"NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to overturn the fraud conviction of former Cendant Corp Chairman Walter Forbes for his role in one of corporate Americaâs largest accounting scandals.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected Forbesâ argument that a new trial was warranted because newly discovered evidence from a former chief financial officer at CUC International Inc, a Cendant predecessor, might exonerate him.

Forbesâ earlier appeal of his October 2006 conviction was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2008. The federal case had been prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Chris Christie of New Jersey, now that stateâs governor.

Masha Hansford, a lawyer for Forbes, declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Forbes, 72, was sentenced in January 2007 to 12 years, seven months in prison and ordered to pay $3.275 billion after jurors in Bridgeport, Connecticut, found him guilty of conspiracy and two counts of submitting false reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Prosecutors accused the New Canaan, Connecticut, resident of masterminding a fraud that began at CUC, where he had been chairman and chief executive officer, and inflated earnings.

The fraud was discovered in 1998, wiping out $14 billion of market value in one day at Cendant, a travel and real estate services company. Its size was later surpassed by scandals at Enron Corp and WorldCom Inc.

In his latest appeal, Forbes sought to have former CUC Chief Financial Officer Stuart Bell rebut testimony from Cosmo Corigliano, his successor as CFO, about the fraud.

Bell had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but Forbes said he could now testify under immunity because the statute of limitations for the government to charge him had run out.

Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, however, wrote for a three-judge panel that the time lapse did not make Bellâs testimony newly discovered, given that Forbes âhad to be awareâ of its exculpatory nature during the trial.

The âmere passage of timeâ did not justify a new trial, Wesley wrote.

Cendant evolved into what is now Avis Budget Group Inc and in 2000 reached a $2.9 billion civil class action settlement with shareholders.

Forbes is not eligible for release until July 21, 2018.

Mr. McAfee, 75, is a Silicon Valley legend who earned millions from the computer virus-fighting software company that still bears his surname. In 2012, he disappeared from his home in Belize after the local police sought him for questioning over the death of his neighbor.

He resurfaced in Guatemala City a few weeks later, then largely dropped out of the public eye for years â until 2016, when he tried to run as a Libertarian candidate for president of the United States.

The Justice Department said on Monday that Mr. McAfeeâs extradition from Spain to the United States was âpending.â It did not provide a timeline, and Mr. McAfee could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.",am
111,"A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Lithuanian national Vytautas Parfionovas with computer intrusion, securities fraud, money laundering, bank fraud and wire fraud, among other offenses. The charged crimes stem from a variety of criminal conduct between 2011 and 2018 in which Parfionovas gained access to U.S.-based computers, including email servers and computers belonging to U.S. financial institutions, in order to steal money from online bank accounts and securities brokerage accounts. Parfinovas was arrested in Ukraine on October 24, 2019, and was extradited to the United States on November 21, 2019.

Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the charges.

âAs alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators stole millions of dollars from U.S. victims while sitting behind keyboards thousands of miles away,â stated United States Attorney Donoghue. âCybercriminals are hereby on notice that no amount of distance or subterfuge will protect them, and that we and our law enforcement partners are committed to unmasking, arresting and prosecuting them.â Mr. Donoghue thanked the Prosecutor Generals Office of Ukraine, the FBI Legal AttachÃ©âs Office in Kiev, the Department of Justiceâs Office of International Affairs and the National Cyber Forensic Training Alliance for their assistance in the investigation and the defendantâs extradition.

âThe world has become a much smaller place with the advent of the internet, and with that shrinking globe, the days of cyber criminals thinking because they're not in our country they can escape justice are over,â stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. âOur extraordinary partnerships allow the FBI to reach into many of the dark corners where these thieves feel invincible. If you violate our laws, we will make sure you pay the price.â

As charged in the criminal complaint, starting in January 2011, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators engaged in a long-running scheme to steal money through a variety of computer intrusions.

In one part of the scheme, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained login information for victimsâ securities brokerage accounts through various methods, including stealing that information from the server of a U.S. securities order management company to which the conspirators gained unauthorized access. The conspirators then used those accounts to steal money and conduct trades to their own benefit. Initially, conspirators accessed the victim brokerage accounts and transferred money from those accounts to other accounts under their control. After financial institutions began to block those unauthorized transfers, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators accessed other victim brokerage accounts without authorization, and placed unauthorized stock trades within those accounts while simultaneously trading profitably in the same stocks from accounts that they controlled. On or about February 22, 2016, Parfionovas explained this aspect of the scheme to a co-conspirator as follows: âI take some fraud logins. Do some s[_]t with stock . . . sometimes 2-3 in day . . . manipulation is 100%.â In this manner, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators realized financial gains while causing losses of more than $5.5 million.

In another part of the scheme, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained login information for victim email accounts and accessed those accounts without authorization. The conspirators then sent email messages from those accounts to the victimsâ financial advisers and requested wire transfers from the victimsâ financial institutions to overseas bank accounts that the conspirators controlled. For example, in or about May 2013, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators obtained $50,000 from an investment account that belonged to U.S. victims, and Parfionovas directed the transfer of those funds to a series of bank accounts and ultimately to an individual in Kharkov, Ukraine, where Parfionovas was located. To defraud another victim, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators obtained control over a victimâs email account and used it to send written instructionsâwhich falsely appeared to have been signed by the victimâto transfer $225,000 from one of the victimâs accounts.

If convicted, the defendant faces up to 30 yearsâ imprisonment for the money laundering charge, and a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence for the charge of aggravated identity theft.

The charges in the complaint announced today are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The governmentâs case is being handled by the Officeâs National Security and Cybercrime Section and the Business and Securities Fraud Section. Assistant United States Attorneys David K. Kessler, Mark E. Bini and Alexander Mindlin are in charge of the prosecution. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the Departmentâs Criminal Division provided significant assistance in securing the defendantâs extradition from Ukraine.

112,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated drug launderer Pedro Claver Mejia Salazar (Mejia Salazar) and his narcotics money laundering network based in MedellÃ­n, Colombia pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Treasury also designated Colombian national Fredy Alonso Mira Perez (alias Fredy Colas), an important underboss in the criminal organization known as La Oficina de Envigado, as well as 10 additional individuals, and 14 entities, all based in Colombia. As a result of todayâs actions, all assets that are based in the United States or in control by U.S. persons in which the individuals and entities designated today have an interest in are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

Mejia Salazar, often acting under the authority and direction of Fredy Colas, primarily launders narcotics proceeds on behalf of La Oficina de Envigado, a group which Treasury designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act on June 26, 2014. As part of his global drug money laundering operations, Mejia Salazar and his network work closely with Lebanese-Colombian drug money launderer Ayman Saied Joumaa, also a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.

âOperatives of La Oficina de Envigado have tapped into Ayman Joumaaâs international networks and successfully moved drug proceeds back to traffickers in Colombia from locations around the world, posing a major threat to U.S. interests,â said Director of Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam Szubin. âTreasury will continue to aggressively expose and disrupt the activities of these illicit networks, wherever they may be operating.â

Mejia Salazar relies on a network of trusted family members to carry out his money laundering transactions, including his sons â Juan Carlos, Victor Gabriel, Andres Camilo, and Jose Alejandro Mejia Alzate â and his nephews â Jesus Rodolfo, Jose Albeiro, and Jose Guillermo Barco Mejia. Several entities designated today, which are owned by Mejia Salazar and his family, are also directly involved in these illicit transactions, including Grupo Empresarial Enkor Profesional S.A.S., a well-known beauty products company based in MedellÃ­n.

Todayâs action was made possible by a lengthy investigation led by the Financial Investigations Team of the Drug Enforcement Administrationâs (DEA) New England Field Division.

âThe success of this investigation was a direct result of the hard work and dedication of the DEA New England Field Divisionâs Financial Investigation Team and our law enforcement partners,â said DEA Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson. âThe DEA New England Field Division is committed to targeting large-scale criminal organizations, using all our enforcement resources.â

Since June 2000, more than 1,600 individuals and entities have been named pursuant to the Kingpin Act for their role in international narcotics trafficking. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.",am
113,"HSBCâs Swiss private banking arm has agreed to pay nearly $336m to settle a tax fraud case in Belgium, prosecutors said on Tuesday, in the latest blow dealt by the European Union to the Alpine stateâs banking sector.

HSBC, Europeâs largest bank, was âcharged by a prosecutor in 2014 for serious and organised tax fraud, forgery and falsification of records, money-laundering and illegal use of financial intermediariesâ, said prosecutors.

They alleged that HSBC helped and encouraged the avoidance of the EU savings tax by creating offshore companies in Panama and other tax havens in the Caribbean for wealthy Belgian clients âwith no other purpose but to hide moneyâ.

A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. But it has already not been a good week for the bank, which announced 4,000 job losses and parted ways with CEO John Flint on Monday.

Overhaul

The bank has now made and committed to a significant overhaul of its practices to counter financial crime risks following the Belgian allegations, prosecutors said.

European governments have stepped up their pressure on banks and tax havens in recent years after a string of media revelations â including of the disclosure of the Panama Papers, exposed tax avoidance and evasion schemes that helped the wealthy to avoid paying taxes in the bloc.

The Belgian prosecutors said that under the settlement, which still needs to be endorsed by Belgian judges, HSBC agreed to pay $330m to the Belgian state for losses in tax revenues caused by the alleged illegal activities carried out by the bank since 2013.

The prosecutors estimated that money transferred to these financial vehicles could amount to several billions of dollars.

More than a thousand Belgian taxpayers could have used HSBCâs illegal schemes, which mostly served clients active in the Antwerp diamond business, prosecutors said.

In addition to the tax fraud, the prosecutorsâ statement said part of the illegal transfers could have involved money laundering.

The settlement comes after a French court in February ordered UBS, another Swiss lender, to pay $5bn in penalties for illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. UBS, which is under investigation in Belgium for a similar case, denies the charges.

Swiss banks have been exposed to such legal challenges since 2004, when Bern agreed to apply an EU tax on the savings income of its lendersâ EU clients.",am
114,"The U.S. Secret Service have arrested five individuals and seized multiple bank accounts related to a $6 billion money laundering scheme being described by authorities as âstaggeringâ and the largest ever case of international money-laundering.

In a statement, Secret Service officials said authorities in Spain, Costa Rica and New York arrested five people on Friday and seized bank accounts and Internet domains associated with the company Liberty Reserve â a Costa Rica-based website that deals in digital currency and allows transnational online payments and money transfers.

Digital currency is a form of online currency made up of transferable units that can be exchanged with cash, and has exploded in popularity in the last decade with the increasing use of Bitcoin, the most widely used form of digital currency. Liberty Reserveâs currency was not connected with Bitcoin.

Charging a low one percent fee on transactions, Liberty Reserve allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including ""Russian Hacker"" and ""Hacker Account,"" and to redeem the currency for cash in any part of the world using the third-party exchange companies.

Aditya Sood, a computer science doctoral candidate at Michigan State University who has studied the underground economy, described Liberty Reserve as a no-questions-asked alternative to the global banking system, with little more than a valid email needed to open an account and start moving money across borders.

""You don't need to provide your full details, or personal information, or things like that,"" Sood said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press. ""There's no way to trace an account. That's the beauty of the system.""

Arthur Budovsky, the founder of Liberty Reserve, was one of the individuals arrested, while a defendant identified as Budovskyâs partner, Vladimir Kats, was in custody in New York.

According to the statement from the Secret Service, Liberty Reserve had approximately one million users worldwide with more than 200,000 users in the United States. Overall, the company processed an estimated 55 million separate financial transactions and is believed to have laundered more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds.

""The scope of the defendants' unlawful conduct is staggering,"" said an indictment unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.

The indictment described the network as ""one of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world distribute, store and launder proceeds of their illegal activity ... including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking.""

âThe U.S. Secret Service, in coordination with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Global Illicit Financial Team (GIFT) hosted by IRS-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) executed and arrested search warrants in seven countries that also include Spain and the Netherlands. Assets of Liberty Reserve will also be frozen in Hong Kong, Spain, Morocco and China,â the Secret Service statement said.

According to the press release, current and former executives of Liberty Reserve have also been charged with violating numerous anti money laundering statutes and operating as illegal money transmitters.

Budovsky and Katz have previous convictions on charges related to an unlicensed money-transmitting business, according to court papers. After that case, the pair decided to move their operation to Costa Rica, where Budovsky officially renounced his U.S. citizenship, the papers say.

In an online chat captured by law enforcement, Katz admitted Liberty Reserve was ""illegal"" and noted that authorities in the United States knew it was ""a money laundering operation that hackers use.""

Mitchell Rossetti, whose Houston, Texas-based ePayCards.com was one of several mainstream merchants that accepted the online-only currency, said his business still had about $28,000 tied up in Liberty Reserve accounts.

""The irony of this is I went to them because of the security,"" Rossetti said. ""All sales were final.""",am
115,"Zambiaâs anti-corruption agency on Tuesday arrested a medical practitioner for issuing COVID-19 clearance certificates suspected to be fake .

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) said Kingsley Kakoma, a biomedical technologist at the Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital, was arrested for suspected corrupt practices in relation to the illegal issuance of travellersâ medical certification for COVID-19.

Timothy Moono, the anti-corruption agencyâs Corporate Affairs Manager said the medical officer was arrested after a tip-off from members of the public and was found in possession of 2,250 Zambian Kwacha (about 110 U.S. dollars) and five blank COVID-19 clearance medical certificates.

He said in a statement that the certificates were pre-signed, marked negative and bore a stamp for the Zambia Institute of Public Health, the government agency authorized to issue COVID-19 certificates.

He was also found in possession of 86 preservation solution tubes, 50 sample collection swabs, among other items.

The suspect, he said, was arrested after soliciting for money from a student who was scheduled to travel abroad for studies.

The Ministry of Health warned recently that it was aware of some private health facilities that were issuing fake COVID-19 certificates at a fee.

Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya said the trend poses risks to the health of people and warned of stern action to anyone who will be arrested.

Zambia has so far recorded 15,549 COVID-19 cases since March, including 14,682 recoveries and 345 deaths.",am
116,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. â A Prairie Village, Kansas, man pleaded guilty in federal court today to engaging in two separate fraud schemes related to millions of dollars in false payday loan debt and to tax evasion totaling more than $8 million.

âThis well-dressed thief victimized millions of Americans whose personal information was fraudulently sold to debt collectors,â Garrison said. âSome of those victims, in their fear and confusion, actually paid debts they didnât owe. And by hiding his income and assets then lying about it to federal agents, he victimized every honest citizen who obeys the law and pays their income taxes. His thievery allowed him to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle for a short time, but he wonât be entitled to such luxuries in federal prison.â

âToday, Mr. Tucker admitted he evaded the payment of taxes assessed against him. Despite receiving millions of dollars, Mr. Tucker used such funds to sustain a lavish lifestyle and not fulfill his civic duty,â said Adam Steiner, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the St. Louis Field Office. âWe are determined at the IRS and Department of Justice to halt tax evasion, and the facts outlined in todayâs plea are strong indicators that we can and will find this fraudulent activity.â

Joel Jerome Tucker, 51, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Roseann Ketchmark to one count of transporting stolen money across state lines, one count of bankruptcy fraud, and one count of tax evasion.

Tucker, working through various companies, serviced payday loan businesses. Tuckerâs company names changed over the years; the primary company was eData Solutions, LLC. eData, formally registered on July 29, 2009, did not make loans directly to borrowers; it collected loan application information, referred to as leads, and sold those leads to its approximately 70 payday lender clients. As a loan servicer, eData also provided software for payday lenders.

Tucker and the other owners of eData sold the company to the Wyandotte Indian tribe in 2012. However, despite selling his interest in eData, Tucker maintained a file of 7.8 million leads he had acquired through eData, containing detailed customer information (including names, addresses, bank accounts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, etc.). eData had collected the detailed customer information from online payday loan applications or inquiries to its payday lender clients; the file did not represent loans that were made. In addition, Tucker obtained and retained data regarding defaulted payday loans eData had acquired from a number of different payday lender clients. Tucker used these files to create falsified debt portfolios.

By pleading guilty today, Tucker admitted that he engaged in a fraudulent debt scheme from 2014 to 2016. This scheme involved marketing, distributing, and selling false debt portfolios. Tucker defrauded third party debt collectors and millions of individuals listed as debtors through the sale of falsified debt portfolios. Tucker sold supposed debts which: 1) he didnât personally own; 2) were not true debts; 3) had already been sold to other buyers; and 4) contained false lenders, false loan dates, false loan amounts, and false payment status. Tucker received as much as $7.3 million from the sale of false debt portfolios.

As part of his fraud scheme, Tucker transferred the proceeds of the fraud scheme across state lines.

Tucker also admitted that he executed a related bankruptcy fraud scheme in 2015. In his bankruptcy fraud scheme, Tucker also sold fraudulent debt, which entered the United States Bankruptcy Courts nationwide. When the United States Bankruptcy Court investigated these purported debts which were presented as claims in bankruptcy cases, Tucker provided false information and testimony to the Bankruptcy Court in order to conceal his scheme.

For tax years 2014 - 2016, neither Tucker personally nor any of his companies filed federal tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Tucker told IRS agents that he had no income and was living on borrowed money, including a lot of borrowed money from his mother. In reality, Tucker used nominee bank accounts to conceal income and assets and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal living expenses such as vehicles, chartered jets, travel and entertainment, and a personal residence. Tucker also submitted a form to the IRS in which he omitted listing as an asset his membership in the Vail Mountain Club, for which he received $275,000 in 2016.

Under the terms of todayâs plea agreement, Tucker must pay $8,057,079.95 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. Tucker also must forfeit to the government $5,000, which is the amount of stolen proceeds transferred across state lines as referenced in the specific count to which he pleaded guilty.

Under federal statutes, Tucker is subject to a sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.

This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kathleen D. Mahoney and Patrick D. Daly. It was investigated by the FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee in the Southern District of Texas.",am
117,"A fraudster who created a Â£10m property empire with the help of Tameside's criminal underworld has to pay back more than Â£3.5m or face more jail time.

Scott Rowbotham, 37, amassed a huge portfolio across Greater Manchester totalling 88 properties, with the assistance of criminals including convicted drug dealer Billy Black.

Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, Rowbotham has been ordered to pay back Â£3,522,459 within three months, or face 10 years in jail. The time period can be extended to six months if allowed.

That figure is the highest ever awarded by a court following a GMP financial investigation.

Rowbotham's property empire will now be sold off to recoup some of his ill-gotten gains.

It comes as solicitor Ross McKay, who helped Rowbotham achieve the huge fraud, was jailed for seven years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of three counts of money laundering.

Rowbotham, previously of Ashes Close, Stalybridge, was jailed for three years and eight months in May 2017 after admitting fraud and money laundering between 2004 and 2014.

He has now been released from prison.

Manchester Crown Court has heard that Rowbotham was able to persuade lenders to hand over huge cash sums by lying about his income and forging payslips.

He also exaggerated the value of houses he was buying, which cut out the need for deposits and in turn maximised his profits.

To fund more deals, Rowbotham let out and remortgaged existing properties, and falsified sales to friends and family to raise more cash.

He is said to have enjoyed a luxury lifestyle from the proceeds, despite earning only Â£1,000 in declared income and paying Â£18.20 in tax in an eleven-year period.

A sentencing hearing on Friday, prosecutor Nick Clarke QC said that McKay was Rowbotham's solicitor, carrying out conveyancing for their properties.

Police said McKay, a 39-year-old father-of-three, was their 'go to' lawyer, as he would not ask too many questions about their business or where the money was coming from.

Defending, Mark Rhind said that this marks the end of McKay's professional career, as he will be struck off.

McKay, originally from Dukinfield, studied law at Huddersfield University and qualified in 2004, the court heard.

Judge Timothy Smith said that McKay, of Sagars Road, Handforth, Cheshire, then acted fraudulently for a five year period, eventually being arrested in 2014.

Addressing him, the judge said: ""You were expected to be a person of utmost integrity and honesty.

""You fell far short of those high standards of professionalism, trust and integrity that are to be expected of a solicitor.

""You failed, as was your duty, to uphold the law and the proper administration of justice.

""By your actions, you enabled criminal property to be acquired on a significant scale, and chose to involve yourself in the activities of those involved in crime, organised crime and, in the case of Mr Black, drug dealing.""

After today's hearing, senior financial investigator Adrian Ladkin, of GMPâs Economic Crime Unit, said: ""McKay was fully aware that the purpose of the transactions was to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

""As a solicitor, McKay was in a position of trust, but he spectacularly failed in his legal duties through his corrupt and unlawful actions.

""It is thanks to the meticulous work of the officers in this case that today he has been brought to account for his deceitful actions.""

Black, now 48, was eventually jailed for 15 years after being was found guilty of fraud, drugs and money laundering offences.

He later had his sentence increased by seven years to a total of 22 years, after failing to pay off the Â£999,999 ordered following his Proceeds of Crime Act hearing.

Neil Bolton, a solicitor who fraudulently helped Black to build up his property portfolio, was also previously jailed for nine months.

The Proceeds of Crime Act, which came into force in 2013, allows police to go after the assets of criminals after they have been convicted.

118,"HARARE - Former Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo, who was among those detained by the military when they seized power before Robert Mugabe resigned, was charged with three counts of corruption in offences that took place more than a decade ago.

This was Chomboâs first public appearance since he was detained almost two weeks ago after the military launched âOperation Restore Legacyâ which it said was meant to remove âcriminalsâ around ousted president Mugabe.

Several members of a group allied to Mugabe and his wife Grace were detained and expelled from the ruling party, including Chombo, the ousted head of the influential Zanu-PF youth league Kudzanai Chipanga and a deposed leader in the partyâs youth wing Innocent Hamandishe.

Some supporters of new President Emmerson Mnangagwa have been calling for unspecified action against the so-called G40 group that backed Mugabe and his wife. Chombo, Chipanga and Hamandishe were allied to the G40 group.

Before his inauguration, Mnangagwa on Thursday urged the countryâs citizens not to undertake any form of âvengeful retributionâ.

Chombo was charged with attempting to defraud the Zimbabwean central bank, among other offenses committed in 2004, the state prosecutor said.

Chombo was local government minister at the time.

He was not asked to enter a plea at this first court appearance and the state asked the court to remand him in custody of until his trial on 8 December. Chombo showed no emotion while the charges were read out.

Chomboâs lawyer, Lovemore Madhuku said on Friday Chombo was admitted to hospital with injuries sustained from beatings he received in military custody. Chombo had no visible injuries and appeared calm, chatting with the police guarding him when the court took a break. He was dressed in dark blue suit.

The police have said they had no information on Chombo when asked to comment.

A former University lecturer and Mugabeâs ally, Chombo was promoted in an October cabinet reshuffle from the interior ministry to the finance portfolio, against the backdrop of a severe hard currency shortage that has dealt a fresh blow to the southern African economy, which uses the US dollar.

Chipanga appeared at the court to face charges of making statements aimed at undermining public confidence in the defence forces. Hamandishe faced six counts of kidnapping and one of publishing falsehoods and was detained in custody until 8 December.

Mugabeâs fall after 37 years in power was triggered by a battle to succeed him that pitted Mnangagwa against Mugabeâs much younger wife Grace, who is 52.

Mnangagwa, 75, the former vice president sacked by Mugabe earlier this month, was sworn in as president on Friday after the 93-year-old former president who had led Zimbabwe from independence in 1980, stepped down on Tuesday after the army seized power and the ruling party turned against him.",am
119,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2003-69

-- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic. The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Stewart committed illegal insider trading when she sold stock in a biopharmaceutical company, ImClone Systems, Inc., on Dec. 27, 2001, after receiving an unlawful tip from Bacanovic, at the time a broker with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. The Commission further alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic subsequently created an alibi for Stewart's ImClone sales and concealed important facts during SEC and criminal investigations into her trades. In a separate action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has obtained an indictment charging Stewart and Bacanovic criminally for their false statements concerning Stewart's ImClone trades.

The Commission seeks, among other relief, an order requiring Stewart and Bacanovic to disgorge the losses Stewart avoided through her unlawful trades, plus civil monetary penalties. The Commission also seeks an order barring Stewart from acting as a director of, and limiting her activities as an officer of, any public company. Stewart has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc.

Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, said: ""It is fundamentally unfair for someone to have an edge on the market just because she has a stockbroker who is willing to break the rules and give her an illegal tip. It's worse still when the individual engaging in the insider trading is the Chairman and CEO of a public company.""

Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""The Commission simply cannot allow corporate executives or industry professionals to profit illegally from their access to nonpublic information. The coordinated action announced today by the U.S. Attorney's Office shows that the consequences for those individuals will be even greater if we uncover evidence that they obstructed our investigation.""

Stewart's Dec. 27, 2001, ImClone sales came as ImClone and the market anxiously awaited an imminent decision from the Food and Drug Administration on one of ImClone's key products, a cancer treatment called ""Erbitux."" Bacanovic's unlawful inside tip was that other Bacanovic clients â ImClone's CEO, Samuel Waksal, and Waksal's daughter â had just placed orders to sell all the ImClone stock they held at Merrill Lynch. At the time, Waksal secretly knew that the FDA was about to reject ImClone's Erbitux application. Information about the Waksals' efforts to sell was confidential under Merrill Lynch policies, which prohibited employees from disclosing client transactions or effecting client trades on the basis of other client transactions. Had information about the Waksals' efforts to sell been known publicly, it would have signaled insider pessimism at ImClone about the FDA decision, the prospects for Erbitux, and the future of the company, according to the complaint.

The Commission alleges that, during the morning of Dec. 27, 2001, Bacanovic instructed his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, to tell Stewart that Waksal and his daughter were selling all the ImClone stock held in their Merrill Lynch accounts. During a subsequent telephone call, Faneuil conveyed that information to Stewart, who promptly instructed Faneuil to sell all 3,928 shares of her ImClone stock. The next day, Dec. 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA had decided not to accept ImClone's Erbitux application for filing. By the close of the next trading day, Monday, Dec. 31, 2001, the price of ImClone stock dropped 16% to $46 per share. By selling when she did, Stewart avoided losses of $45,673.

The Commission alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic went on to lie when the Commission staff and criminal authorities questioned them about the facts surrounding Stewart's sale of ImClone stock. Stewart and Bacanovic fabricated an alibi for Stewart's trades, stating that she sold her ImClone stock because she and Bacanovic had decided earlier that she would sell if ImClone's stock price fell below $60 per share. In addition, Stewart told the government that she did not recall anyone telling her that day that any of the Waksals were selling their ImClone stock.

Pursuant to a separate Commission order issued this morning, the Commission has barred Faneuil from association with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter.

120,"The federal agency tasked with distributing funds obtained via the sale of assets seized from organized crime and tax cheats is plagued by corruption, according to its outgoing chief.

In his resignation letter to President LÃ³pez Obrador, Jaime CÃ¡rdenas of the Institute to Return Stolen Goods to the People (Indep) said that when he took over as director a range of âprobable administrative irregularitiesâ were detected.

CÃ¡rdenas, who has led Indep for about 100 days and will step down on September 30, said officials stole jewelry in the agencyâs possession and manipulated the auctions it held.

Indep, an agency created by the LÃ³pez Obrador administration and one that has been held up as a beacon of honesty, has held several auctions to sell off assets the government has seized from organized crime. Assets that have been sold include jewelry, luxury vehicles and properties.

CÃ¡rdenas also said that officials were found to have engaged in other improper conduct including the âmutilation of jewelryâ and the drawing up of contracts that were unduly favorable to companies with which Indep had dealings.

With regard to the theft of jewelry, the Indep chief said that criminal complaints have been filed with the Attorney Generalâs Office (FGR).

He said that Indep legal officials are analyzing the possibility of filing complaints against those who allegedly manipulated auctions âin favor of a few people.â

The outgoing director also said that a review of Indepâs IT systems with the aim of âeradicating manipulationâ in future online auctions has been completed.

CÃ¡rdenas, also an academic at the National Autonomous Universityâs Institute of Legal Research and a longtime supporter of LÃ³pez Obrador, said that 2 billion pesos transferred to Indep to pay the prizes in the âpresidential planeâ raffle has not yet been reconciled.

âThese resources are invested, they generate interest but they havenât been used,â he said without clarifying when the money will be withdrawn to pay prizes to the winners of the raffle, which was drawn last week.

On a positive note, CÃ¡rdenas outlined Indepâs achievements since he became its director.

Among them: transferring millions of pesos to two indigenous municipalities in Oaxaca and Guerrero; providing financial support to the government-affiliated, non-profit publishing group Fondo de Cultura EcÃ³nomica; providing funds to the Ministry of Culture to purchase musical instruments for childrenâs bands in Oaxaca; and allocating almost 180 million pesos to Insabi, the agency tasked with managing the governmentâs universal healthcare scheme.

CÃ¡rdenas also said that Indep under his leadership approved the transfer of more than 200 million pesos to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation for the construction of highways and that a further 500 million pesos will go to Insabi when the funds are available.

All told Indep approved the transfer of more than 3.7 billion pesos (US $167.4 million) to indigenous communities, the health system, cultural institutions, athletes and infrastructure projects.

CÃ¡rdenas wrote that Indep has a âsignificant but not endlessâ chest of resources as well as âserious challenges,â noting that it has debts to suppliers and lacks the liquidity it requires to pay settlements to former government railway and electricity workers.

Despite the corruption at Indep and the other problems it faces, the outgoing director said that he was leaving the federal government with a heavy heart.

âI deeply regret not accompanying â¦ the project of transformation you are leading,â CÃ¡rdenas wrote in the opening to his resignation letter to the president. âI always wish the best for you and the country,â his letter concluded.

CÃ¡rdenas, who has previously served as a lawmaker in Mexico City and a lawyer and legal adviser for LÃ³pez Obrador when he was a presidential candidate, will be replaced as Indep chief by Ernesto Prieto, the former director of the National Lottery.",am

A businessman involved in a âhighly sophisticatedâ boiler room scam has been jailed for seven years today.

Muhammad Tanveer, of South Street, Romford was one of four men jailed for money laundering offences at Southwark Crown Court on Friday, April 26.

Tanveer, 30, was part of a group of eight who ran an elaborate scam from 2014 until 2016, conning more than 50 people out of Â£1.6million by convincing them to invest in fake companies.

In particular they would target elderly and often vulnerable individuals, with some people being scammed by the group more than once.

Judge Joanna Korner told the court: âThe reason this fraud was particularly unpleasant was that part of it was aimed at many people who had already been defrauded.

âThe frauds were highly sophisticated.â

A boiler room fraud sees criminals make cold calls or emails to people pretending to be from an established and legitimate company, persuading them to invest in what are in fact completely worthless or non-existent stocks. Often high pressured sales tactics are used, which is why they're described as boiler room.

The scam saw more than 50 people lose out to the con, with one victim, aged 83, losing just over Â£1m.

Another victim, who lost around Â£300,000, said in an impact statement to the police: âThe financial loss has had a significant impact on my family and a longer term impact on not being able to provide for my family and children.â

Another told the police he couldn't sleep and had lost weight because of all the stress.

Judge Korner identified Tanveer as playing a leading role in the scam. He helped set up the companies used for the fraud, made arrangements for the websites and logos, and had direct contact with some of the investors.

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington was jailed for four years on Friday, April 26 for his part in a boiler room scam which conned elderly people out of Â£3million. Picture: ERSOU

âDuring the course of the evidence, [Tanveer] told lie after lie,â said judge Korner.

âSome of which were particularly outrageous. Even after being convicted in the first trial he declined to plead guilty.â

In addition to being jailed for a maximum of seven years, Tanveer was disqualified from acting as a director of a company for 10 years.

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington, not only played a pivotal role in the scam but âheavily influencedâ his cousin Lucy Richardson, 25, and his mother, Mandy Cross, 30, both also from Orpington, into setting up the fraudulent accounts.

He was jailed for four years and eight months and disqualified from acting as the director of a company for seven years.

Richardson was given a suspended sentence of two years for a two year period and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and Mandy Cross, who used some of the money she gained from the scam to holiday in Mexico, was given a suspended sentence of 12 months for two years and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk, also played a key role in the scam. He had just been freed from prison for previous fraud convictions when he met Tanveer.

The court found that he was at high risk of reoffending and he was jailed for six years.

Ryan Weston, 27, from Wisbech, was jailed for a total of three years and six months after pleading guilty to money laundering at a trial on Monday, April 8.

Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk, pleaded guilty to money laundering at an earlier court date and was given a 20 months suspended sentence for two years, ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from being a director of a company for five years.

Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay, was given a 15 months suspended sentence for two years and disqualified from acting as a director of a company for five years.

Judge Korner said: âThese types of boiler room fraud are both pervasive, pernicious and mean and they produce large rewards for those who commit them.

âNo one who reads or watches the media can fail to be aware that, notwithstanding the organisations set up by the police, only a tiny proportion of fraud receives investigations.

âI have no doubt that police resources are struggling. It's imperative that more time and resources are devoted not just to cyber crime but also these type of fraud of cases.â

Alistair Dickson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: âThis was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didn't exist.

âCommon to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable.

âPersuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told.

âThe reality is that the gang conned their way to nearly Â£3m.â",am

123,"It is clear that Danske Bank has failed to live up to its responsibility in the case of possible money laundering in Estonia.

So said Thomas Borgen, CEO of Denmarkâs biggest financial institution, when he resigned after admitting that around â¬200 billion of questionable money flowed through the Danish bankâs Estonian branch from 2007-15.

To put that figure into some perspective, the GDP of Estonia in 2017 was â¬29 billion and the figure in question is approaching two thirds of the GDP of Denmark itself at â¬324 billion.

It raises serious questions over the capacity of banks â and governments â to combat the serious scourge of money laundering. The European Commission has called the case the âbiggest scandal in Europeâ and Danske Bank and Denmark and Estoniaâs financial watchdogs face an inquiry from the European Unionâs banking supervisor to see whether they broke the law.

Money laundering facilitates crime, undermines financial systems and ultimately can seriously damage economies. This is all well recognised â and yet it seems that even the worldâs most sophisticated financial regimes cannot control the flow of suspect money through the system.

To get some perspective on the scale of the problem, the National Crime Agency estimates that the cost of money laundering to the UK economy is Â£24 billion a year. Globally, it is estimated that up to 5 per cent of global GDP â thatâs Â£1.5 trillion â is laundered by criminals each year.

Money laundering is the process by which âdirty moneyâ â which is to say money that is identifiable as the proceeds of crime â is made to look legitimate by passing it through financial systems to disguise its suspicious origins.

Various techniques are used, generally involving layers of transactions. This may involve moving money through different countries and then returning it in a way that looks legitimate. It may involve spurious transactions at inflated values such as paying a high price for a shell company, the purchase and resale of property or legitimate businesses.

Even fake litigation has been used to disguise the ultimate source of funds â a cash intensive business is set up, documents are created to suggest a legitimate debt and then a solicitor is approached to recover it. When the fake debtor makes a payment, the funds are passed through the solicitorâs bank account and back to the client.

The Danske case

In recognition of the extent of the problem, the G7 group of major economies formed the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering back in 1989. The idea behind this was to produce a set of standards and guidelines and to monitor progress on anti-money laundering regimes.

The focus is to identify suspicious transactions and report them. For anti-money laundering efforts to be successful, it requires financial institutions to know their customers. This means that banks must be able to identify the ultimate beneficial recipient of a transaction â so the person who takes the profit â of any customer on their books.

This is where Danske Bank ran into trouble. Its Estonian branch came about when Danske acquired Sampo Bank, a small Finnish Bank in 2007. Sampo had a non-resident portfolio in Estonia and it is this that caused the problems.

In the words of the independent report into the scandal, which preempted CEO Borgenâs resignation: âAnti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch had been manifestly insufficient and inadequate.â Danske Bank has also admitted there were âmajor deficiencies in controls and governance that made it possible to use Danske Bankâs branch in Estonia for criminal activities such as money launderingâ.

Danske shut down the non-resident portfolio in 2015 after it became clear that the bankâs anti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch werenât working. As a mere branch, Estonia should have been subject to Danskeâs own money laundering systems â but the branch had its own IT platform, which meant it was not covered by the same risk monitoring as the bankâs Copenhagen headquarters.

The independent investigation found that more than half of Danskeâs 15,000 customers in Estonia were suspicious. The source of funds passing through the portfolio was identified as more than 58 per cent coming from Russia, Estonia and Latvia. The destinations of the funds were worldwide.

The difficulty in identifying the true source of the funds comes from the lack of transparency as to the real owners of the customers in the portfolio. A proportion of them are UK-based companies that are registered as limited liability partnerships â this means they are not required to publish details of their eventual owners. This is a classic case of money laundering where ownership often passes through a series of shell companies before the eventual owner can be identified.

The customers are being investigated by several national authorities including the FBI and the UK National Crime Agency. The Danish regulator is investigating Danske Bank itself. Harsh penalties for the bank could ensue â Denmarkâs business minister said the Danish authorities could fine Danske 4 billion Danish kroner (Â£475 million). But it remains to be seen what the long-term damage will be for Danske, if any.

A wider question surrounds the failure of international anti-money laundering regimes. To date there have been no examples of significant criminal sanctions for failure to implement an effective anti-money laundering process within a business. Nor is there any rigorous external scrutiny of how guidelines are implemented. But it is high time there was â while there is still a financial system to protect.",am
124,"Thomas J. Barrack Jr. is an American private equity real eestate investorand the founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital Inc. Barrack is a close friend and ally of President Donald Trump and has represented Trump on television news segments.

Barack is so close to President Trump that he even comfored him on his fatherâs funeral as some reports claimed at the time.

But when it comes to his country and itâs citizens the President shows no mercy.

Trump has reportedly cut off Tom Barrack over the inaugural fund investigation.

Via Politico:

The key issue driving the two men apart: Barrackâs role as chairman of the presidentâs 2017 inauguration fund, which is under investigation by prosecutors.

Trump was âreally upsetâ to read reports about Barrackâs role in allegedly making it easy for some foreigners and others to try to spend money to get access to Trump and his inner circle and whether some of the inauguration money was misspent, according to a senior administration official.

âThe president was really surprised to read all about the inauguration and who was trying to buy access and how, because the president doesnât get any of that money,â said the official.

This is a really big deal. If the Presidentâs close friend abused his position then Trump is right to be upset and cut ties.

Barrack decided to answer to these allegations:

But a spokesman for Barrack, Owen Blicksilver, pushed back on the notion that the two are no longer friendly.

âThe relationship between Mr. Barrack and the president remains unchanged,â he said in a statement. âThey have been friends for 40 years and Tom has great respect for President Trump and the incredibly daunting task of executing the job of president of the United States. Just as the president has worked 24/7 to lead the strongest economy in the last 50 years, Mr. Barrack also has a 24/7 responsibility leading a business he created 26 years ago.â

Maybe Tom Barack is guilty after all, but after the last 2-year spending spree, I donât believe anything the press post about potential corruption. As far as I can tell the only corrupt entities are the Press, DNC, and the rest of the list of swamp creatures.

125,"SALT LAKE CITY â A federal judge has frozen the assets of a Utah rare coin dealer after the Utah Department of Commerce and others accused the business and its owner of defrauding at least 200 people of more than $170 million since 2013.

A federal complaint was filed Thursday in Utah by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Rust Rare Coin, Inc. and owner Gaylen Dean Rust.

The Utah Department of Commerce says the company and Rust have defrauded customers in Utah and 16 other states, including receiving ""at least $42 million from investors in a pool that purportedly bought and sold silver,"" according to a press release issued Friday by the Commerce Department in conjunction with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Division of Securities.

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell issued a restraining order freezing the assets of Rust Rare Coin and allowing state and federal officials to ""inspect all relevant records,"" according to the statement.

The company is accused of tricking investors since 2008 into believing it was ""pooling investor money for the purpose of entering into contracts of sale for silver. â¦ (Rust Rare Coin) told investors and prospective investors that they would sell silver held in the pool as market prices rose and buy silver for the pool as market prices fell; thereby increasing the amount of silver held in the 'Silver Pool,' as well as the value of each investorâs share in that pool,"" the statement said.

The Silver Pool, however, was a ""sham,"" according to the statement. Rust Rare Coin, however, ""generated extraordinarily high profits, averaging 20 to 25 percent per year and sometimes as high as 40 percent per year or more. The defendants provided investors with false account statements.""

âAs alleged, for at least a decade, the defendants defrauded their friends, customers, and business associates out of more than $170 million. The defendants allegedly concealed their fraud with false account statements and Ponzi payments,"" Director of Enforcement James McDonald said in a prepared statement.

Rust Rare Coin ""misappropriated investor funds and used these funds to make payments to other investors in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, transfer money to other companies owned by Rust, and pay personal expenses,"" according to the statement.",am

The CID Cybercrime Division of the Bengaluru City Police Thursday arrested four persons from Rajasthan who allegedly impersonated public figures, government officers, police officials on social media to transfer funds from friends and followers.

According to the police, the accused â identified as Ansar, Balvinder Singh, Saini, and Saddam â were arrested after the investigating team visited Bharatpur and other places in Rajasthan based on leads received during the probe.

In the past few months, the Cybercrime Division had registered at least four cases based on several incidents. âOver 10 such cases were filed in different police stations across Karnataka after which a team including K R Nagaraj (DSP, Cyber Crimes Division, CID), and Nayaz Ahmed (Police Inspector, CCD, CID) was formed to investigate the matter,â an officer from the Bengaluru Cybercrime Division told indianexpress.com.

Further, after collecting adequate evidence to record the arrests, the police explained the modus operandi saying that the accused were found to have collected photographs and other personal and professional information of genuine people to create fake social media profiles in their names.

âIn the guise of such profiles, they first send friend requests to people who are already there on the friendsâ list. Upon acceptance of friend request, they induce the persons to transfer money to various e-wallets and payment bank accounts citing some urgent need, thereby cheating them,â the officer explained.

The investigation also revealed that the accused worked as a team to apply for the activation of thousands of fake SIM cards using fake Aadhaar cards created by mixing up different photographs, addresses, and Aadhar numbers.

The probe team said the accused Saini created fake Aadhar cards which were handed over to Ansar, who worked as a retailer and uploaded them for SIM card activation. Balvinder worked as a SIM distributor who activated the same bypassing standard processes of verification, while Saddam used to receive all the money sent to the accounts created.

âIn addition to impersonating people on Facebook, the accused persons used such fake SIM cards to open accounts on Twitter and Instagram as well to advertise on online re-selling platforms (OLX, Quikr), to open e-wallets/payment bank accounts like PayTM, Airtel Money, Google Pay, PhonePe, etc. in order to commit various cyber and online financial crimes across the country,â the team added.

Another accused, identified as Shakeel, who created fake social media profiles is still absconding and the search for him is underway, the police added.

Further, the supervising team advised the public not to fall prey to such frauds and to exercise caution while accepting any request from government officers, especially from those who are already there in the friendsâ list. âPrivacy controls provided by the social media sites may be used to avoid any misuse of information,â it said.

129,"A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about Â£8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than Â£400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about Â£400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.",am
130,"Tampa, FL â U.S. District Judge James S. Moody, Jr. has sentenced Howayda Hamdan to seven years and six months in federal prison for engaging in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. As part of her sentence, the court also entered a money judgment in the amount of $1,168,858.11, the proceeds of the conspiracy. Hamdan pleaded guilty on August 21, 2014.

According to court documents, from January 2011 to April 20, 2011, while working as a personal banker for Regions Bank, Hamdan opened 292 bank accounts using 146 stolen identities. These accounts were opened for the sole purpose of laundering fraudulently obtained federal income tax refund checks that were acquired using the stolen identities of another 219 unknowing victims.

Hamdanâs co-conspirators, Riad Sulaiman, Nedal Ahmad, and Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja, owned and operated businesses where they knowingly negotiated fraudulently obtained tax refund checks. The co-conspirators brought the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks to Hamdan so they could be deposited and the proceeds withdrawn. Many of these checks were issued in the names of deceased individuals.

Hamdan needed means of identification, including names and Social Security numbers, to open the accounts at Regions Bank. Co-conspirator Dana Brown, a police officer, provided printouts from DAVID, Floridaâs driverâs license database. The printouts contained the personally identifiable information (PII) required to open the bogus bank accounts. Since the victims of the tax filing scheme were often deceased, lived outside Florida, and/or were unknown to Hamdan and her co-conspirators, the stolen identities used to open the bank accounts were different, although similar in name, than the stolen identities used by the tax filers to obtain the tax refunds.

Once Hamdan deposited the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks, she facilitated the distribution of the proceeds to her co-conspirators, including her husband, Hicham El Faoutih. In May 2011, agents searched Hamdanâs residence. Among other things, they recovered $81,460.00 in cash (still inside a Regions Bank bag and wrapped with bank wrappers); three fraudulently obtained Treasury checks; a ledger containing hundreds of names and Social Security numbers; and stolen identities that had been provided by Brown.

In total, Hamdan facilitated the deposit or receipt of $1,168,858.11 in fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The government has also identified more than 400 victims whose identities were stolen during the course of Hamdanâs activities.

The co-conspirators in this case were previously prosecuted and sentenced. In July 2014, Hicham El Faoutih was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. Nedal Ahmad was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison in June 2013. In June 2012, Ocala Police officer Dana Brown was sentenced to six years and five months in federal prison. In December 2011, Riad Sulaiman was sentenced in the Southern District of Florida to 41 months in federal prison. In August 2013, Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja was sentenced in the Western District of Virginia to 70 months in federal prison; this sentence is being served concurrent to a 37-month sentence imposed in April 2012 in the Middle District of Florida case.

This case was investigated by the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pasco County Sheriffâs Office. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Mandy Riedel.",am

132,"The multi-millionaire owner of the Nina Ricci fashion company was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC bank.

Arlette Ricci, 74 and one of the richest women in Europe, was âparticularly determinedâ to stash money in Swiss accounts for more than two decades.

A judgement handed down by a Paris criminal court added: âThe seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to the public good.â

Ricci had denied hiding the equivalent of more than Â£15million, saying she had simply tried to avoid tax â which is legal â rather than evade it, which is not.

However, bugged phone conversations between the heiress and her daughter, Margot Vignat, suggested otherwise. According to the transcript, Ms Ricci boasted that she changed banks to escape prosecution and spent the hidden funds on buying a chalet in an upmarket Swiss ski resort.

âI was never troubled. So I bought a chalet in Klosters, and now itâs fine. There was 2009, 2010, 2011 â itâs been three years so I think Iâm free of any type of inspection,â Ricci was heard to say.

Her daughter was heard warning her about the tax authorities, saying: 'Watch out all the same. They're vicious.'

But Ricci reassured her, saying: 'Everyone got done but not me. They had to give themselves in and pay a fortune.'

The daughter replied: 'Oh, that could cause some damage'. Ricci, in turn, said: 'Yes, of course, because all that is very illegal.'

In what will set a legal precedent for other cases of tax fraud through HSBC, Ricci was also fined the equivalent of more than Â£700,000.

Judges also ordered that houses in Paris and on the holiday island of Corsica worth more than Â£3m be seized.

Ricci was accused of transferring the deeds of the properties to family trusts in an attempt to restructure her assets, so as to evade penalties.

She was given a total of three years in prison, with two years suspended. Her daughter, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Henri-Nicolas Fleurance, Ricciâs tax adviser, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and an Â£8000 fine for attempting to organise her insolvency.

Jean-Marc Fedida, one of the defence barristers, said 'justice was done under frenetic, brutal pressure', so as to use a high-profile defendant as a 'warning to all those' with offshore accounts.

But he conceded the sentence was 'much lighter' that what the prosecution had asked for.

Ricci, who had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, may ask if she can serve the prison term under less strict conditions, including wearing an electronic tag, her lawyers said.

Her lawyers always argued the fault lay with HSBC in Switzerland, with one insisting in defence documents: 'She was in no way informed about how HSBC decided to structure the organisation of the funds she entrusted it with.'

They added that they were considering an appeal against sentence. Ricci was the first of more than 50 high-profile French nationals being pursued in the courts for using Swiss accounts to hide their money.

The judgment came after HSBC Holdings was formally placed under criminal investigation for complicity in fiscal fraud and illegal selling via its Swiss arm for two years starting in 2006.

Nina Ricci â real name Maria Adelaide Nielli â was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970.

Deputy Chairwoman of the Kuntsevsky District Court of Moscow.

UKHNALYOVA, Svetlana Vladimirovna was born on March 14, 1973. By presidential decree #711 of May 31, 2004, she was appointed judge of the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow. By decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 1, 2012 #1583, Svetlana Ukhnalyova was appointed the Deputy Chairwoman of the Kuntsevsky District Court.

Accused of:

Carrying out political repressions using her official position.

Judge Svetlana Uhnalyova was included in the Magnitsky Actâs list of international human rights violators. She has repeatedly participated in political-criminal prosecutions of opposition activists ranging from liberals to nationalists. She also participated in the Moscow Case, a politically motivated criminal prosecution of opposition activists who protested in the summer of 2019 against the prohibition of independent candidates from running in the Moscow City Duma elections.

In June 2009, she, as a judge of the Tverskoy District Court, extended the detention of Sergei Magnitsky and rejected his complaints about being transferred to the temporary detention center without notifying relatives, and refused the request to let his wife represent him. Note that prior to this Magnitsky and representatives of the Hermitage Capital investment fund had revealed the participation of senior law enforcement officials in the embezzlement of 5.4 billion rubles from the Russian budget through a fictitious VAT refund. Sergei Magnitsky spent almost a year in custody and died in jail in November 2009 after torture and denial of medical care. In July 2011, the U.S. Department of State adopted a sanctions list of Russian officials involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky who were denied entry to the United States and whose bank accounts there will now be frozen. Judge Ukhnalyova also got on this list. The European Parliament adopted the Magnitsky Act in 2014.

On February 11, 2010, Judge Ukhnalyova refused to recognize the arrest of opposition leader Ilya Yashin on December 31, 2010, during a rally on Triumfalnaya Square as unlawful. Judge Ukhnaleva is an expert on Kremlin-disloyal nationalists. In 2010, in the framework of the case of nationalist protests on Manezhnaya Square, she sentenced a group of defendants. In 2012, she sentenced Vitaly Vasin to three years probation, Grigory Bilchenko to two years probation, Vladimir Kirpichnikov to three years in prison, and Nikolai Dvoinyakov to two years in prison. After these politically motivated cases, Ukhnalyova got a career promotion, becoming Deputy Chairperson of the Kuntsevsky district court.

In 2019, Judge Ukhnalyova led the case of Egor Zhukov, a blogger-student of the Higher School of Economics, who was accused of âpublic calls for extremismâ on his YouTube channel. According to Tatyana Usmanova, coordinator of the Open Russia movement in Moscow, Ukhnalyova âbannedâ all independent linguists and their expertise during the trial. She refused to call the investigator, who, according to the defense, may have exceeded his authority.â Egor Zhukov, a libertarian, participated in an unauthorized rally in support of independent candidates to the Moscow City Duma on July 27 in Moscow. He was detained on August 2. Initially, he was charged with participation in the riots (Article 212 of the Criminal Code), but then this charge was dropped, and the student was transferred from the detention center to house arrest. However, later a new criminal case was opened against him, about calls for extremist activity on the Internet (Article 280 of the Criminal Code). Investigators and prosecutors, based on a linguistic study by an employee of the FSB Criminalistics Institute, Alexander Korshikov, argued that Egor Zhukov called for âviolent changes in the constitutional system, riots and obstruction of the activities of state bodies, local authorities and election commissionsâ in a video on his YouTube channel. On December 6, 2019, Judge Ukhnalyova sentenced Zhukov to 3 years in prison with a ban on âadministering sites on the Internet.â",am

Tech titan John McAfee has been indicted for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns, according to charges announced by the Department of Justice Wednesday.

The June 15 indictment was unsealed following McAfeeâs arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition.

According to the indictment, McAfee allegedly earned millions from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.

From 2014 to 2018, McAfee allegedly failed to file tax returns, despite receiving considerable income from these sources. The indictment does not allege that during these years McAfee received any income or had any connection with the anti-virus company bearing his name which was sold to Intel in 2011.

The tech titan is no stranger to run-ins with the law, Last July he was arrested -- and eventually released -- by the Dominican Republic Armed Forces in Puerto Plata following tweets with pictures of him on his boat with high-caliber weapons.

In 2012, he was arrested in Guatemala for illegally crossing the border from Belize to Guatemala in an attempt to find asylum from police in Belize. The software legend was under investigation in connection to the shooting death of a neighbor.

His Twitter feed is filled with colorful posts.

McAfee allegedly evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.

The indictment also alleges McAfee attempted to evade the IRS by concealing assets, including real property, a vehicle, and a yacht, in the names of others.

If convicted, McAfee faces up to five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and up to one year in prison on each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

McAfee had hoped to make a presidential bid this year. He announced his White House plans to seek the Libertarian Party nomination in 2018. However, this past March he suddenly endorsed Libertarian candidate Vermin Supreme and said he would seek the second spot on the party's ticket, which he did not receive.",am
135,"A federal grand jury in San Francisco, California, returned a 39 count indictment charging Robert T. Brockman, the Chief Executive Officer of an Ohio-based software company, with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Tax Division, U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California, and Chief of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Jim Lee. The charges stem from an alleged decades-long scheme to conceal approximately $2 billion in income from the IRS as well as a scheme to defraud investors in the software companyâs debt securities.

âTodayâs indictment reflects the Department of Justiceâs commitment to finding and prosecuting the costliest and most sophisticated tax crimes in the United States,â said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division Richard E. Zuckerman.

âComplexity will not hide crime from law enforcement,â said U.S. Attorney Anderson. âSophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges. We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.â

âAs alleged, Mr. Brockman is responsible for carrying out an approximately two billion dollar tax evasion scheme,â said Jim Lee, Chief of IRS Criminal Investigation. âIRS Criminal Investigation aggressively pursues tax cheats domestically and abroad. No scheme is too complex or sophisticated for our investigators. Those hiding income or assets offshore are encouraged to come forward and voluntarily disclose their holdings.â

According to the indictment, Brockman, a resident of Houston, Texas, and Pitkin County, Colorado, used a web of offshore entities based in Bermuda and Nevis to hide from the IRS income earned on his investments in private equity funds which were managed by a San Francisco-based investment firm. As part of the alleged scheme, Brockman directed untaxed capital gains income to secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. The indictment further alleges that to execute the fraud, between 1999 and 2019, Brockman took measures such as backdating records and using encrypted communications and code words to communicate with a co-conspirator, among other alleged actions.

In addition to the tax offenses, the indictment alleges that, between 2008 and 2010, Brockman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $67.8 million in the software companyâs debt securities. As CEO, Brockman was contractually restricted from purchasing any of the software companyâs debt securities without prior notice, full disclosure, and amending the associated credit agreements. The indictment alleges that Brockman used a third-party to circumvent those requirements, to acquire the debt securities, and to conceal from the sellers valuable economic information. The indictment further alleges that Brockman used material, non-public information about the software company to make decisions about purchasing the debt. In addition, Brockman allegedly persuaded another individual to alter, destroy, and mutilate documents and computer evidence with the intent to impair the use of such evidence in a grand jury investigation.

Brockman is charged with conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371; seven counts of tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. Â§ 7201; six counts of failing to file foreign bank account reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5314 & 5322(b); 20 counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343; two counts of concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)), and tax evasion money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(ii)); and one count each of international concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)); evidence tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1512(b)(2)(B), and destruction of evidence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1512(c)(1).

An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Brockman potentially faces a substantial period of incarceration, as well as restitution and criminal forfeiture. Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553.

Brockman is scheduled to make his initial federal court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael M. Cousins today.

The case is being prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Corey Smith of the Tax Division, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael G. Pitman, and Trial Attorneys Lee Langston and Christopher Magnani of the Tax Division. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the Departmentâs Criminal Division also provided extensive assistance in this matter.",am

A comprehensive dossier exposes Zanu PF Shamva North MP, Nicholas Tasunungurwa Goche, as having led violent and murderous campaigns in his constituency that led to the deaths of dozens of opposition activists and serious injury to hundreds.

The transport ministerâs trail of brutality âstretches as far back as the 2000 parliamentary elections when scores of perceived opposition activists were butchered in and around the Shamva Gold mine areas.â Goche and his gangs used so-called âpungweâ (re-education) sessions to carry out these attacks.

After MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the March 2008 presidential election the Joint Operations Command (JOC), a grouping of all the state security agencies, responded with the brutal Operation Mavhotera Papi (where did you vote).

The figures are hard to confirm but its estimated nearly 500 perceived MDC-T supporters were killed, while tens of thousands were tortured and maimed. Goche meanwhile was busy playing his part in Shamva.

On the 11th May 2008 his mob descended on Elias Kahari Madzivanziraâs homestead. âThey accused the family of being MDC supporters and they started randomly beating up everyone in sight and destroying whatever they could lay their hands on,â witness statements in the dossier say.

Elias was struck on the head with an axe and witnesses said his head split in two and he died on the spot. His wife Erica was also beaten up but survived. The perpetrators are well known in the local resettlement area and were seen in the company of Goche during the day, drinking beer and singing Mugabeâs praises.

Five days later on the 16th of May Goche addressed a campaign meeting at Chidembo School in the morning where he instructed all youths in the area to âguard their land jealouslyâ against what he called âthe whites re-invasion.â He told them to wipe out all MDC supporters in the area.

In his speech that day Goche mentioned Edson Zaya as a âknown sell out in the areaâ and the mob captured him at Chidembo Shopping centre in Shamva. Zaya was heavily assaulted for more than an hour and was badly injured. He died shortly after the assault on the same day.

On the 27th of May Gocheâs gang of ZANU PF youths dragged Kidwell Zvavamwe from his bed during the night. They assaulted him badly and he died from the injuries a week later. Kidwellâs wife Lucia Mukaru said that the youths barred her husband from seeking medical help.

In other incidents the youths;

âDragged Roy Barwa from his hut with a wire tied around his neck like a leash and his face covered with a red cloth, which they said represented death. They destroyed his homestead burning all what was inside the huts. His entire family was assaulted, including the children and the mother.â

The mob was also responsible for the abduction of Florence Muponya from her home. They also beat up her husband before burning all the huts, kraals and a car. Showing the impunity with which Goche and his gang operated, the incident was reported to the police but Goche ordered the police to arrest his victims instead.

Muponya and her family were made to face political violence charges before the court in Bindura. The charges were subsequently thrown out.

It is remarkable given this background that Goche is one of ZANU PFâs key negotiators of the Global Political agreement (GPA), and in fact he was part of the team that crafted the GPA that shaped the coalition government.

In March this year, Goche was in the news when High Court Judge, Justice Charles Hungwe granted the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission permission to search his ministerial offices and those of Mines minister Obert Mpofu and Indigenisation minister Saviour Kasukuwere.

The commission also pounced on the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board (NIEEB) and Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) offices which fall under Kasukuwere and Goche respectively. It was only Justice George Chiweshe who blocked the searches.

Chiweshe is a key Mugabe ally who as past chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission withheld presidential election results for weeks in March 2008, amid reports the period was used to manipulate and massage the figures that denied Morgan Tsvangirai an outright victory over a shocked Mugabe.",am
137,"When at the end of May French prosecutors filed preliminary charges against Qatari businessman Yousef al-Obaidly in connection with suspected bribery, the quake rippled all the way to the United Nations headquarters in New York.

Al-Obaidly, chief executive of BeIN Media, was charged in connection with suspected bribery so that his country would be successful in its bid to host the track and field world championships and the 2020 Olympic Games. French newspaper Le Monde reported in November 2016 that a former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) official received two payments totaling around $3.5M from Qatari investors before the vote for the 2017 world championships host nation.

According to the Guardian, ""disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, just before the $3.5M payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.""

The payments were made by Oryx Qatar Sports Investments. Al-Obaidly's media company profited substantially from broadcasting and licensing rights, because BeIN Media is closely linked to the fund. The IAAF Championships were eventually awarded to London, but the ongoing investigations highlight Qatar's flagrant disregard for international law and its use of government-sanctioned bribery.

Even Qatar's own anti-corruption unit appears to be corrupt.

The chairman of the board of trustees of the Qatar-based ""Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Center"" (ROLACC), Ali Bin Fetais Al Marri, who is also the country's attorney general, owns several properties that are substantially outside what a civil servant in Qatar would be able to afford. On a salary of a maximum of $12,000 per month, Al Marri has been able to purchase a â¬9.6M ($10.6M) mansion in Paris, close to the Arc de Triomphe, a CHF7M ($7.1M) villa in Cologny, Geneva's most expensive neighborhood, and an office in Geneva for CHF3.69M ($3.74M), which Al Marri rents out to the ROLACC dependence in the Swiss city.

How the ROLACC founder â and apparently chief corruption-fighter in Qatar â has been able to profit privately from letting his Geneva property to his anti-corruption agency is unclear. The office at Route de Ferney 221 was purchased in November 2015 through GSG Immobilier SA, of which Al Marri holds 99%.

ROLACC and Al Marri are of international significance, and it risks making a mockery of the U.S.-backed United Nations. Indeed, ROLACC signed an agreement on fighting corruption in sports with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in January this year â two months before the charges against Yousef al-Obaidly were first made by the French courts.

In 2017, the U.S. was the second main funder of the UNODC. American taxpayers should not be subsidizing unaccountable international civil servants who sign partnerships with dodgy organizations. In particular, the U.S. delegation to the U.N. should use its significant power to reform the UNODC. Congress should also revise its financial support to the UNODC in the face of state-sponsored corruption in Qatar.",am
138,"Former Zimra revenue officer Mr Kennedy Nyatoti has made history by becoming the first person to lose assets under Zimbabweâs civil-based asset forfeiture law when his US$150 000 mansion and US$10 000 car were forfeited to the State after he and his divorced wife failed to explain how they could afford these.

Mr Nyatotiâs lawful income between October 2014 and May 2018 was US$44 907, and it was established that he neither had private income nor was he running a private business.

So he failed to explain how he managed to build the US$150 000 mansion in Mabvazuva suburb in Harare and buy a Honda CRV valued at US$10 000.

Zimraâs lifestyle audit team discovered the mansion and car, after perusing the claims made during the divorce proceedings between Mr Nyatoti and his wife.

Investigations established Mr Nyatoti never ran a legitimate business during the period in question, neither did he prove any payment of income tax regarding the funds needed to build the house.

A court application was made for civil forfeiture in terms of the amended Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act and the High Court ordered forfeiture of the mansion and the car.

Previously, the State could only apply for forfeiture after a conviction for a corruption-related offence.

However, the new law now allows the State to apply for forfeiture under civil rules even without instituting criminal proceedings.

The main difference is that in civil cases a party only has to make a case on the balance of probabilities, but in a criminal case the rule is proof beyond reasonable doubt. So even if corruption was probable, but not proved, under the old rules the person kept the assets. Under the new law they can lose these.

If one fails to justify his or her wealth as required by law, the State can successfully forfeit the unexplained wealth.

Prosecutor General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi hailed the courtâs decision saying processes were now underway to transfer ownership of the house and the car to the State.

Mr Hodzi said the new civil forfeiture law was a more effective in recovering funds lost through corruption or fraud.

Mr Nyatotiâs woes mounted when he parted ways with his wife. The divorce proceedings exposed Mr Nyatoti as someone living an expensive lifestyle well beyond his earnings.

Both Mr Nyatoti and his wife, Ms Tatenda Chisadza, were taken to court after failing to explain how they managed to build the property in Harareâs Mabvazuva suburb when his earnings during the period under review only amounted to US$44 900.

Investigations by Zimra also revealed that besides constructing a luxurious house, Mr Nyatoti allegedly paid lobola amounting to US$10 000 in 2016 before taking his family on a trip to China at a cost of US$15 000 in November 2017.

Principal Public Prosecutor Mr Kelvin Mufute said he was satisfied that the coupleâs identified property constitutes proceeds of crime and was, therefore, tainted.

Mr Mufute further said Mr Nyatoti acquired a Honda CRV valued at US$6 000 which he registered under Ms Chisadzaâs name, a Nissan Skyline valued at US$4 000 for his sister, built a house worth US$150 000 in Mabvazuva, Harare, and bought a Honda Fit registered under his motherâs name.

The court agreed that the assets could not have been acquired under the known income of the couple.

Buttressing the Stateâs case, Zimraâs loss control officer Mr Blessing Majoni submitted that his investigations had established that Nyatoti abused his office and obtained the funds through corrupt means, adding he even tried to hide behind his sister, Portia, in a bid to justify how he acquired his wealth.

But Portia could not have had the money either. Mr Majoni said Nyatoti lied about the amounts spent on vehicle imports, which was later verified by Zimra.",am
139,"John Kapoor, the founder and former chief executive officer of Insys Therapeutics, has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for the role his company played in the opioid epidemic. Kapoor is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be held liable for the increasing opioid crisis.

Kapoor was found guilty in May 2019 of orchestrating kickback schemes to encourage doctors to boost prescriptions of Subsys, a powerful pain killer. For his role in that plan, Kapoor was sentenced to 66 months in prison Thursday afternoon. Prosecutors had hoped Kapoor, 76, would receive about 15 years in prison but Kapoorâs defense team had requested only one year in prison due to Kapoorâs advanced age. When U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs announced the sentencing, she said she arrived at the 66 months sentence due to Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as ""his central role in the crime,â NPR reported, citing The Associated Press.

During the sentencing, several patients spoke about the suffering they went through after being prescribed high doses of Subsys from the doctors who were paid by Insys, the AP said. Some of the patients said the drug made their teeth fall out and also left them with memory loss. There were also stories of becoming addicted to opioids due to the doctors pushing the drug on them. One woman, Deborah Fuller, told the court about her daughter who died of an overdose at the age of 32, the AP said.

Kapoor offered an apology at the sentencing. He said he was â heartbroken by the words of the patientsâ who spoke at both the sentencing and his trial.

U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling told reporters following the sentencing that he objected to the lesser sentence.

âMy view is that the public interest demanded higher sentences for these defendants,â Lelling said, according to the AP. âThese guys basically took a publicly traded pharma company and turned it into an engine for corrupting doctors and jeopardizing the health of men and women nationwide.â

Kapoorâs sentencing comes days after his colleague, Michael J. Gurry, the former Vice President of Managed Markets, was sentenced to 33 months for his role in the Subsys scheme. Kapoor, Gurry and other Insys executives, including Richard M. Simon, the former National Director of Sales; Sunrise Lee, a former Regional Sales Director; and Joseph A. Rowan, a former Regional Sales Director; were found guilty of violating the RICO Act, for their role in the kickback schemes to boost prescriptions of Subsys, which was approved to treat the pain many cancer patients exhibit. On Thursday, Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role, NPR reported.

During the trials, the government showed that Kapoor and his sales team used data to identify practitioners who either prescribed unusually high volumes of rapid-onset opioids or had demonstrated a capacity to do so. Once they were identified, the sales team went to work to increase the number of new Subsys prescriptions, and to increase the dosage and number of units of Subsys, the government said. The kickbacks were often noted as âspeaker fees.â Additionally, the Insys team conspired to defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients, the government said. Prosecutors said Insys misled insurers regarding the true diagnosis of a patient in order to get approval for Subsys, which was to be prescribed to cancer patients.

Throughout the trial, sordid details of the methods used to persuade the prescribers were brought to light, including having an Insys sales manager perform a lap dance at a Chicago strip club for a doctor the company was trying to woo. Jurors were also introduced to a video from a 2015 sales conference of sales associates dancing with a giant bottle of the addictive fentanyl-based Subsys in a rap music video.

Kapoor will report to prison on March 5.",am
140,"Henry T. Nicholas III, the billionaire co-founder of Broadcom, and a friend are taking a plea deal sparing them prison time in a Las Vegas Strip hotel room drug case, their lawyers and a prosecutor told a judge this week.

Nicholas and co-defendant Ashley Christine Fargo, who both live in the Newport Beach area, will enter an âAlford pleaâ to two felony drug possession charges and will make a $1 million donation to an unspecified Las Vegas-area drug treatment and rehabilitation program, defense attorney David Chesnoff said.

Alford pleas acknowledge there is evidence to secure convictions, but do not admit guilt.

Prosecutor Brad Turner said he will drop five more serious drug trafficking charges, which stemmed from the amount of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and several psychedelic substances that police reported finding in hard-sided travel cases in their room in August 2018.

Nicholas had been locked out of the room at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, police have said, and Wynn Resorts security officers who broke through the latched door found Fargo âunresponsiveâ with a semi-deflated balloon in her mouth and a nitrous oxide gas canister in the room.

A police officer said he believed Fargo used the balloon to inhale nitrous oxide, commonly referred to as laughing gas, and Nicholas told police he brought the canister aboard his private jet to Las Vegas for ârecreational use,â according to an arrest report. Possession of nitrous oxide is not illegal.

Nicholas told police that he and Fargo had been partying at a strip club before he was locked out of the room.

Both he and Fargo denied ownership of the luggage containing drugs including marijuana, police said.

Nicholas and Fargo were not in court Wednesday but were scheduled to appear Aug. 9 to enter their pleas. Defense lawyers denied any suggestion that they might have been dealing drugs.

âBy no stretch of the imagination would anyone consider Dr. Nicholas or Ms. Fargo to be traffickers distributing drugs into the community,â Chesnoff and co-counsel Richard Schonfeld said in a statement with attorney David Brown, representing Fargo.

Nicholas, 60, founded Broadcom in 1991 with Henry Samueli in a Southern California condominium, got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UCLA in 1998 and retired in 2003 from the publicly traded computer software, semiconductor and infrastructure company. Forbes estimates his net worth now at more than $4 billion.

He was indicted in California in 2008 on federal securities and drug charges, but the charges were dismissed in 2010 after a judge cited misconduct and witness intimidation by prosecutors. Nicholas had been accused of providing methamphetamine and ecstasy to business executives.

Chesnoff and Turner told the judge in Las Vegas on Wednesday that Nicholas has no criminal record.

The Las Vegas case will be dismissed after one year if Nicholas and Fargo complete 250 hours of community service and twice monthly personal drug counseling. If not, they will face sentencing on drug possession charges with possible sentences of probation or up to four years in prison.

The plea deal announcement came a week after defense lawyers filed documents seeking dismissal of all seven drug charges.

They argued that no one could prove ownership of the two travel cases found in the room where Brown contends that Fargo was asleep, not unconscious, and woke up after Wynn Resorts security officers broke through the latched hotel room door.

The attorneys argued that people entered and left the hotel room over a period of several days after Fargo checked in and before Nicholas arrived.

The document did not address a police report saying hotel video showed a man and a woman who appeared to be Nicholas and Fargo each carrying a black hard-sided, airtight protective case about an hour before Fargo was found in the room.

Nicholasâ attorneys have emphasized his philanthropy and backing for the California crime victim advocacy law named for his sister, Marsalee âMarsyâ Nicholas. She was stalked and killed by an ex-boyfriend in the 1980s.

Eleven U.S. states, including Nevada, now have a version of the law, which aims to codify rights for crime victims and their families to confer with prosecutors and attend court proceedings.

Marsyâs Law for All, a campaign lobbying for similar laws in more states, praised what it called the âconclusionâ of Nicholasâ criminal case, saying in a statement on Wednesday that he still leads the organization.",am
141,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank imposed penalties of S$5.2 million ($3.95 million) on Standard Chartered Bank (SCBC) STAN.L and S$1.2 million on Standard Chartered Trust (Singapore) (SCTS) for breaching money laundering rules and terrorism financing safeguards.

In a statement on Monday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the breaches occurred when trust accounts of SCBSâ customers were transferred from Standard Chartered Trust (Guernsey) to SCTS from December 2015 to January 2016.

âMAS requires financial institutions to adequately assess money laundering risks when deciding whether to accept customers. They should also have in place good systems and processes to monitor customer transactions,â said MAS Deputy Managing Director Ong Chong Tee.

The MAS and Guernseyâs Financial Services Commission had been looking into Standard Charteredâs movement of some assets, mainly of Indonesian clients in late 2015, just before the Channel Island adopted new global rules on exchanging tax information.

âThe timing of the transfers raised questions of whether the clients were attempting to avoid their CRS reporting obligations. However, SCBS and SCTS did not adequately assess and mitigate against this risk factor, and also failed to file suspicious transaction reports in a timely manner,â MAS said.

In a statement, Standard Chartered conceded that it fell short of its own standards to mitigate risks but said it was taking action to rectify these deficiencies.

âWe ourselves identified the issue, we recognized that we werenât as diligent as we needed to be in the transfer of some trust assets from Guernsey to Singapore,â Standard Charteredâs CEO Bill Winters said at Credit Suisseâs annual Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong on Monday. âWe reported both our own shortcomings and also the action of our clients to the MAS,â

âThe important thing...is we are making investments necessary to make sure there is no repeat,â he said.

142,"PARIS (Reuters) - Lamine Diack, once one of the most powerful people in athletics, was convicted in France on Wednesday of running a clique that covered up Russian doping in return for bribes worth millions of dollars and sentenced to spend at least two years in jail.

The 87-year-old former head of world athleticsâ governing body was found guilty of taking kickbacks from athletes in return for concealing positive drug tests, which enabled them to continue competing, including at the 2012 London Olympics.

The court had heard how Diack solicited bribes totalling 3.45 million euros ($4.1 million) and paid off other officials at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to aid with the cover up.

He was also guilty of accepting Russian money to help finance Macky Sallâs 2012 presidential campaign in Senegal, Diackâs home country, the court ruled.

The former long-jumperâs actions had âundermined the values of athletics and the fight against dopingâ, the presiding judge said.

The court handed Diack a four-year prison sentence, two years of which are suspended and a fine of 500,000 euros. It also ordered him to pay 5 million euros in damages to World Athletics (formerly IAAF) together with his son and co-accused, Papa Massata Diack.

Lamine Diackâs lawyers said he was a scapegoat âsacrificed in the name of political correctnessâ, adding they would appeal the judgment which was unfair and inhumane.

He will remain under house arrest pending the appeal, which could last months.

WIDENING GRAFT PROBE

Diack led the IAAF from 1999 to 2015. In his testimony, he acknowledged slowing the handling of Russian doping cases between 2011-2013 to save a sponsorship deal with a Russian bank and avoid public scandal. But he denied the corruption allegations.

At the heart of the corruption scam alongside Diack was his son, Papa Massata.

Papa Massata, who fled France to Senegal after the French investigation began and was tried in absentia, was sentenced to five years in jail and hit with a 1 million euro fine.

Papa Massataâs lawyers in Senegal said he was denied a fair trial and would appeal.

At the outset of the trial, his Senegal-based lawyers asked that it be postponed on the grounds that COVID-19 restrictions meant they could not travel, yet the request was refused by the French judges.

French Investigators say Papa Massata is at the centre of years-long corruption probe that now spans Europe, Asia and the Americas, and includes the awarding of the 2020 Olympic Games to Tokyo and the 2016 Games to Rio de Janeiro.

In 2017, Papa Massata branded the accusation that he was part of a large corruption racket as âthe biggest lie in the history of world sport.â

Four other defendants were charged in the case: Habib Cisse, Diackâs former lawyer at the IAAF; Gabriel DollÃ©, who oversaw doping tests at the IAAF; former head of Russian athletics Valentin Balakhnichev, and former Russian athleticsâ head coach Alexei Melnikov.

All four were found guilty of corruption offences.

Balakhnichev, who also did not attend the hearing, told Reuters he too would appeal.

âI donât live in France,â he said. âWe have our own laws in Russia that protect Russian citizens.â

143,"Colombiaâs public prosecution on Friday arrested President Juan Manuel Santos â top adviser on regional issues on corruption charges, just when the president was visiting one of those regions.

Carlos Ecuardo Correa, the countryâs High Counselor for the Regions, became the first sitting administration official to be arrested on corruption charges since Santos took office in 2010.

According to the Prosecutor Generalâs Office, Correa engaged in corruption practices while he was mayor of the northern Colombian city of Monteria.

The top official voluntarily reported himself at the Prosecutor Generalâs Office after hearing about his impending arrest.

The latest corruption scandal follows a series of major corruption scandals regarding illegal funds entering the presidentâs 2010 and 2014 presidential campaigns.

Not just any top official

The arrest of the presidential adviser on region-specific issues couldnât come at a worse time for Santos.

The top official is partly responsible for the region-specific implementation of a peace deal with FARC guerrillas signed in November last year and already plagued with irregularities and delays.

Moreover, due to the region-specific nature of the peace deal, billions of dollars, both Colombian and foreign investments, are flowing into Colombiaâs diverse countryside that has long suffered state neglect while the capital grew to become half the countryâs GDP.

This makes the arrest of the top adviser on such a critical element of the peace process, not just a national, but a diplomatic embarrassment for President Juan Manuel Santos.

The president is widely rejected partly due to the controversial implementation of the peace deal and partly because his apparent inability to curb corruption that has plagued the country since its inception.

Santos did not immediately respond to the arrest of his top adviser.

Santos embarrassed from Choco to Brussels

While his adviser on the regions was being read his rights, the president was in Choco, a pacific province that just weeks ago rose up over the stateâs chronic state neglect, rampant corruption and violence. Correa was Santosâ main adviser over, among others, this region.

The province has a poverty rate exceeding 60%, no paved road connecting it to the rest of the country, and is overrun by illegal armed groups that have already left more than one third of the population victim of the armed conflict.

We must prioritize the breaches between the regions, give more importance to those regions who are behind most. Of course, Choco is one of them.

President Juan Manuel Santos

Santos was harshly reminded of how Colombiaâs epidemic corruption and state neglect is causing extreme suffering among those living away from the capital by local resident Clorayne Galleo, whose expression alone spoke volumes.

Mr. Santos, look me straight in the face. This Choco you say you love I fight for day by day, while your police officers and ESMAD [riot unit] mistreat me constantly. Iâve also been a victim of the âdeath ride.â Youâre going to have to work on healthcare too.

The âdeath rideâ is is local term for a patient dying while waiting for medical treatment or searching for a hospital that is open. According to the photographer, the womanâs niece died in one of those death rides just a few months ago as the intensive care unit she needed doesnât exist in the capital of Choco.

This type of elementary deficiencies in the state system are virtually nationwide, particularly in the rural areas that have proven a perfect petri dish for illegal armed groups.

In whose pockets will the international peace aid end up?

The arrest of the counselor who was responsible exactly to reduce this kind of state neglect did not just ruin Santosâ visit to Choco, it further deteriorates a public lack of confidence in their Bogota government and undermines diplomatic confidence foreign peace funds do not disappear in the pockets of corrupt officials.

144,"The latest data dump of the Panama Papers has linked two of the richest families in Honduras, both with an ambiguous position on the 2009 U.S.-backed coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, to offshore companies set up in tax havens through the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

Jaime Rosenthal and Gilberto Goldstein are both prominent Honduran business moguls with holdings across media, banks, real estate, food products, and more. Their families are also connected by marriage through Jaimeâs nephew Yankel Rosenthal and Gilbertoâs daughter.

According to Panama Papers data released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Rosenthalâs only brother Edwin Mayer was the officer of an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands under the name Pinkenton International Corporation. One of Rosenthalâs sons, Cesar Augusto, was the sole shareholder of a Panamanian entity called Renton Management S.A.

The Rosenthal family controls Grupo Continental, a conglomerate of dozens of companies including Banco Continental, the newspaper El Tiempo and other media, a crocodile farm for leather exports, and sugar, banana, coffee, and cacao companies, among other businesses. Three Rosenthals, including head of the family, Jaime, were linked to money laundering and drug trafficking last year.

Jaime Rosenthal is a key member of the Honduran Liberal Party, the former party of ousted President Manuel Zelaya before he was removed from office, and has reportedly spoken out against the coup. But the Rosenthals may have suffered a breakdown with Zelaya before the coup.

Jaimeâs son Yani was appointed Minister of the Presidency when Zelaya came to power in 2006. Yani left the post at the end of 2007 to run in the partyâs internal elections, but instead joined forces with the political current led by Roberto Micheletti, the Liberal Party figure who headed the coup regime as illegitimate president after Zelaya was ousted in 2009.

Goldstein, on the other hand, is a backer of the National Party, which has traditionally traded power with the Liberal Party and returned to Hondurasâ top office after the 2009 coup.

In the Panama Papers database, Gilberto Goldstein and his deceased son Mark are both listed as shareholders in the British Virgin Islands entity Melston Investment Ltd.

According to Honduran researcher Leticia Salomon, both Rosenthal and Goldstein had ambiguous and chameleon-like stances on the 2009 coup.",am
145,"Jerusalem (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Jerusalem's District Court on Sunday, denouncing the charges against him as his trial on corruption charges got underway.

In three cases outlining separate allegations of wrongdoing, the premier stands charged with one count of bribery and three counts of fraud and breach of trust. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has appeared in court as a defendant.

In the most serious case, Netanyahu is accused of advancing regulatory benefits worth more than 1 billion shekels (more than $283 million) in favor a telecommunications company controlled by a millionaire friend, prosecutors say. In exchange, Netanyahu received favorable coverage from a news site, even influencing wording and story selection, prosecutors allege.

Sunday's proceedings were finished in under an hour, as they were mostly procedural.

""I read the indictment and I understand its content,"" Netanyahu told the court.

He did not enter a plea, but he has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence.

Before taking his place in the courtroom, he made a statement with senior members of his Likud Party standing behind him.

He described his indictments as a ""stitch-up"" -- an effort by Israel's liberal and media elites to topple him and his right-wing bloc.

The media was looking only to film him sitting on the bench in court, Netanyahu said, adding that he would ask the court to transmit the entire trial live.

""I am here as your Prime Minister, with straight back and proud,"" he told those watching at home. ""When the public is exposed to the whole truth, the cases will crumble.""

Participants in the small district courtroom wore masks, even while speaking. As the three judges entered, Netanyahu remained standing. He sat only after a cameraman had been ushered out of the room, per an earlier agreement on court procedures.

In discussions about the timetable, defense lawyer Micha Fetman said he was new to the team and needed time to read all the material, which prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari Shweky said would take about three months.

Fetman requested all defendants -- Netanyahu, along with two businessmen and one of the businessmen's wives -- be excused from attending every court session, procedural hearings in particular, and the prosecution did not oppose the move.

Proceedings were adjourned until July 19, though it could be months before the prosecution opens.

Under Israeli law, Netanyahu does not have to resign because of the indictment. Instead, he has to resign only if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.

November 2019: Netanyahu charged 03:07

In a tweet sent as the court session was coming to a close, Netanyahu's key coalition ally, Benny Gantz, wrote Netanyahu was innocent until proved guilty and expressed confidence the legal system would provide the Prime Minister with a fair trial.

Gantz, Israel's new alternate prime minister, previously had campaigned in three elections on a platform of never sitting in the same government as an indicted prime minster.

""I would like to reemphasize that my colleagues and I fully trust our legal system and law enforcement agencies. Now, perhaps more than ever, we must move toward unity and conciliation, as a country and as a society, for the State of Israel and all of its citizens,"" Gantz's tweeted Sunday.

A woman jailed for controlling prostitutes across the country has been ordered to pay back more than Â£400,000.

Sun Sun Wong, 45, was sentenced to five years in February 2018 for two counts of controlling prostitution for gain - and one count of money laundering.

She was caught after police posed as clients in an operation in Cambridge to safeguard vulnerable women.

Wong, of Blucher Street, Birmingham, was ordered to pay Â£442,260.50 after a proceeds of crime hearing.

At Peterborough Crown Court, Judge Matthew Lowe ordered she had three months to repay the money.

'Crime doesn't pay'

Cambridgeshire Police said that in October 2015, January 2016 and February 2016 undercover officers had arranged to meet with two women and were given an address in Midsummer Court, Cambridge.

The force said that each time they were greeted by lone women who did not have the mobile phone used to make the appointment.

In February 2016, they met a woman in Blucher Street, Birmingham.

The properties were being rented out by Wong and her mobile phone number was linked to the accounts set up in the names of various prostitutes.

Police said Wong denied any wrongdoing, claiming a woman called Anita had used her identity to carry out the crimes.

Det Con Andrew McKeane said the hearing on Thursday ""demonstrates that crime doesn't pay"".

""It has ensured that Wong will be stripped of the profit she made from her crimes, and is a fitting conclusion to the appalling offences she has committed.",am

The UN has dropped sanctions against former Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, paving the way for him to return to the country.

The Afghan government asked for the move as part of a deal with Mr Hekmatyar and his militant group in September.

The deal grants him immunity in return for support for the Afghan constitution and a promise to abandon violence.

He fought the Soviet occupation but was later accused of shelling civilians.

Mr Hekmatyar is also a former Afghan prime minister and his Hezb-e-Islami militant group is the second biggest in the country.

He was forced to flee Kabul in 1996 when the Taliban came to power and in 2003 was designated as a terrorist by the US.

Mr Hekmatyar's whereabouts remain unknown. He did not attend the signing ceremony in Kabul for the deal with the government.

Under the UN Security Council move, his assets are unfrozen and a travel ban is rescinded.

As a guerrilla leader in the 1980s, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had air of icy menace about him that hinted at ruthless ambition, a characteristic he demonstrated to the full during the ferocious power-struggle that followed the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

He became known as the Butcher of Kabul for his faction's indiscriminate firing of rockets into the capital. The death and destruction this caused led many Afghans to welcome the takeover of the Taliban.

Once one of the main recipients of western aid, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was deeply hostile to the west and was later accused by the US state department of supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

The deal between Mr Hekmatyar and the Afghan government was seen as being highly symbolic because it is the first to be concluded without UN or international mediation.

BBC Afghan Service editor Waheed Massoud said Mr Hekmatyar appeared to have calculated that he would be more significant as a political leader in Kabul than as the leader of a group of fighters up in the mountains who are also competing with the Taliban for influence.",am
150,"A California couple pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to commit mail fraud and tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departmentâs Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. for the Southern District of California.

According to court documents and statements made in court, married couple Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill operated On Your Feet (OYF), also known as Family Resource Center, a tax-exempt charitable organization whose stated mission was to provide assistance to low income families and individuals in need. From 2011 through 2016, the Hills fraudulently obtained more than $1.35 million in donated clothing and other items by falsely representing to the donors that the items would be given to needy recipients. In fact, the Hills made charitable donations of only about $13,000, sold the remaining donated items, and used the proceeds to financially enrich themselves and others. To conceal their conduct from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Hills filed false charitable tax returns for OYF and false personal tax returns that did not report the income they received from their scheme.

âThe Hills not only evaded their taxes, but they did so by abusing their companyâs tax-exempt charitable status and thereby cheated not only the public fisc but the donors and intended beneficiaries of the donations,â said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman. âAs the guilty pleas make clear, this conduct will not go unpunished.â

âI am committed to using the resources of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office in the Southern District of California to aggressively pursue fraudsters and tax cheats,â said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer Jr. for the Southern District of California. âThe conduct by Geraldine and Clayton Hill is particularly offensive because they used the benefits afforded by the 501(c)(3) status of their charity to defraud donors and conceal their profits. By abusing the generosity of companies and individuals who put their faith in the promises made by the Hills, the defendants threatened to undermine the trust and integrity underpinning charitable giving.â

âGeraldine Hill and Clayton Hill exploited the public trust and charitable giving by using their charity to solicit over $16 million in goods from hardworking businesses and falsely promising to donate those goods to assist low income families and individuals in need,â said Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. âInstead, the Hills resold the goods and profited over $1.34 million which they spent on vehicles, vacations, and entertainment, as well as personal expenses for their family members. The Hills concealed their fraud by filing false tax returns on behalf of the charity and failing to report their illicit income to the IRS. Their guilty pleas evidence the hard work of IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents to bring to justice those that defraud businesses in the name of charity, and who benefit themselves instead of serving those most in need.â

âWhile fraud is always wrong, the theft of charitable donations that were to be used to help San Diegoâs low income families is particularly disheartening,â said Acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Omer Meisel. âThis type of fraud and deceit for personal gain simply cannot be tolerated. The FBI is committed to ensuring that white collar predators donât prevent those less fortunate from receiving all the benefits that generous donors provide to seemingly legitimate non-profit organizations.â

U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 28, 2020. At sentencing, the Hills face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each mail fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. The Hills also face a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

151,"LAS VEGAS (KSNV) â China limits how much money one person convert into foreign currency each year. Two Las Vegas men who helped gamblers bypass that limit have found themselves in deep trouble with the IRS.

Las Vegas residents Bing Han and Lei Zhang have pleaded guilty to Operation of Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, the IRS announced on Monday.

According to the IRS, China-based customers would transfer money into Han and Zhang's Chinese bank accounts. In return, the men would transfer an equal amount of money in US Dollars their customer's US-based accounts. The two would then receive a commission for the money transferred.

Han and Zhang both say that casino hosts would regularly introduce customers to them. These customers, who were not legally allowed to convert more than $50,000 worth of Chinese Yuan each year, wanted more money to gamble with. Han and Zhang were more than willing to oblige. The casino hosts, the IRS stated, would often receive a cut of the commission.

These actions, the IRS says, violated both China's capital controls and the United States' anti-money-laundering laws.

âThe United States stands vigilant against the constantly evolving ways in which individuals and organizations seek to operate outside the conventional financial system,"" said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer. ""Violating United States anti-money laundering laws not only endangers the integrity of the global financial system, but doing so hinders the ability of law enforcement officers to confront criminal conduct including money laundering and narcotics trafficking.â

DEA Special Agent in Charge John W. Callery says that these laws are in place to prevent drug trafficking organizations from laundering money.

âAlthough Mr. Han and Mr. Zhang did not admit to transacting narcotics proceeds in their unlicensed money transmitting businesses, we know that drug trafficking organizations are willing to use a variety of businesses to launder proceeds from the sales of drugs,â said Callery. âDEA and our outstanding partners will continue to investigate illicit financial transactions and anyone who may operate businesses that stand to profit from illegal drug sales.â

Han and Zhang both face a maximum of five years in prison. Han is scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, and Zhang is scheduled to be sentenced on May 4. Both face a maximum of 5 years in prison.

No information about the casino hosts, or which resorts they worked for, was released by the IRS. It's unclear whether any of the hosts are being investigated.",am
152,"Former Zimbabwean president Robert Gabriel Mugabe finally fell on Tuesday. His spectacular downfall closed a chapter of Africaâs 1960s leaders who successfully liberated the masses, only to transform into some of the worst despots that these countries had seen.

Such a list includes late Malawian president Hastings Kamuzu Banda and Ugandaâs Yoweri Museveni.

It is particularly sad that Mugabe had to go the way he did. After all, this is a man who on taking over as the countryâs head of state, ensured that Zimbabweans had an education system that was the envy of the continent.

He also stood against former colonisers and the might of the apartheid state to ensure that the whole of southern Africa was liberated.

For some strange reasons Mugabe is a victim of his own making. After raising his status as a regional power broker he succumbed to the attractions of self enrichment, while his nation fell into poverty.

The list of his critical misdemeanours stretches from his wife Grace, to his children who continue to live as if there is no tomorrow.

Zimbabweâs second independence

So when Zimbabweans call the end of his era the second independence, it is understandable for a population that has not known any other leader but Mugabe.

But it also cast a spot on a rather impressive record of Africaâs visionaries such as Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere and Nnamdi Azikiwe, whose battle cry over the years was that Africaâs political liberation had to be followed by the economic emancipation of her children.

They emphasised that Pan-Africanism was critical to the continentâs economic and social progress.

It is this trajectory that has given way to a new era where the commitment to the selfless development of a people has been replaced by personal interests. Should the continent be worried? Should we be scared? Perhaps.

Mugabeâs era also indicated that Africa could be moving from a strategic path towards the collective development, and to self benefit. Talks about the free movement of goods and people across the continent seems to have given way to sectoral interests.

Former South African president Thabo Mbekiâs celebrated African Renaissance seems to be a thing of the past. It is a worrying trend, because it leaves the continent with no immediate economic recovery plan.

Obliterated

When Europe was obliterated to ashes by the ravages of World War II, the West came together and produced a plan to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernise industry and make the region more prosperous.

One of the key elements of the Marshall Plan was to discourage military coups (although these eventually took place in Turkey and Greece). It emphasised peace and democracy and encouraged dialogue between warring factions.

Something akin to what African Renaissance sought to do. Sadly, the African Union this week described the military takeover of Zimbabwe as intervention, endorsing the very people who have butchered the country and plundered its prospects to nothing.

The fact that the military carefully choreographed Mugabeâs exit from power does not take away its own complicity in Zimbabweâs economic downturn.

The generals were some of the biggest beneficiaries of Zimbabweâs chaotic land reform program that plunged the country from a bread basket into a basket case.

Together with Mugabe, they masterminded one of the bloodiest repressions against Zimbabweans. They also got well rewarded for assisting in the general plundering of national resources that brought the country to its knees and cost it some of its best brains to the four corners of the world.

In Mugabeâs world, it was okay for the rest of the population to live in abject poverty while he and his military backers lived comfortably.

Political elite

The incoming Emmerson Mnangagwa also helped Mugabe in ensuring that the rule of law only favoured the political elite. It is an era that has become all too familiar on the continent.

It is currently playing itself out in South African television screens where the parliamentary select committee on public enterprises is probing how a select few individuals came to reap benefits that were meant for all.

Nearly every witness has told of how they were called into meetings with the Guptas to sway tenders and businesses in the politically connected familyâs favour.

It is the modern politics of greed that has replaced a common purpose among many African states. It is characterised by how a minority lives an opulent life in the midst of poverty.

Obscene excesses

Just recently, Mugabeâs son, Chatunga, poured champagne on his $60,000 wrist watch, and proceeded to tell whoever cared to listen that he could do so because of his dadâs status.

Chatunga and his brother Robert Jr. are particularly known as centres of attraction in South Africaâs most exclusive nightclubs, where they binge on the most expensive of wines, while Zimbabweans continue to live on less than a dollar a day.

The richest woman in Africa, Isabel dos Santos, is the daughter of former Angolan president JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos â who ruled the African country for 38 years before stepping down last August.

In pre-Arab Spring Libya, Muammar Gaddafiâs son Saif was rumoured by Forbes magazine to be a billionaire who owned luxury villas as far afield as Vienna and counted a white pet tiger among his personal possessions.

President Jacob Zumaâs son, Duduzane, is probably one of a few millionaires in the world who has amassed a massive pile of wealth without any discernible entrepreneurial skill.

So while Mugabeâs downfall should be celebrated, it should at the same time be a chance for the continent to review its vision and to come out with a plan that will constrain military interventions, while encouraging openness and dialogue among its nations.

But that can only happen if our leaders master a political will to do so.",nam
153,"Who Was Charles Ponzi?

Charles Ponzi was the infamous swindler who payed out returns with other investors' money. The ""Ponzi scheme"" is named after him. After running a highly profitable and expansive investment scheme, Ponzi was arrested on August 12, 1920, and charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. Owing an estimated $7 million, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, and subsequently spent 14 years in prison.

Coming to America

The details of the infamous swindler Charles Ponzi's early life are difficult to verify. It is believed, however, that he was born Carlo Ponzi in Parma, Italy, and attended the University of Rome La Sapienza.

Ponzi arrived in Boston in November 1903 aboard the S.S. Vancouver. He later told the New York Times that he gambled away most of his money on the voyage to America. ""I landed in this country with $2.50 in cash and $1 million in hopes, and those hopes never left me."" The young immigrantâs charisma and confidence would help him pull off one of the greatest financial schemes in history.

Early Scams

Ponzi started out working odd jobs, including as a dishwasher in a restaurant. In 1907, he moved to Montreal, where he found a job as a teller at Bank Zarossi. The bank was formed to cater to the new Italian immigrant population, charging high interest rates.

When Bank Zarossi went bankrupt because of bad loans, Ponzi was left penniless. He was sentenced to three years in a Quebec prison after he was caught forging a bad check. Rather than tell his mother in Italy that he was in prison, he wrote to her in a letter that he was working at a Canadian prison.

When he was released from jail, Ponzi got involved in yet another criminal venture, smuggling Italian immigrants across the border into the United States. This too landed him in jailâhe spent two years behind bars in Atlanta.

Ponzi returned to Boston, where he married stenographer Rose Gnecco in 1918. He worked various jobs, including at his father-in-law's grocery store, but none of those positions lasted long.

It was during this time that Ponzi got the idea for the great scheme that would earn his name a place in history. He received a letter in the mail from a company in Spain that contained in it an international reply coupon (a coupon that can be exchanged for a number of priority airmail postage stamps from another country). Ponzi realized that he could turn a profit by buying IRCs in one country, and exchanging them for more expensive stamps in another country.

Ponzi's racket worked like this: He would send money to agents working for him in other countries, who would buy IRCs and send them back to the United States. Ponzi would then exchange the IRC for stamps worth more than he paid for them, and sell the stamps. Ponzi reportedly made more than 400 percent on some of these sales.

Not satisfied with running the profitable scheme on his own, Ponzi began to seek investors to turn even higher profits. He promised investors outrageous returns of 50 percent in 45 days, or 100 percent in 90 days. Ponzi paid these investors using money from other investors, rather than with actual profitâas in the criminal scheme of Bernie Madoff.

Ponzi's manipulation made him very richâhe bought a mansion in Lexington, Massachusetts, with air conditioning and a heated swimming pool. He reportedly made $250,000 a day.

Downfall and Death

Ponzi's scheme began to unravel in August 1920, when The Boston Post began to investigate his returns. The investigation set off a run on Ponzi's company, with investors trying to pull their money out of it.

Charles Ponzi was arrested on August 12, 1920, and charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. Owing an estimated $7 million, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, and subsequently spent 14 years in prison. Rose divorced him in 1937, and Ponzi died penniless in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on January 18, 1949.",am
154,"The U.S. Department of Stateâs Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on the activities, networks, and associates of Muhammad Kawtharani, a senior Hizballah military commander. This announcement is part of the Departmentâs standing reward offer for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of the terrorist organization Lebanese Hizballah.

Muhammad Kawtharani is a senior leader of Hizballahâs forces in Iraq and has taken over some of the political coordination of Iran-aligned paramilitary groups formerly organized by Qassim Sulemani after Sulemaniâs death in January. In this capacity, he facilitates the actions of groups operating outside the control of the Government of Iraq that have violently suppressed protests, attacked foreign diplomatic missions, and engaged in wide-spread organized criminal activity. As a member of Hizballahâs Political Council, Kawtharani has worked to promote Hizballahâs interests in Iraq, including Hizballah efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi Shiâa insurgent groups.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Kawtharani as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2013.

In April 2019, Rewards for Justice announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of the global terrorist organization Lebanese Hizballah.

Rewards can be provided for information leading to the identification and disruption of:

Sources of revenue for Hizballah or its key financial facilitation mechanisms;
Major Hizballah donors or financial facilitators;
Financial institutions or exchange houses facilitating Hizballah transactions;
Businesses or investments owned or controlled by Hizballah or its financiers;
Front companies engaged in international procurement of dual-use technology on behalf of Hizballah; and
Criminal schemes involving Hizballah members and supporters which financially benefit the organization.

Hizballah is a Lebanon-based terrorist organization that receives weapons, training, and funding from Iran, which the Secretary of State designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. Hizballah generates about a billion dollars a year from a combination of direct financial support from Iran, international businesses and investments, donor networks, and money laundering activities. The State Department designated Hizballah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in October 2001 under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224.

More information about these reward offers is located on the Rewards for Justice website at www.rewardsforjustice.net. We encourage anyone with information on Hizballah financial networks to contact the Rewards for Justice office via the website, e-mail (LH@rewardsforjustice.net), phone (1-800-877-3927 in North America), or mail (Rewards for Justice, Washington, D.C., 20520-0303, USA). Individuals may also contact the Regional Security Officer at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. All information will be kept strictly confidential.

The Rewards for Justice Program is an effective law enforcement tool and is administered by the U.S. Department of Stateâs Diplomatic Security Service. Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $150 million to more than 100 people who provided actionable information that helped bring terrorists to justice or prevented acts of international terrorism worldwide.

Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez leads an international drug-trafficking and money laundering organization based in Colombia that exported nearly 100 tons of cocaine per year, Treasury said. He also managed the daily narcotics trafficking operations of Jorge Fadlallah Cheaitelly, who was placed under sanctions in December 2011, Treasury said.

""These sanctions will expose Rodriguez Vasquez's illicit network of agents and front companies and exclude them from the legitimate financial system,"" said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in a statement.

In addition, Treasury placed sanctions on seven of Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez's associates, all of whom were indicted Feb. 14 in the Eastern District of Texas on drug-trafficking charges, Treasury said. As a result of arrest warrants and the indictment, Treasury said Colombian authorities arrested 11 people in August 2013, including Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez and four others targeted Wednesday with sanctions.

Those arrested were known to collaborate with the FARC rebels, as well as Mexico's Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Treasury said. Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez utilized FARC to protect cocaine labs in Colombia and to escort drug loads, and he provided Zetas members with tons of cocaine, which was ultimately distributed in the U.S., Treasury said.",am
156,"A prisoner ran a two-year-long drug smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone and mail, a court has heard.

Craig Sutton, 37, carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.

The offences only came to light when Sutton's cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.

He will be sentenced in October.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit Â£30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.

The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.

Letters seized

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton's cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.

A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.

""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson's bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""

Prisons investigation

Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.

Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""

Lord Burns said: ""It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.""",am

Israeli top model Bar Refaeli has been given a large fine and sentenced to nine months of community service for evading taxes.

The 35-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of providing false tax returns while living abroad in order to avoid Israeli taxes.

The court in Tel Aviv ordered her to pay a 2.5m-shekel fine (Â£577,000; $730,000), in addition to arrears.

The model's mother was also convicted of tax offences.

Tzipi Refaeli, who also acted as her daughter's agent, was sentenced to 16 months in prison and also ordered to pay a 2.5m-shekel penalty and taxes owed.

The two women pleaded guilty and were sentenced under a deal agreed with authorities last month.

Israeli authorities began their investigation into the case in 2015.

Bar Refaeli admitted to not declaring her worldwide income for certain years, claiming that she spent most of the time abroad, although her lawyers said she had not intentionally avoided the tax payments.

Her mother, meanwhile, was convicted of signing property leases under the names of relatives to obscure the model's residency status, among other charges.

The model, who previously dated US actor Leonardo DiCaprio and hosted the 2019 Eurovision song contest, has been involved in controversy during her career.

A fraudster is still a free man despite owing taxpayers a record Â£66million that he has failed to pay for a decade, a court has heard.

Gerald Smith, 68, had been ordered to pay Â£41million under Proceeds of Crime laws for stealing Â£35million in 2008.

Since then he has allegedly received assets worth Â£150million but still claims he is unable to settle up.

His debt rises Â£8,000 a day with interest and the total is three times larger than all illegal cash confiscated by the Metropolitan police in 2016-17.

Yet Smith â jailed at the time for eight years â recently spent Â£500,000 on a chandelier and Â£166,000 on flights, Folkestone magistrates heard. Kennedy Talbot, QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, said: âItâs extraordinary for a man who asserts he has no assets.â

Flights included two trips to Dubai at Â£84,000, Â£26,000 on a Vancouver flight, and a Â£24,000 Hong Kong visit.

Mr Talbot added: âThose sums are quite extraordinary and demand an explanation but you havenât been given one...Where are the funds?â

Mr Talbot also said Smith had a Jersey mansion valued at Â£12 million.

And properties allegedly bought with stolen money included 14 flats in London, worth Â£16 million; two villas in Mallorca worth Â£5 million; land in Italy and a ski lodge in Whistler, Canada.

Smith was handed assets âworth Â£150 million,â from F1 investor Andy Ruhan in 2016, the court heard.

Yet Smith has only paid back Â£4million of his debt. Mr Talbot said Smith had shown âwilful refusal and culpable neglectâ by failing to repay the cash and urged the court to consider jailing him.

Smith has claimed he wants to pay but is unable to do so because his wealth is tied up in assets he cannot access owing to ongoing complex civil litigation.

159,"The former chief executive of the top-performing New York Stock Exchange company in 1996 was ordered held without bail Friday on charges of insider trading, manipulating his companyâs inventory and securities fraud.

Emanuel Pinez, 58, an Israeli citizen who has homes in Canada, Switzerland and suburban Boston, was until Tuesday the head of Centennial Technologies Inc., which saw its stock price increase 450% during the year to reach $58.25.

Before his firing Tuesday, Pinez apparently told the companyâs board of directors that he inflated the amount of inventory sold, and he admitted advancing his own money to customers to buy the inventory, the U.S. attorney in Boston said.

The exchange halted trading in the stock of the personal computer card maker Tuesday, shortly before the firm said it had fired Pinez. Company shares have not traded since Monday, when it closed at $16.375.

Analysts expect the stock to open in the single digits when and if trading resumes.

FBI agents arrested Pinez at his Beverly, Mass., home early Friday after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging he âshortedâ his former company.

The federal complaint alleges that Pinez bought and sold more than 4,400 option contracts at a time when he had orchestrated a number of accounting improprieties that were being investigated by the companyâs board of directors.

Beginning Feb. 7, Pinez allegedly started buying put options and selling call options to expire on March 21, the complaint said. Call options give an investor the right to buy a stock at a certain price, while put options allow the sale at a certain price.

The SEC said Pinezâs minimum profit on the call options will be $447,500.

160,"R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Jonathan I. Solomon, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miami Field Office, announced that defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, a/k/a âHector Fabio Carvajal,â was sentenced earlier today by U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga to a term of imprisonment of 360 months (30 years), to be followed by five years of supervised release. Judge Altonaga deferred final determination of restitution until July 10, 2009 at 8:30 a.m.

Montoya Sanchezâs sentence follows his guilty plea on January 23, 2009, to conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S., in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 963; and obstruction of justice by murder, in violation of Title 18,United States Code, Sections 1503 and 1111.

As set forth in a written statement of facts submitted to the Court in conjunction with defendant Montoya Sanchezâs guilty plea, defendant Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Colombian-based North Valley Cartel cocaine trafficking organization led by his brother, co-defendant and former FBI top-ten most wanted fugitive Diego Montoya Sanchez. Starting in the early 1990s, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez assumed primary responsibility for managing Montoya organization drug finances. His role in this regard included maintaining and overseeing Montoya organization stash houses used to store cash drug proceeds.

According to the written statement of facts, the Montoya organization often maintained between $18 million and $20 million in cash drug proceeds collectively in its stash houses around Colombia, sometimes storing as much as between $6 million and $8 million in a single stash house. Defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez used organization drug proceeds to fund the organizationâs cocaine laboratories and pay an array of employees, including lab workers, cocaine transporters, and personnel who provided security and debt collection. He also invested drug proceeds in real estate and outside businesses.

In 1999, Die go Montoya Sanchez was indicted in the Southern District of Florida, and the charges were made public in 2000. Starting in approximately 2003, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez added to his duties by coordinating the shipment of multiple organization cocaine loads.

In early August 2003, Montoya organization operatives ambushed and murdered Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, a/k/a âDos Mil.â Prior to his murder, Garcia Giraldo had obtained and distributed cell phones and pagers for the Montoya organization. Fearing that Garcia Giraldo was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement, Diego Montoya Sanchez directed defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez to instruct a Montoya organization member to ambush Garcia Giraldo and beat information from him, particularly whether he was cooperating with authorities and what he had told them. Eugenio Montoya Sanchez conveyed the instructions to the organization member at a meeting in which they also discussed a strategy to lure Garcia Giraldo to a remote meeting location where they would abduct and interrogate him. Because of the Montoya organizationâs practice of interrogating and then killing those who they feared were cooperating with authorities, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez knew that the likely consequence was that Garcia Giraldo would be killed. Garcia Giraldo was successfully lured to a farm in a rural area outside of Cali, Colombia, where he was interrogated, beaten, and eventually killed. After the murder, the assailants disposed of Garcia Giraldoâs remains in a river.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez is the third Montoya family member to be convicted in this case. In 2005, the defendant's brother, co-defendant Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, co-defendant Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, were extradited to South Florida. In November 2005, both pled guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. and subsequently were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 21and 19 years, respectively. Diego Montoya Sanchez was extradited to South Florida on December 12, 2008, and is pending trial before Judge Altonaga.

Three additional co-defendants in the case were apprehended in Colombia in 2008 and are pending extradition to the United States. Gildardo Rodriguez Herrera, a/k/a âCamisa Roja,â a/k/a âCamisa,â a/k/a âEl SeÃ±or de la Camisa,â a/k/a âUrley Mena Rosales,â was captured on May 17, 2008. Jorge Ivan Urdinola Perea, a/k/a âIguana,â a/k/a âRaul,â a/k/a âDon Raul,â was captured on June 25, 2008. Oscar Varela Garcia, a/k/a âOmar Garcia Varela,â a/k/a âCapachivo,â was captured on July 5, 2008.

Mr. Acosta commended the investigative efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, Mr. Acosta thanked the Colombian government and all police departments involved for their cooperation and invaluable assistance in this matter. Mr. Acosta also thanked the Department of Justiceâs Office of International Affairs for its assistance. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis.

161,"Former Labour minister Elliot Morley has become the highest-profile parliamentarian to be jailed over the expenses scandal after he was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment for claiming more than Â£30,000 in false mortgage payments.

The 58-year-old former MP for Scunthorpe, who had admitted two charges of false accounting, was told he was guilty of ""blatant dishonesty"" and had ""thrown away his good name and good character"" in a fraud which ended ""a distinguished political career"" that spanned more than 20 years.

Sentencing him at Southwark crown court, Mr Justice Saunders described Morley's public downfall as ""tragic"".

Morley, who is diabetic and suffers from depression, had earlier wiped away tears as the court heard he had made a ""grotesque error of judgment"". He could be released on licence in four months.

""He had given honourable service to the public, not just to constituents but to the country as whole,"" said Jim Sturman, QC, defending. He had ""discharged onerous ministerial duties for almost a decade"". But now he faced ""a bleak and very uncertain future, especially at his age"".

He had also been stripped of a Â£64,000 resettlement grant he would normally receive on leaving parliament.

Peter Wright, for the prosecution, said Morley had ""engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system"".

The court was told that, between May 2004 and November 2007, Morley had ""on no fewer than 40 occasions"" falsely claimed Â£800 a month. Parliamentary rules entitled him to claim only mortgage payment interest on his second home. But while his interest varied from Â£52 per month in 2004 to Â£5.85 in February 2006, he continued to claim Â£800 a month.

He sought Â£15,200 in mortgage claims, when he was only entitled to Â£1,572. Between March 2006 and November 2007, after his mortgage had been repaid, he continued to submit the Â£800 monthly, claiming Â£16,800 towards a mortgage that did not exist.

He failed to respond to requests for further information from the Fees Office and ""evaded giving answers in the knowledge that to give truthful answers would reveal the fraud"", said Saunders.

When he was eventually challenged, he described it as an ""embarrassing and inadvertent oversight"" and immediately repaid the money.

Morley, who lost his post as environment minister in 2006, stood in the dock as the judge told him that in common with other MPs convicted over expenses, he was guilty of a ""serious breach of trust"". It was "" arguably worse"" in his case because he was a minister.

The judge was satisfied the ""excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable even in part by oversight"".

He allowed a 25% discount of the sentence because of the ""courage"" it had taken for Morley to enter a guilty plea. He avoided a longer sentence, despite claiming more money than other MPs convicted, because ""the degree of sophistication"" involved in the fraud was less.

The judge also made ""some small further reduction"" in sentence in light of Morley's public service. He had read ""a truly remarkable series of testimonials"" from many distinguished people describing him as a ""positive force for good""",am

The wife of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been charged with money laundering and tax evasion, as part of an investigation into a massive corruption scandal.

Rosmah Mansor, who is known for her love of luxury goods and jewellery, pleaded not guilty to all 17 charges.

Her husband, Mr Najib, has been accused of pocketing $700m (Â£517m) from state development fund 1MDB.

Mr Najib currently faces 32 different charges in relation to 1MDB.

Ms Rosmah smiled, wave and blew kisses at the media as she arrived in a Kuala Lumpur court on Thursday.

The 66-year-old had spent a night in detention following her arrest by anti-corruption officials on Wednesday.

Bail for Ms Rosmah was set at 2m ringgit ($483,200; Â£373,127). Prosecutors had originally sought 10m ringgit in bail.

Mr Najib also appeared at another courtroom in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday for a separate pre-trial hearing.

1MDB, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn Kuala Lumpur into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments.

But it started to attract negative attention in early 2015 after it missed payments for some of the $11bn it owed to banks and bondholders.

Then the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Mr Najib's personal bank accounts.

Mr Najib has consistently denied taking money from 1MDB or any public funds.

163,"MEXICO CITY â In some of the most explosive accusations in recent Mexican political history, the former head of the state-owned oil company directly accused former President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his treasury secretary of directing a scheme of kickbacks and embezzlement directly from the presidentâs office.

Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Petroleos Mexicanos who himself faces corruption charges, alleges PeÃ±a Nieto and Luis Videgaray used the state-owned Pemex as a conduit to âfulfill promises made during the (2012) campaign,â among other allegations he makes in a leaked 60-page document whose authenticity was confirmed by Mexican authorities Wednesday.

âEnrique PeÃ±a Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso created a scheme of corruption in the federal government, in which the common denominator was that all the people who supported in some way the presidential campaign had to be recompensed or repaid,â usually in the form of cushy government contracts, Lozoya wrote.

Lozoya also accused PeÃ±a Nieto and Videgaray of extortion, fraud and embezzlement.

âThe president and the afore-mentioned treasury secretary used me to create a criminal conspiracy aimed at enriching themselves, not only by (taking) government funds, but also by extorting money from individuals and companies, fraud and deceit,â he wrote.

The Associated Press obtained a copy of Lozoyaâs testimony, and its authenticity was confirmed first by two people with knowledge of the investigation and then by the federal Attorney Generalâs Office.

Lozoya was captured in southern Spain in February and extradited to Mexico in July to face charges he took over $4 million in bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. But Mexican prosecutors announced they had reached an agreement with Lozoya in which he could avoid jail in return for testifying about corruption in PeÃ±a Nietoâs 2012-2018 administration.

Lozoya worked as international relations coordinator of PeÃ±a Nietoâs campaign in 2012, and he told investigators the bribes paid by Odebrecht to Mexican officials were aimed at not only winning more lucrative public works contracts for the construction giant, but also at influencing Mexicoâs planned sweeping energy reform, enacted once PeÃ±a Nieto was in office.

Lozoyaâs job on the campaign was to obtain funding from foreign companies that could be used to pay foreign and Mexican consultants and to help position PeÃ±a Nietoâs image internationally.

In early 2012, Videgaray, who was PeÃ±a Nietoâs campaign manager, allegedly told Lozoya to request $6 million from Odebrecht and tell the company it would be rewarded when PeÃ±a Nieto won. Part of that reward would presumably be the openings for private companies contained in the 2013 energy reform of the state-controlled sector.

âAs part of the approval of the Pact for Mexico reforms, Enrique Pena Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso told me in February 2013 that large quantities of money would have to be paid to the opposition so that they would vote in favor of certain structural reforms of interest for President Enrique Pena Nieto,â Lozoya wrote. The cash was to be distributed in transparent plastic bags, so the politicians could see the bills, and in fact a video leaked earlier this week showed one such transaction.

Lozoya named at least a dozen leading opposition figures as participating in bribes, including the 2018 presidential candidate of PeÃ±a Nietoâs party, JosÃ© Antonio Meade, who had enjoyed a friendly relationship LÃ³pez Obrador. Lozoya said about $300,000 was given to Meade and other politicians.

Meade wrote in his Twitter account Wednesday: âI will not contribute to media scandals ... I have devoted my public life to building a better country, always with absolute honor and legality.â

The opposition politicians mentioned by Lozoya include a half dozen former senators, among them the current governor of the border state of Tamaulipas, Francisco GarcÃ­a Cabeza de Vaca. Lozoya also accused then-congressman Ricardo Anaya, who went on to become the 2018 presidential candidate for the conservative National Action Party, and other leading National Action figures.

Lozoya said former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also participated, allegedly acting on behalf of National Action, known as the PAN, though the ex-president was a member of PeÃ±a Nietoâs Institutional Revolutionary Party. Lozoya wrote that âthe attitude of the PAN members in obtaining resources (money) was brutal,â and that the partyâs members received about $4 million in bribes from one company.

There has been wide speculation the case will tar the opposition of current President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, who has termed the case a âhistoricâ step in his fight against corruption.

National Action responded in a statement Wednesday that âEmilio Lozoya is a strategic ally of the president to denigrate the PAN, because it is an alternative to the failureâ of LÃ³pez Obradorâs policies.

âRegarding the leaked testimony, we repeat our stance: if there is compelling evidence, we will take compelling action,â the party stated, a reference to previous promises to expel any member caught in acts of corruption.

Neither Videgaray nor his assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have responded to emails seeking comment. PeÃ±a Nietoâs former chief of staff also did not respond. The Tamaulipas governor, GarcÃ­a Cabeza de Vaca, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Lozoya said PeÃ±a Nieto and Videgaray personally questioned him about a deal to buy an outdated fertilizer plant at an excessive price from one private company, asking him in a meeting at the presidentâs office in 2013 âwhy is it taking so long.â

He said the two were particularly interested in the deal and that Videgaray rushed through a review of the deal and told him not to worry about the price being paid, which ended up being several times the plantâs real value. Lozoya said he was âsurprisedâ by their level of interest in the deal, and said PeÃ±a Nieto and Videgaray negotiated the purchase with the plantâs owner.

âIt was evident that Luis Videgaray Caso had a personal interest in getting the deal done, either because he would obtain some possible illicit benefit, or to pay off favors from the past.â

It was an apparent attempt by Lozoya to shift the blame from himself.

According to charges filed against Lozoya earlier this year, the Mexican firm, Altos Hornos de Mexico, sold the overpriced old fertilizer plant to Pemex after allegedly paying Lozoya around $3.4 million in bribes 2012. According to prosecutors, the money went though accounts controlled by Lozoya and his sister, and they used most of it to buy a house in an upscale neighborhood in the capital.

In the testimony, Lozoya claimed he was âintimidatedâ into signing off on the purchase of the fertilizer plant, known as Agronitrogenados, by the president and Videgaray.

âLuis Videgaray Caso took over leadership of the decisions regarding the purchase of Agronitrogenados, arguing, and I quote âThis is the presidentâs business, you just do what you are told. I speak for him.ââ

Lozoya even suggested the bribery and kickback scheme was meant to finance future campaigns by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which governed Mexico for 70 years in the 20th century and returned to power in 2012 after a 12-year absence.

âSometimes they (businessmen) had to give money back after the deals to benefit future PRI electoral campaigns, or for the personal benefit of Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso,â according to the document.",am
164,"The fallout from a massive bribery scandal that helped to bring down a Brazilian president is spreading across Latin America, threatening to engulf leaders from Panama to Peru.

The workings of a secret âbribery departmentâ at the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht that suborned government officials around the world for years are being exposed by investigators. Meticulous schemes of graft laid out by witnesses, in plea deals and in leaked and seized documents show how the company funnelled $800m (Â£641m) of payouts to politicians and parties in Latin America alone.

As prosecutors chase the trail of that cash, it has led them towards some of the regionâs most prominent figures. Brazilâs president, Michel Temer, was accused in leaked testimony last year of taking campaign funds from Odebrecht, and the Panamanian president, Juan Carlos Varela, was implicated by a man who has himself been arrested in connection with the scandal. Both deny wrongdoing. In Argentina a federal judge is seeking information from Brazil and Switzerland to determine if the head of the spy agency took a $600,000 bribe from Odebrecht, which he also denies.

But perhaps the most surprising accusations came this week, when authorities implicated two men who have based their political careers on a reputation for integrity in countries plagued by graft. Peru sent out an Interpol arrest warrant for its former president Alejandro Toledo, on charges of taking some $20m in bribes. And Colombiaâs chief prosecutor has said the countryâs Nobel peace prize-winning president Juan Manuel Santos may have taken money for his re-election campaign. Both men have strongly denied the charges.

Toledo, who led Peru from 2001 to 2006, rose to power leading protests against the former president Alberto Fujimori, who was later jailed for corruption and human rights abuses. The country is still reeling from the news that Toledo could be joining his old opponent in prison. The front page of the local newspaper El Comercio reproached the former president, who comes from an indigenous family, with a headline quoting a traditional Andean commandment, âAma Sua: do not stealâ.

Authorities who offered a $30,000 reward for Toledoâs capture say he took the money in return for smoothing Odebrechtâs path to a lucrative contract for a road connecting Brazil to Peruâs Pacific coast. They have sought particular help from the US, where Toledo is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, and from Israel. His wife has Israeli citizenship and the country does not have an extradition treaty with Peru, so officials fear he may try to seek refuge there.

Santos has been accused by Colombiaâs chief prosecutor Nestor Martinez of taking up to $1m in campaign donations, based on the testimony of an ex-senator who was jailed for allegedly channelling Odebrecht cash but also has ties to Santosâs opponents. Martinez plans to travel to Brazil this week to look for evidence to support the accusation, Reuters reported. Santos has rejected the allegations, but the case could be particularly damaging to a leader who took a fierce public stance on the unfolding scandal.

He threatened last month that the âfull weight of the lawâ would fall on anyone accused of taking Odebrecht cash, and his government was the first outside Brazil to arrest former officials after the firm admitted a history of corruption in a plea deal with the US justice department. Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5bn in penalties to authorities in Switzerland, the US and Brazil to settle the case. However, many in Latin America and beyond believe that agreement could mark just the beginning of efforts to unravel a complex and entrenched network of corruption. US prosecutors, when they announced the deal, described an extraordinary normalisation of graft within the firm, that suggested few countries where it operated would have been immune.

â[They] used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit â a âDepartment of Briberyâ, so to speak â that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,â said the US deputy assistant attorney general Sung-Hee Suh.

Many more details about the system and the people who benefited from it are thought to be laid out in testimony from former top executives at Odebrecht, nicknamed the âend of the world confessionsâ by local media. They form a key part of plea deals made by 77 senior executives from the company and its former boss Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the founder.

They have not been made public, but few people in Brazil expect their explosive contents to stay secret forever, and a single confession leaked so far implicates the deeply unpopular Temer in taking a multimillion-pound campaign donation from the group.

He denies taking the money, but is now the second Brazilian leader whose future has been jeopardised by the firmâs corruption. It was part of the wider Car Wash scandal that was a major driver in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff last year, although she was ousted for breaking budget laws and has not been personally implicated.

In Panama the unfolding scandal has caught up both the president and his accuser RamÃ³n Fonseca, a former friend and one of the founders of the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal, Fonseca himself was arrested along with his business partner Juergen Mossack as part of an inquiry into his connections with Odebrecht shortly after insisting that Varela had taken campaign money from the group.

âHe [Varela] told me that he had accepted donations from Odebrecht because he could not fight with everyone,â Fonseca said, without giving more details. Varela denied receiving funds and promised to make all donations to his political campaign public.",am

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors filed charges against the countryâs Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating a bribery scheme in 2009 when he was governor of Mato Grosso state.

Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutorâs office.

Maggi denies any wrongdoing, said the press office of the agriculture minister in a written statement.

Under Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision.

Dodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court 12 million reais ($3.4 million) in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.

Almeida was removed from the court last year and faces a trial in a lower-level federal court in connection with the supposed scheme.

Almeida could not be reached for comment.",am
166,"SAN DIEGO Â­â Bing Han and Lei Zhang pleaded guilty in federal court today for operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses. Their guilty pleas are believed to be the first in the United States for a developing form of unlawful underground financial institution that transfers money between the United States and China, thereby circumventing domestic and foreign laws regarding monetary transfers and reporting, including United States anti-money laundering scrutiny and Chinese capital flight controls.

Special Agents from Homeland Security Investigations, IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas Financial Crimes Task Force, and the Drug Enforcement Administration led the investigation into Hanâs and Zhangâs financial operations. As admitted in the plea agreements entered today before U.S. Magistrate Judge William V. Gallo, Han and Zhang would collect U.S. dollars (in cash) from various third-parties in the United States and deliver that cash to a customer, typically a gambler from China who could not readily access cash in the United States due to capital controls that limit the amount of Chinese yuan an individual can convert to foreign currency at $50,000 per year. Upon receipt of the U.S. dollars, the customer (i.e., the gambler) would transfer the equivalent value of yuan (using banking apps on their cell phones in the United States) from the customerâs Chinese bank account to a Chinese bank account designated by defendant Han or Zhang. For facilitating these transactions, Zhang and Han were paid a commission based on the monetary value illegally transferred.

U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. said, âThe United States stands vigilant against the constantly evolving ways in which individuals and organizations seek to operate outside the conventional financial system. Violating United States anti-money laundering laws not only endangers the integrity of the global financial system, but doing so hinders the ability of law enforcement officers to confront criminal conduct including money laundering and narcotics trafficking.â

Han and Zhang further admitted today that they were regularly introduced to customers by casino hosts, who sought to increase the gambling play of the casinoâs customers. By connecting cash-starved gamblers in the United States with illicit money transmitting businesses, like those operated by Han and Zhang, the casinos increased the domestic cash play of their China-based customers. All a gambler needed was a mobile device that had remote access a China-based bank account. As a result, Han and Zhang managed to transmit and convert electronic funds in China into hard currency in the United States; all while circumventing the obstacles imposed both by Chinaâs capital controls, and the anti-money laundering scrutiny imposed on all United States financial institutions. For their efforts, the casino hosts often received a cut of Hanâs or Zhangâs commission.

âThis case demonstrates that those who attempt to use underground or unregulated money transfer systems cannot evade detection and punishment,â said Cardell T. Morant, acting Special Agent in Charge for HSI San Diego. âHSI and our domestic and foreign partners will continue to work together aggressively to investigate and prosecute those who seek to hide their involvement in transnational crime by employing such international money laundering schemes.â

âCriminals keep trying to find ways to circumvent our financial system by laundering money,â said Tara Sullivan, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas. âUnfortunately for Han and Zhang, the IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas Financial Crimes Task Force was relentless in seeking out and disrupting their underground banking network and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to uphold anti-money laundering lawsâ.

âAlthough Mr. Han and Mr. Zhang did not admit to transacting narcotics proceeds in their unlicensed money transmitting businesses, we know that drug trafficking organizations are willing to use a variety of businesses to launder proceeds from the sales of drugs,â said DEA Special Agent in Charge John W. Callery. âDEA and our outstanding partners will continue to investigate illicit financial transactions and anyone who may operate businesses that stand to profit from illegal drug sales.â

U.S. Attorney Brewer commended the diligence and dedication of Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Silva and Mark W. Pletcher, the prosecutors on this case. Sentencing for Mr. Han is scheduled to occur on May 1, 2020 before Hon. Janis L. Sammartino. Sentencing for Mr. Zhang is scheduled to occur on May 4, 2020 before Hon. William Q. Hayes. Han and Zhang both face a maximum of 5 years in prison.

167,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has sanctioned San Antonio broker-dealer Braymen, Lambert and Noel Securities Ltd. and one of its principals.

FINRA, the securities industryâs self-policing organization, censured and fined Braymen, Lambert and Noel Securities, or BLNS, $70,000. FINRA also fined firm partner Shannon Braymen $20,000 and suspended her for a month.

BLNS and Braymen consented to the sanctions without admitting or denying FINRAâs findings.

âI did nothing wrong,â Braymen said in an interview. âNo clients were hurt. No monies were lost. No complaints were filed.â

Neither Braymen nor the firm has any prior formal disciplinary history with FINRA.

FINRA found BLNS failed to actively supervise the firmâs participation in nine private placement offerings from April 2007 to November 2011.

âSpecifically, the firm had no documentation of principal review and approval of any of the offering documents for the nine offerings (and) no documentation that a principal of the firm had conducted due diligence on any of the offerings,â according to a âLetter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consentâ that Braymen submitted to FINRA.

The letter also said the firm lacked customer subscription documents that were required to determine customersâ suitability for the investments.

Braymen said she had been doing business the same way for 13 years before FINRA conducted an audit in November 2011.

âThey said I didnât do secondary due diligence on private placements, which I didnât need to do because the due diligence was already done, and nobody was complaining or losing money.â The analysis had been completed by numerous lawyers and analysts, she added.

âNo red flags were raised, and all of a sudden FINRA says, âYouâre doing it wrong and weâre going to fine you,ââ she said. âI felt blindsided.â

She said a more appropriate response from FINRA would have been âa slap on the hand.â

The private placements involved various medical-related companies. Among them, Braymen said, were cancer drug developer Azaya Therapeutics and medical device manufacturer BiO2 Medical Inc., both of San Antonio.

BLNS also operated two unregistered branch offices in San Antonio and Austin, FINRA said.",am

Casino operator Wynn Resorts has added three women to its board, amid allegations of sexual misconduct by its former chief executive Steve Wynn.

The company said the appointments were a ""first step"" in efforts to refresh and diversify its board.

Shareholders are currently suing Wynn's board over claims it knew of the allegations against Mr Wynn for years and failed to investigate.

Mr Wynn has denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations ""preposterous"".

Wynn Resorts said Betsy Atkins, Dee Dee Myers and Wendy Webb had been appointed as independent directors, effective immediately, bringing its board numbers to 11.

""The Wynn Resorts board now comprises 36% women, bringing Wynn into the top 40 S&P 500 companies in terms of female board representation,"" the company said in a statement.

Ms Myers was the first woman to serve as the White House press secretary, a position she held during President Clinton's first term and is now an executive at Warner Bros.

Ms Webb's background includes some 20 years as a senior executive at The Walt Disney Company, while Betsy Atkins is an expert in corporate governance.

""To be clear, this is the first step in our effort to refresh the board,"" said chairman D Boone Wayson. ""We intend to add additional new directors in the coming months.""

Mr Wynn resigned as head of the firm he co-founded in February after a Wall Street Journal report alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him.

Since his resignation, all his stock in the firm has been sold and he has been removed from all company operations.

He is one of the biggest names in the business world to quit over allegations of sexual misconduct.

169,"U.S. authorities have successfully prosecuted an illegal Las Vegas money transfer scheme that used a method similar to one in B.C.

Canadian authorities have been criticized for their tepid money-laundering prosecution record, including in late 2017 when a major money-laundering case collapsed in British Columbia.

article continues below

It used the same method cited in the Las Vegas case. That method â where cash is given gamblers in exchange for money in a Chinese bank â had been dubbed the âVancouver modelâ by an Australian academic.

On Feb. 3, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of California announced that Bing Han and Lei Zhang pleaded guilty in Federal Court for operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses.

The pair face a maximum five years in prison.

In statement, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office said the guilty pleas are believed to be the first in the U.S. for a form of unlawful underground banking that transfers money between the U.S. and China that circumvents domestic and foreign laws. Chinese citizens are only allowed to transfer US$50,000 a year out of that country.

B.C. Attorney General David Eby, who has been a critic of Canadaâs money-laundering prosecutions, said the similarities in the Las Vegas and Vancouver cases and their different prosecution outcomes are striking. âAmericans seem to be more than willing to use their tax system and their anti-money-laundering system to support aggressive prosecutions, and Canadians simply donât,â Eby said.

Eby has been pushing the Trudeau government for a boost in investigations and prosecution capacity, which he says has not materialized .

Queenâs University law professor Arthur Cockfield said that Canada has some successful prosecutions for international money laundering but most of them collapse.

âItâs a real problem,â he said.

It is complex to prosecute money laundering, but this American prosecution shows it is feasible, said Cockfield.

Garry Clement, a former RCMP superintendent who served as national director of the proceeds of crime program, said it is disheartening that prosecutions are possible in the U.S. but not in Canada.

Clement said what is needed is both legislative changes to strengthen Canadian laws against money laundering and more policing resources and expertise.

The investigation into Han and Zhangâs financial operation included special agents from Homeland Security investigations, the Internal Revenue Serviceâs Las Vegas financial crimes task force and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The money laundering scheme described in Las Vegas is very similar to the model described by RCMP in court documents of the E-Pirate investigation that alleged an illicit money transfer business in Richmond laundered as much as $220 million in drug trafficking money.

Cash was provided to high stakes gamblers who used it in Lower Mainland casinos. The gamblers in turn deposited Chinese currency in Chinese banks to pay for the cash.

Those involved in the illicit money-transfer business took a cut of the transfers, similar to the cut taken by the Las Vegas money transferers, according to the plea agreement filed in U.S. court.

Han, for example, received a five per cent fee.

According to the plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court, Han collected U.S. dollars in cash and delivered the cash to gamblers from China.

The gambler would transfer an equivalent value of currency from the gamblersâ Chinese bank to an account designated by Han.",am

172,"How corrupt is Penny Pritzker, Obamaâs latest cabinet appointee?

I mean that question literally. I donât think we know the degree to which she is corrupt. Iâm going to quote Rick Perlstein at The Nation, in part 1 of a two-part report (psst: watch for part 2).

Perlstein is the king of research. Penny Pritzker and her family are queens of the privately held, union-hating Hyatt Hotel chain.

Pay attention, kids (my emphasis and some reparagraphing):

Penny Pritzkerâs Commerce (Part One)

In December of 2008, Obamaâs choice for Secretary of Commerce, Chicago-based business tycoon Penny Pritzker, withdrew her name from consideration in the face of a triple-barreled onslaught.

First, there was her position on the board of Superior Bank, which her family bought with the help of $645 million in tax credits for the federal government. In 2001, Superior collapsed after pioneering the bottom-feeding trade in subprime mortgages. In In These Times, David Moberg called it a âmini-Enron scandalâ; 1,406 uninsured depositors lost their savings.

Here was what one of the victims had to say: â The Pritzkers are crooks. They donât care anything about people who spent their whole lives trying to save.â And here is how Penny responded: âWe had seven years of clean audits and then the auditors said, âWell, maybe weâll change the way we calculate.â â Exquisite humanity, that.

The family coughed up $435 million in settlement money in exchange for not having to admit any wrongdoing. But why, Penny was asked, would they pay half a billion dollars to clean up a mess she said was none of their fault? Because, she answered, âMy family is not going to litigate with the federal government at a time like thisââa reference to the September 11 attacks; classy.

Here was the second concern which kept her from the Commerce Department in 2008: âWhether she could disentangle herself,â as The Washington Post put it, from her familyâs âvast financial holdingsââmany of which they would prefer not to see scrutinized in public. How vast? Well, way back in 1973, The New York Times reported of âThe Very Private Pritzkers,â âThe family law firm, Pritzker & Prizker, hasnât accepted an outside client for thirty years because of the potential conflict of interest with the Pritzker enterprises, which are too numerous for any one member of the family to recall at any given moment.â

In 1982, when the list became public for the very first timeâmore on why laterâthe holdings included at least 216 separate corporate entities, from mining to motels. One current holding is TransUnionâPenny is chairman of the boardâwhich is one of three companies controlling the creepy trade in credit reports. âAfter widespread consumer complaints about shoddy service in the credit checking industry,â Bloomberg reported back in 2008, âthe US Congress passed legislation in 2003 that allowed people to obtain free copies of credit reports so they could check for mistakes and block information obtained from identity theft.

That same year, a jury awarded Judy Thomas of Klamath Falls, Oregon, $5.3 million after she claimed TransUnion took six years to correct a mistake in her credit report.â Pennyâs reaction? Public-spirited as ever: âThe company has always encouraged consumers to monitor their reports, Pritzker says.

â The third reason Obama chose not to risk political capital on a Penny Pritzker nomination fight is that unions despise her.

And that just gets you started. This is truly a must-read. Perlstein marshals his facts, and his writing is as clear and accessible as it always is. Do click through. Pritzker is an Obama campaign-funds bundler, by the way. Do you smell a motive for nomination?

Perlstein closes:

If Republican senators have any strategic sense, theyâll be asking in open hearings about this sort of stuff: how the Pritzkers came by all those billions in the first place, how theyâve kept it from the view of the public and the taxman both, and what it is theyâve been so eager to hide. Iâll have more to say about that tomorrow.

To put it lightly: Itâs not the kind of thing Barack Obama needs America to hear about one of his cabinet appointees.

Letâs just see if (a) Senate Republicans are so p-ed at Barack Obama that they 60-vote Penny Pritzker, or (b) Senate Republicans give a bye to Penny Pritzker, one of their own.

Why does Leona Helmsley come to mind? Dunno.

33-year-old Nosa Onaghise was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison for his role in a conspiracy that laundered more than $1.7 million in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scam proceeds stolen from multiple companies. He must also pay $1,639,419.57 in restitution, pay a $230,000 money judgment, forfeit $14,282.50 seized from a bank account, and be placed on supervised release for three years.

In a BEC scheme, scammers target businesses and individuals making wire transfer payments, often targeting employees with access to company finances, says the US Attorneyâs office. The scammers trick the employees into making wire transfer payments to bank accounts thought to belong to trusted partners-except the money ends up in accounts controlled by the fraudsters.

Sometimes the scammers use computer intrusion techniques to alter legitimate payment request emails, changing the recipient bank accounts, according to the US Attorneyâs office. Sometimes they send spoofed emails from email addresses similar to the real email accounts used by trusted partners.

In 2018, Onaghise pleaded guilty to one count of passport fraud admitting to attempting to use a false, forged, or counterfeit passport to open several bank accounts in the U.S. in furtherance of the fraud scheme.

Last December, Onaghiseâs co-defendant Joseph Odibobhahemen, a 28-year-old Nigerian citizen formerly residing in Austin, was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison for his role in the fraud scheme.

Court records show that between November 2016 and April 2019, over $10 million was allegedly sent by victims to accounts controlled by the conspirators, who were able to take in excess of $6 million before law enforcement or financial institutions stopped the fraudulent transfers.

Onaghise, Odibobhahemen, and four other co-conspirators acquired or controlled dozens of bank accounts in the U.S., including in Austin, using fraudulent IDs, including fraudulent foreign passports in fake names, says the US Attorneyâs office. Once the funds were fraudulently procured and deposited into these bogus accounts, the defendants worked quickly to withdraw or transfer the funds.

174,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six individuals and four entities linked to the Brothersâ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Todayâs actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothersâ Circle in February 2012. Todayâs designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasuryâs efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.

âThe key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothersâ Circle, is exposing the network behind the groupâs leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,â said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Brothersâ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Todayâs action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothersâ Circle.

The Brothersâ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothersâ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Todayâs action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Targets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev

Vladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothersâ Circle.

He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Grigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Igor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyevâs behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Targets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov

In February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothersâ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothersâ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.

Artur Badalyan

Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothersâ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.

175,"Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Leslie R. Caldwell, and FBI Director Robert Mueller announced today that Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer (CFO) of Enron Corporation, has pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud and is cooperating with an ongoing criminal investigation into Enron's collapse.
Fastow, the highest-level defendant to be charged to date in the Enron investigation, entered his plea today before Judge Kenneth Hoyt at U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Under the terms of a plea agreement, Fastow will cooperate fully with the government's investigation, serve a 10-year prison sentence on the two counts to which he's pleading guilty, and forfeit more than $29 million. The remaining 96 criminal charges against Fastow from a May 2003 indictment are pending, and will be dismissed if the government determines that Fastow has cooperated fully and truthfully.
In addition, former Enron Assistant Treasurer Lea W. Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, has agreed to plead guilty to filing a false joint tax return for 2000, in which she failed to report income from a partnership related to Enron. She is expected to enter the guilty plea before Judge David Hittner at federal court in Houston later today.
""As one of the masterminds behind a massive fraud scheme, Andrew Fastow constructed an elaborate wall of deceitâshielding the reality of Enron's failing business from the watchful eye of shareholders and the investing public,"" said Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, the head of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force. ""Today's plea tears that wall down. Using Mr. Fastow's cooperation, we will continue to tear the wall down by prosecuting each person to which the evidence and the law leads us.""
""The Andrew Fastow plea and cooperation agreement opens wide a window into the fraudulent practices of Enron's senior management,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray. ""Fastow's prison sentence demonstrates once again that we will uncover fraudulent conduct by corporate officials, and the consequences will be serious.""
FBI Director Robert Mueller said, ""Today's plea agreements are a significant milestone in an intensive two-year investigation. The FBI and our partners on the Enron Task Force will continue our efforts to uncover the full extent of criminal conduct that contributed to Enron's collapse. Corporate criminals should be on notice that no matter how complex or intricate their schemes, they are going to be held accountable for their actions.""

""The forfeiture of more than $29 million in personal assets by the Fastows, a sum only a few Americans will earn in their lifetime, speaks to the magnitude of their criminal activities,"" stated Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark W. Everson. ""Our investigation substantiated that the Fastows filed multiple false tax returns, and, through her plea agreement announced today, Mrs. Fastow, an MBA and former assistant treasurer at Enron, acknowledges the Fastows' willful criminal conduct.""
Andrew Fastow Pleads Guilty; Agrees to Serve 10 Years in Prison
Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371. The charges carry a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. As part of his plea agreement, Fastow agreed to serve 10 years in prison and to cooperate fully with the government's ongoing criminal investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation.
As part of the plea agreement, Fastow admitted that he and other members of Enron's senior management conspired in wide-ranging schemes to fraudulently manipulate Enron's publicly reported financial results. Fastow also admitted participating in schemes to enrich himself at the expense of the company and its shareholders. Specifically, Fastow admitted that he conspired with senior management to cause Enron to enter into improper transactions with the LJM entities, which were under Fastow's control. And he admitted to engaging in self-dealing transactions to enrich himself and others in connection with the so-called Southampton transaction which involved the $30 million buyout by Enron of an entity called LJM Swap Sub, LP, which Fastow controlled. In engaging in these transactions, Mr. Fastow admitted that he violated his duty of loyalty and honest services to Enron's shareholders.
Fastow's sentencing is scheduled for April 19, 2004.
Lea Fastow to Plead Guilty; Agrees to Serve Five Months in Prison
Lea W. Fastow is scheduled to enter her guilty plea today before Judge David Hittner of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas. Under the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, Fastow faces an estimated range of imprisonment of 10 to 16 months. The parties have agreed to recommend to the court a sentence at the low end of this range, which would allow the court to impose a ""split"" sentence of five months incarceration and five months of home confinement as a condition of supervised release.
As part of her plea agreement, Fastow admitted that from December 1997 through 2000, she failed to report as income a total of $204,444.34 in proceeds that her family received from an Enron ""special purpose entity"" known as RADR. Fastow admitted that she knew that this money was derived from RADR and that her husband had been prohibited from investing in RADR. To hide the fact that it was taxable income, the money was disguised as ""gifts"" to the Fastow family, through checks made payable to Fastow, her husband Andrew and their children. To avoid triggering the law's requirement that gifts in excess of $10,000 to another person be reported to the Internal Revenue Service, most of these checks were made payable in amounts of $10,000 or less and in the names of different members of the Fastow family. Although she knew that the payments represented income that should have been reported on their joint federal income tax returns, Fastow concealed the income from the Fastows' accountant and intentionally failed to report the income on their joint federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Fastow admitted that she signed these income tax returns under penalty of perjury and caused them to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
Fastow faces sentencing at a date to be determined.
Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.
The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.
Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. With today's pleas, seven people and Arthur Andersen LLP have been convicted as a result of the ongoing investigation. In addition, the Enron Task Force has restrained more than $93 million in proceeds derived from criminal activity. The Task Force investigation is continuing.",am

After 9/11 the US had imposed sanctions on Akida Islamic Bank which were lifted later.

One of the companies belongs to Obaid Altaf Khanani whose father Altaf Khanani is imprisoned in the US on money laundering charges. Altaf Khanani was arrested in Pakistan in 2009 but was released by the court. His name was placed on the Exit Control List but despite this he fled to Dubai. He was later arrested in the US following an agreement between the US and UAE.

Akida Islamic Bank is also registered as an offshore company in the Bahamas. Former Jamaat-e-Islami Senator Professor Khurshid Ahmed is among its directors. When contacted Professor Ahmed said he had been the director of the bank but did not own any financial stake. He added that the head of Akida Islamic Bank Ahmed Nasreddin was an old friend, adding that he had not even received advisory fees from the bank. The former senator added that US had imposed sanctions on Akida Bank but these were lifted in 2007.",am

Zimbabwe's vice-president says she is taking legal action against state-owned media for linking her to an alleged plot to kill President Robert Mugabe.

Joyce Mujuru said she had ordered her lawyers to restore her ""political standing"" after being falsely accused of treason and corruption.

The Sunday Mail newspaper reported that a hit-man had planned to kill Mr Mugabe so that Mrs Mujuru could take power.

Last month, Mr Mugabe, 90, said he did not plan to step down.

He has governed Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.

'Demonic'

Mr Mugabe and Mrs Mujuru were once close comrades, but have now fallen out as a succession war rages in the ruling Zanu-PF party ahead of its elective congress next month, says the BBC's Brian Hungwe in the capital, Harare.

Mr Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe has recently led a sustained public campaign against Mrs Mujuru, calling on her to resign.

image copyrightAP

She has accused the vice-president of being ""demonic"" and divisive"", and extorting money from companies, the AFP news agency reports.

Mrs Mujuru's statement, denying she is plotting against Mr Mugabe, is unprecedented, our reporter says.

Although she does not give any indication that she plans to quit, she is under intense pressure and has few options, he adds.

The Sunday Mail made the sensational claim that top government officials linked to Mrs Mujuru sought to hire a hit-man to assassinate Mr Mugabe in order to open the way for her to become president, he adds.

""I deny any and all allegations of treason, corruption, incompetence and misuse of public office being routinely made against me in The Herald and The Sunday Mail newspapers,"" Mrs Mujuru said in a statement.

She had asked her lawyers to take the ""necessary steps at law to restore my good reputation, political standing and dignity"", she said.

'Spill Blood'

Mrs Mujuru and Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who in the past controlled the secret police and military, are seen as the leading contenders to succeed Mr Mugabe.

Mrs Mugabe's surprise entry into politics this year, and her nomination to lead Zanu-PF's women's wing, has also fuelled speculation that she could be planning to take over from her husband.

Last month, Mr Mugabe said he did not plan to step aside for young politicians who did not appreciate his role in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

Mrs Mujuru took part in the 1970s guerrilla war against white-minority rule, led by Mr Mugabe.

Her nom de guerre was Teurai Ropa (Spill Blood).

She married Solomon Mujuru, the former army chief seen as Zimbabwe's king-maker in 1977.",am
178,"New Netflix series Trial By Media is taking a hard look at âsome of the most dramatic and memorable trials in recent historyâ through the lens of the idea that âcourtroom dramas have increasingly been transformed into a form of entertainment.â

One such trial is that of Richard Scrushy, aka âKing Richard,â the former CEO of HealthSouth Corporation, an Alabama-based global healthcare company. Hereâs what you need to know about his corruption trial and what heâs doing now.

Richard Scrushy Today

On Scrushyâs personal website, he bills himself as a âspeaker, businessman, entrepreneurâ and he is available to hire for speaking engagements. It also says he and wife Leslie have nine children and six grandchildren, and that he is âa commercial instrument multiengine pilot, an author, a musician, and a songwriter.â

In a 2014 interview with CBS 42 WIAT, Scrushy said of his time in prison, âIt was kind of like growing up in a very austere situation â¦ we had a lot of time on our hands.â He said he spent that time teaching in the prisonâs education program and grew in his faith.

Scrushy Underwent Two Criminal Trials

Trial by Media | Official Trailer | NetflixFrom Executive Producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov, six televised cases defined by headlines reaching across different areas of the law including the unforgettable Jenny Jones made-for-Court TV murder trials, the sensational story of Rod Blagojevichâs political fall, and the case of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was shot 41 times by policeâ¦2020-05-01T14:00:00Z

In 2004, Scrushy was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a lengthy FBI investigation into his accounting fraud that involved $2.7 billion over the course of six years, from 1996 to 2002, according to USA Today.

The SEC originally brought 85 counts of various fraud charges against him, with 36 making it all the way to trial. He was the first CEO charged with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is an act âAn Act To protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws, and for other purposes.â It also protects whistleblowers.

Scrushy was acquitted of all charges during his Birmingham jury trial in 2005. However, four months later, Scrushy was indicted by a federal grand jury alongside former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on 30 counts of bribery, extortion, money laundering, obstruction, and racketeering. In 2006, both men were convicted.

According to the New York Times, the jurors convicted Scrushy of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, the last of which carries the longest jail term. In June 2007, Scrushy was sentenced to six years, 10 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $267,000 in restitution to United Way of Alabama, a fine of $150,000, and was put on three yearsâ probation. Siegelman earned a similar sentence but his sentence was one year longer.

However, in 2009, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court upheld Scrushyâs charges but dismissed two of the seven against Siegelman.

On July 26, 2012, Scrushy was released from federal custody. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller, who presided over the 2006 trial, trimmed Scrushy sentence by a year due to his ministry work while in prison and Scrushyâs plea about being separated from his family, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.

But Scrushy also faced a civil suit from former HealthSouth investors seeking compensation for their money lost due to Scrushyâs fraud. In June 2009, Judge Allwin Horn ordered Scrushy to pay $2.87 billion in restitution. According to Alabama.com, Scrushyâs net worth was divulged over the course of the trial; it was at least $287 million in 2004. Scrushy appealed that verdict but lost his appeal.",am
179,"Dragomir Vasic in a campaign video for last yearâs elections in Bosnia.

The Bosnian state court on Thursday confirmed the indictment of Bosnian Serb lawmaker Vasic and two other former police officials from Zvornik for taking part in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995.

Vasic was the commander of the Zvornik police headquarters and chief of the Public Security Center in the town in the summer of 1995, when Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 7,000men and boys and forcibly removed 40,000 civilians from Srebrenica.

He was elected to the Republika Srpska Peopleâs Assembly in last Octoberâs general elections as a candidate of the Serb Democratic Party founded by Radovan Karadzic, who is on trial in The Hague for genocide in Srebrenica and other crimes during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The indictment against Vasic also charges Danilo Zoljic and Radomir Pantic, former commander of Special Police Units in Zvornik and former commander of the first platoon of the Special Police Units respectively, with genocide in Srebrenica.

Vasic is charged with participating in a criminal enterprise, while Zoljic and Pantic are accused of aiding and abetting the genocide.

All three defendants have been charged with taking part in the planning and realisation of the genocide by ordering the use of manpower and police equipment for the capture and forcible separation of Bosniak men and boys after the fall of the UN-protected Srebrenica enclave to Serb forces in July 1995.

âThe defendants participated in planning and carrying out the arrest of prisoners, their transportation to sites of mass execution, as well as carrying out the executions of several thousand Bosniak men at Kozluk, Branjevo, Pilica and other places,â the indictment says.

The prosecution also charges them with burying the victims in mass graves and with exhuming and removing the bodies to secondary mass graves in order to conceal the crime.

When Vasic testified in a trial at the Hague Tribunal in 2009, he said that on the evening of July 13, 1995, he met Ljubisa Beara, the security chief of the Bosnian Serb Army Main Staff, who told him that his military commander Ratko Mladic had ordered that âall prisoners [from Srebrenica] be killedâ.

The Tribunal sentenced Beara to life imprisonment for the Srebrenica genocide but an appeal is currently under way. Mladic is also on trial for genocide and other crimes.

Maksida Piric, the spokesperson for the Bosnian Electoral Commission, told local media on Thursday that despite the indictment, there is no legal way to take away Vasicâs mandate.

She explained that only people who are serving sentences or are wanted under warrants can be denied mandates according to electoral law.",am

The Ohio House expelled its Republican speaker in a unanimous, bipartisan vote after he was charged in connection with a $60 million bribery scheme.

Rep. Larry Householder and four others were arrested on July 21 and charged as part of a racketeering and bribery probe that investigators called âthe largest bribery, money-laundering scheme against the people of the state of Ohio.â

According to local news reports, Householder has not spoken publicly about the case.

The arrests were part of a yearlong investigation into public corruption and bribery tied to legislation that bailed out two nuclear power plants in the state. The former speaker and his associates are accused of accepting corporate money for personal and political use to pass House Bill 6 to financially bail out two FirstEnergy nuclear plants with over $1 billion.

Householder was a key player in the legislation, which added a fee to every electric bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.

âThis is the most important thing that weâve done today,"" said GOP Rep. Bob Cupp, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice who is a potential candidate to be the next speaker. ""There is no doubt that people feel betrayed, used, and it's been a stain on the House, and people want to make sure we begin anew.â

Householder is the first Ohio House Speaker ever removed by the chamber.

Remaining members of Householderâs leadership team have said he deserves the presumption of innocence but âlost the trust of his colleagues and the publicâ and couldnât effectively lead the House. Householder had been asked to step down by colleagues in both parties but refused.

Householder, former Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth could all face up to 20 years in prison if convicted for their alleged work to pass the bailout and block attempts to overturn it, according to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI.

Borgesâ lawyer Karl Schneider said his clientâs involvement in the case has been âwildly overstated.â

Householder had been speaker since 2019 after previously having the position from 2001 to 2004. He left office due to term limits but rejoined the House in 2017. He was seen as one of the most powerful and influential state lawmakers in Ohio.

Previous attempts to bail out the nuclear plants had stalled in the legislature before Householder became speaker. Months after taking over, he rolled out a new plan to subsidize the plants and eliminate renewable energy incentives. The proposal was approved a year ago despite opposition from many business leaders and the manufacturing industry.

This is also not the first time Householder has been investigated for questionable practices.

At the time he left office, he and several top advisers were under federal investigation for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government closed the case without filing charges.

Householder is the second Ohio House speaker to come under investigation in just over two years.

Former Republican Speaker Cliff Rosenberger was investigated in 2018 amid an FBI inquiry into his travel, lavish lifestyle and a condo he rented from a wealthy GOP donor. Rosenberger, who has maintained he broke no laws, has not been charged, but the investigation remains open.",am
181,"Computer antivirus pioneer John McAfee tweeted last year that he hadn't filed a tax return in eight years.

It was OK, he explained. He was ""done making money."" His ""net income is negative.""

""Taxation is illegal,"" he said.

Now McAfee has been arrested in Spain on tax evasion charges. The U.S. Justice Department has accused him of failing to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018 despite making millions, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.

He is accused of making money from ""promoting crypto-currencies, consulting work, speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary."" His extradition to the U.S. is pending, according to the Justice Department.

Prosecutors said he evaded taxes by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts set up in others' names, according to the indictment. He also allegedly concealed assets, including real property, a vehicle and a yacht, by putting them in other people's names.

I have not filed a tax return for 8 years. Why? 1: taxation is illegal. 2: I paid tens of millions already and received Jack Shit in services. 3. I'm done making money. I live off of cash from McAfee Inc. My net income is negative. But i am a prime target for the IRS. Here I am.

â John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 3, 2019

He could face up to 30 years in prison and $1.75 million in fines if convicted.

McAfee was once a prominent figure in the software sector.

He founded McAfee LLC, which Intel bought for $7.68 billion in 2010. The company was not cited in the indictment.

But in recent years, he's made international headlines for other reasons: his involvement in a murder investigation in Belize, a failed presidential bid, deportation from Guatemala, and his detention in the Dominican Republic, to name a few.

In 2012, he abandoned his residence in Belize after his neighbor, Gregory Faull, was killed. He fled to Guatemala after being made a person of interest â not a suspect â in the case and said he feared for his life.

He reportedly was in Belize in the first place to lower his taxes.

Eventually, his location in Guatemala was revealed through the metadata of a photo posted by Vice Magazine online. He was arrested over entering the country illegally and was deported back to the United States.

Then, last year, a U.S. District Court ordered McAfee to pay $25 million in a wrongful death lawsuit in Faull's death, according to the Florida Record.

McAfee said he would not pay and he was ""never suspected of murder"" in a statement he posted to Twitter in March 2019.

""I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits for the past 11 years. They have all been frivolous,"" he wrote, calling the order ""the legal extortion game aimed at America's wealthy class.""

He claimed to have ""no assets"" and said he couldn't pay, even if a lawsuit demanded it.

On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York against McAfee.

The complaint claimed McAfee ""leveraged his fame"" to make more than $23 million wrongfully from 2017 to 2018.

McAfee is accused of recommending initial coin offerings of cryptocurrency to his Twitter followers without disclosing he was being paid. Instead, he passed it off as unbiased investment advice.

At the time of this writing he has 1 million Twitter followers.

Amid his international escapades, McAfee also made a foray into U.S. politics. He had two bids for U.S. president, first in 2016 and briefly again in 2020.

After originally floating the idea of creating his own party, called the Cyber Party, he ran both times as a Libertarian. He failed to secure the party's nomination either time.

A Twitter account bearing his wife's name, Janice McAfee, posted a statement Tuesday defending her husband (and noting that both her and her husband's accounts are ""staffed by interns."") Her statement, retweeted by John McAfee's account, said a team of lawyers are working to assist him.

""Regardless of whatever John may or may not have done,"" Janice McAfee said, ""he has spent most of his retirement fighting not only for his own freedom, but everyone's freedom.""",am
182,"Colombiaâs Supreme Court on Friday called President Juan Manuel Santos and 18 of his (former) ministers to testify over a bribery scandal involving Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht.

The request was made by the defense attorney of Senator Bernardo Miguel Elias (U Party), who was arrested by prosecution officials on Thursday for allegedly receiving $9 million in bribes.

(Former) ministers called to testify

German Vargas (former vice-president)
Mauricio Cardenas (finance minister)
Maria Angela Holguin (foreign minister)
Aurelio Iragorri (agriculture minister)
Mariana Garces (culture minister)
Alejandro Gaviria (health minister)
Juan Fernando Cristo (former interior minister)
Tomas Gonzalez (former mining minister)
Gina Parody (former education minister)
Juan Carlos Pinzon (former defense minister)
Luis Felipe Henao (former housing minister)
Yesid Reyes (former justice minister)
Luis Eduardo Garzon (former labor minister)
Natalia Abello (former transport minister)
Cecilia Alvarez (former trade minister)
Gabriel Vallejo (former environment minister)
Diego Molano (former technology minister)
Simon Gaviria (National Planning Department director)

The senatorâs defense had asked the court to call all witnesses of the act that granted Odebrecht a major road construction project to testify.

The presidentâs successful 2010 and 2014 election campaigns were already under investigation for allegedly allowing illegal Odebrecht contributions to finance Santosâ political ambitions.

However, with the calling to testify of 18 (former) executives, the scandal has reached not just Santosâ electoral machine, but the highest echelons of power in the country.

Mutually beneficial alliance becomes mutually destructive

The move appears to be an act of revenge of the senator who was long one of Santosâ key power brokers in the Pacific region, but fell out of presidential grace after being linked to the $27 million bribery scandal.

While far from Colombiaâs largest corruption scandal since Santos took office, the bribery investigation has already spurred the withdrawal of opposition presidential candidate Oscar Ivan Zuluaga (Democratic Center) and has, more importantly, spurred a public apology by Santos.

The senator in the corner

According to a leaked testimony by jailed former Congressman Otto Bulla, Elias would have received $9 million while another $4.5 million in bribes was reserved for âother politicians managed by Federicoâ Gaviria, a businessman also in jail for his alleged corruption.

The evidence and testimonies presented by the prosecution indicate that the office is seeking to turn Elias into a state witness, which in turn could lead to the arrest of more sitting congressmen at little more than half a year before national elections.

Colombiaâs prosecution opened a criminal investigation after the United States Department of Justice revealed that Odebrecht allegedly had spent more than $11 million in bribes to obtain road infrastructure contracts in Colombia.

This, however, appeared to be a low estimate after claims by Colombiaâs Prosecutor General that the Brazilian company had bribed government and elected officials for $27 million.",am
183,"WASHINGTONâDiego Montoya Sanchez, 48, one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Colombian drug cartel and a former FBI Top Ten Fugitive, pleaded guilty today in Miami to drug trafficking, murder, and racketeering charges, the Justice Department announced.

Montoya Sanchez appeared before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga in Miami, where he pleaded guilty in two pending federal cases. In the first case, which was indicted in the Southern District of Florida by the U.S. Attorney's Office, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder.

In the second case, which was indicted in the District of Columbia jointly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the Criminal Division's Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS), Montoya Sanchez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for the guilty plea.

Following the decline of the Cali Cartel in the mid-1990s, the Norte Valle Cartel emerged to become Colombia's most prolific cocaine trafficking cartel. Based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. According to the SDNY/NDDS indictment, between 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States.

According to the statement of facts submitted in conjunction with today's hearing, Montoya Sanchez was a high-level Colombian drug trafficker for more than two decades. In the mid-1980s, Montoya Sanchez ran cocaine laboratories that served many significant traffickers. In the late 1980s, Montoya Sanchez expanded his organization's operations into smuggling plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. According to the statement of facts, by the early 1990s, Montoya Sanchez had switched to maritime smuggling. During the course of the next 15 years, Montoya Sanchez's organization routinely smuggled cocaine loads between 1,000 and 6,000 kilos at a time using go-fast boats and fishing boats, among other methods.

By the late 1990s, Montoya Sanchez and Wilber Varela emerged to become the Norte Valle Cartel's two leading kingpins. Mounting tensions between the Montoya and Varela organizations led to a two-year war between the organizations in which each targeted the other's members for murder. The Montoya-Varela war, which lasted from fall 2003 until fall 2005, resulted in hundreds of deaths, including those of innocent civilians.

At today's hearing, Montoya Sanchez admitted that his organization's practices included using violence and murder against people his organization feared were cooperating with law enforcement. Montoya Sanchez specifically admitted to the August 2003 murder of a one-time organization member who was believed to have been cooperating with authorities.

In May 2004, the FBI added Montoya Sanchez to its list of ten most wanted fugitives. On Sept. 10, 2007, Colombian authorities mounted an operation on a believed Montoya hide-out at a ranch in a rural area outside of Zarzal, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, and captured Montoya Sanchez hiding in a creek-bed approximately 700 yards from the ranch. Montoya Sanchez was extradited from Colombia to Miami on Dec. 12, 2008.

Jeffrey H. Sloman, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, stated, ""From the prosecution and conviction of the leaders of the Cali Cartel, to the conviction of Ze'ev Rosenstein and an Israel-based Ecstasy network, to today's dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel, the Southern District of Florida has had a long and successful history in the war on drugs. We will continue to focus our energy, and the expertise of our prosecutors, to help our law enforcement partners stem the tide of drugs flooding our streets and poisoning our society.""

""Diego Montoya Sanchez was the leader of a dangerous, violent drug organization,"" said Thomas J. Harrington, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI. ""Outstanding cooperation between Colombia and the United States was key to his capture, the capture of others, and the effective dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel. The FBI and its law enforcement partners, both here and overseas, will continue to work together to eliminate other international organized crime threats.""

""The prosecution of Montoya Sanchez is a milestone in the efforts to dismantle the Norte Valle Cartel, one of the world's most powerful and dangerous drug-trafficking cartels,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York. ""Montoya Sanchez's arrest and extradition marked the end of his long campaign of violence and corruption. We are grateful to our partners at the DEA and in the Colombian government for their tireless work in this investigation.""

""Montoya Sanchez's path to the top of the Norte Valle Cartel was marked by decades of extreme violence. That path has now ended in a prison cell, where the man who personally helped direct multi-ton shipments of addictive and destructive narcotics into American cities and towns will be held for his crimes,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. ""This conviction is a major victory in the joint effort by Colombia and the United States to disrupt and dismantle these drug trafficking organizations, made possible through extensive cooperation with our partners in the Southern District of Florida, the Southern District of New York, the DEA and the FBI.""

""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" said Acting DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""Due to the skilled and brave work by the men and women of DEA and the Colombian National Police, justice has been served for the many victims of his cartel's extreme violence and the tons of cocaine that ended up on American streets. Now he is in prison, no longer able to use his power to destroy others or benefit from his ill-gotten gains.""

Montoya Sanchez is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the case out of the Southern District of Florida. In January 2009, Montoya Sanchez's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder and was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, Montoya Sanchez's brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States. They were sentenced to terms of 262 and 235 months in prison, respectively.

According to in-court statements during the hearing, Diego Montoya Sanchez agreed to serve a 45-year prison term for the crimes outlined in the court documents. Sentencing has been scheduled for Oct. 21, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. before Judge Altonaga.

The Southern District of Florida indictment is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office and was investigated by the FBI. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was the result of a multi-district investigation and is being prosecuted jointly by SDNY and NDDS, and was investigated by the DEA. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs and NDDS Judicial AttachÃ©s in Bogota, Colombia provided significant assistance in both cases. U.S. law enforcement received invaluable assistance in its prosecution of Diego Montoya Sanchez from the Government of Colombia, the Colombian National Police and the Colombian Army.",am
184,"Millionaire Anglo-American software pioneer John David McAfee has been arrested and charged with failing to pay taxes for a period of four years.

An indictment was unsealed yesterday by the United States Department of Justice that charges the 75-year-old with tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns.

According to the indictment, the Roanoke College graduate earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story to documentary-makers.

But the DOJ alleges that McAfee allegedly failed to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018, ""despite receiving considerable income from these sources.""

It is alleged that the man who founded multiple companies, including Tribal Voice, QuorumEx, and Future Tense, evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.

The indictment further alleges McAfee attempted to evade America's Internal Revenue Service by placing assets he owned in the names of other people. Among the assets he is accused of concealing are real estate property, a vehicle, and a yacht.

The indictment was unsealed after the British-born resident of Lexington, Tennessee, was arrested in Spain, where he is currently awaiting extradition.

The charges were announced shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had brought civil charges against McAfee.

The government regulator alleges that between 2017 and 2018, McAfee leveraged his fame to recommend seven cryptocurrency offerings that turned out to be ""essentially worthless."" However, McAfee allegedly neglected to disclose that he had been paid over $23m to do so.

In 2019, McAfee tweeted that he hadn't filed tax returns for 8 years because ""taxation is illegal."" If convicted in both cases, the entrepreneur could be imprisoned for a maximum of 35 years.

Charges have also been brought by the SEC against McAfee's bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, who allegedly aided and abetted the sale of digital currencies.

McAfee founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company.

The indictment does not allege that McAfee received any income or had any connection with the anti-virus company bearing his name during the period when he allegedly failed to pay taxes.",am
185,"VANCOUVER â Founding Zimbabwe President, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, was reportedly toppled from power and had his life prematurely ended by a close but false family ârelativeâ who is extremely deeply involved with the occult, Spotlight Zimbabwe, has reported.

The suspicious rogue relative according to a disgruntled Mugabe family member who declined to be named, due to the sensitivity of the matter, is a well known dubious businessman in Harare, with questionable business interests in real estate, agriculture, and sports, including a stint in football management.

The Mugabe family member, currently residing outside the country said, the countryâs former president was sacrificed as a blood offering or ritual by this fake and imposter relative, who is said to be practicing satanism in broad day light.

âPresident Robert Mugabe, was not removed from power through a mere coup as we all believe,â said the Mugabe family member currently pursuing business in South Africa and here in Canada.

âAll I can say is that our president was dethroned from office through satanic means, by people we trusted and loved and regarded as relatives to the family. The particular person involved and really responsible for the 2017 coup that removed president Mugabe from office, is a man who organised the official visit of a world pop-star in Zimbabwe.â

The hurting Mugabe family member, who is back home in Harare to attend to a Mugabe remembrance ceremony, said the rogue relative who masterminded Mugabeâs political downfall and death is also allegedly responsible for the death of pioneering local business mogul, Peter Pamire, who died in a freak car accident in 1997.
Pamire was a prominent Zimbabwean entrepreneur who is credited for having been one of the first Zimbabweans to call for black empowerment, and was influential in the formation of the black empowerment lobby group, Affirmative Action Group (AAG) in 1994.

Pamire died in a car crash on March 9, 1997 after his car brakes failed him resulting in the accident which claimed his life. It is said that Pamireâs Mitsubishi Pajero developed a technical problem and overturned along Addington Lane in Ballantyne Park, Borrowdale.

There were widespread speculations that the car that he was driving was tempered with before the accident actually happened. It was also claimed that about twenty people testified on the case forcing the judge to order a thorough investigation but the investigation never took off, according to Pindula News.

âThere have been a lot of conspiracy theories about the death of Pamire, some of the speculations claimed that his vehicle overturned after he had been shot while coming from the Harare International Airport,â the news agency reports.
âIt also emerged that forensic analysts had ruled out the death being a result of an accident but were due to foul play, however the widespread rumours were unsubstantiated as there was no evidence which was brought forward. Among some of the rumours surrounding the death of Pamire were allegations that he was having an affair with the former first lady Grace Mugabe before the time of his death.â

âWeâre talking about a devil worshiper here, said the former Presidentâs family member.
âAifunga kuti takapata (he thought that we were foolish) asi ayirasa (he has lost it). Judgement day is coming. Munhu upi asinganyare (He has no shame). President Mugabe innocently visited his dilapidating mansion in Borrowdale, thatâs the occasion he used to bewitch the president. This living demon is dangerous and controls Zimbabwe from the spiritual realm. Even the current leader of our nation pays homage to him, because he was put in power by this wicked man, who Mnangagwa has even made a parliamentarian. So you might think that Mnangagwa has power, thatâs a dream, this rogue who killed Mugabe is micro-managing Mnangagwa from the spiritual and occultic realm.â

186,"Former Maldives President Abdulla Yameen has been sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering.

The charges focused on a payment of $1m (Â£770,000) by a private company that was supposed to go to the state.

Prosecutors said the money, fees for leasing land for tourism development, went instead to Yameen's bank account. He denied the accusations.

The controversial former president served for five years until his surprise defeat in the 2018 election.

Widely seen as pro-China and accused of crushing dissent in the archipelago, Yameen was also ordered by the court in the capital, Male, to pay a fine of $5m. He is expected to appeal.

Judge Ali Rasheed, who headed a panel of five judges trying the case, said it had been established beyond any reasonable doubt that Yameen had taken money that he knew was embezzled from the state.

Dozens of the former president's supporters gathered outside the court, saying his was innocent.

The Maldives is a key battleground in the rivalry between China and India. Famous for its 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, it is home to more than 400,000 people.

Tourism is a vital part of its economy but there are fears for the archipelago's future because of climate change.",am
187,"Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich has been forced to deny an explosive allegation that he was known for âsuspicion of money laundering and presumed contacts with criminal organisationsâ.

The billionaire Russian, who was unable to obtain a UK visa, lost a seven-month battle against a Swiss newspaper publisher to stop the allegations, reportedly made by Switzerlandâs federal police, from being published.

Claims made in Swiss publication 24heures say the countryâs Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) made a report to the countryâs immigration service, which raised concerns about Abramovich after he applied to become a resident.

Abramovich applied for a Swiss residency to live at a ski resort in the south-western province of Canton in July 2016, personally contacting the head of federal police to insist his permit be granted, 24heures reported.

The newspaper said Abramovichâs application was initially accepted, with a local residency bureaucrat describing him as a âvery attractive taxpayerâ.

After authorities passed the application on to Fedpol, investigators sounded the alarm, producing a report in January 2017 which alleged Abramovich would pose âthreat to public security and a reputational riskâ, adding âthe applicantâs assets are at least partially of illegal originâ, according to Tamedia, the media company which owns 24heures.

Abramovich became aware of objections last year, and in November 2017 wrote a letter of complaint to Fedpol director Nicoletta della Valle. Fedpol rejected his complaint, saying they stood by their decision.

Journalists obtained Fedpolâs assessment, but were banned from publishing it after Abramovich obtained a court order, which was overturned last week.

Abramovichâs lawyer, Daniel Glasl, has requested the Swiss police make a correction of facts, saying in a statement: âWe are extremely disappointed by the release and publication of confidential information from Swiss government files regarding Mr Abramovich, which occurred in clear violation of Swiss criminal law and Swiss data protection laws.

âWe have filed a request for correction of facts to the Swiss Federal Police and will be filing a criminal complaint against unknown persons responsible for dissemination of this confidential information.

âAny suggestion that Mr Abramovich has been involved in money laundering or has contacts with criminal organisations is entirely false.â

A Fedpol spokesperson told City A.M.: âBased on informations from various sources, Fedpol assesses whether a residence permit endangers Switzerland's internal or external security.

The decision on the granting of a residence permit is the responsibility of [SEM, the Swiss migration authority]. There are several cases in which the SEM has refused to issue a residence permit after evaluating the safety assessment of Fedpol.â

Possessing a $14.7bn (Â£11.17bn) fortune derived from metals and oil according to Bloomberg, Abramovich became one of Russiaâs best-known UK-based oligarchs following his Â£140m takeover of Chelsea football club in 2003. He owns the worldâs largest fleet of luxury yachts.

He holds a Â£1.22bn stake in the club, which remains one of his biggest UK assets alongside a Â£2.2bn stake in steel-maker Evraz and his Â£152m Kensington mansion.

Earlier this year, it was reported that Abramovich had been experiencing visa problems in the UK, after new regulations meant he was not offered investor residency status, and the oligarch withdrew his residency application in spring, later obtaining Israeli citizenship. Last month, the Sunday Times reported that he had hired an investment bank to consider the sale of his stake in Chelsea, having turned down an offer from entrepreneur Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",am

190,"Action Targets Drug Trafficker Operating in the Port of Callao and his Network

Washington â Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Peruvian national Gino Dusan Padros Degregori as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker (SDNT) pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. OFAC also designated Peruvian national Guillermo Jean Pierre Zegarra Martinez, a key financial facilitator for Padros Degregori, for providing material assistance, support, or goods or services in support of the international narcotics trafficking activities of, and acting for or on behalf of, Padros Degregori. Three businesses in Lima, Peru, that are owned or controlled by Padros Degregori, were also designated. As a result of today's action, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions or otherwise dealing with these individuals and entities, and any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

""Treasury, in coordination with our law enforcement partners, continues to target and disrupt the activities of those who play a significant role in narcotics trafficking throughout the world,"" said OFAC Director John E. Smith. ""Today's action highlights the increasing reach of Peruvian drug trafficking organizations that move significant amounts of cocaine to Europe and North America.""

Today's OFAC designation was taken in coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Customs and Border Protection's National Targeting Center.

Padros Degregori has been involved in narcotics trafficking for more than a decade, exploiting Lima's Port of Callao to ship approximately 1,000-kilogram cocaine loads per month concealed in containerized cargo â including heavy machinery â to destinations in Western Europe, Mexico, and the United States. Padros Degregori has ties to Mexican drug trafficking organizations that maintain a strong presence in Peru, including the Sinaloa Cartel. He also launders millions in drug proceeds in U.S. dollars and euros back to Peru from both the United States and Europe. Zegarra Martinez travels to the United States and Europe where he supports the collection and laundering of narcotics proceeds destined for Peru on behalf of Padros Degregori.

The Peruvian businesses designated by OFAC are all owned, controlled, or directed by Padros Degregori. The Lima-based businesses include R Inver Corp S.A.C., a real estate and construction company; G & M Autos S.A.C., an automobile repair shop; and SBK Import S.A.C., an importer of automobiles, boats, and heavy machinery.

Since June 2000, more than 2,000 individuals and entities have been named pursuant to the Kingpin Act for their role in international narcotics trafficking. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1,437,153 per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

191,"LAS VEGAS, Nev. â A federal jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, yesterday convicted Craig P. Orrock, a former attorney and former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee, of tax evasion and obstructing the internal revenue laws, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departmentâs Tax Division, U.S. Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich for the District of Nevada, and Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan of IRS-Criminal Investigation.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, starting in the early 1990s, Orrock, currently of Sandy, Utah, evaded the payment of his federal income taxes and obstructed IRS efforts to collect those taxes. Orrock filed federal individual income tax returns for the years 1993 through 2015, but failed to pay the income taxes reported as due. He attempted to prevent the IRS from collecting the reported income taxes through the use of nominee entities, bank accounts and trusts to hide his income and assets from IRS collection officers. Orrock attempted to evade the assessment of a large part of the income tax he owed for 2007, by concealing from the IRS both the ownership of real estate he held through a nominee known as Arville Properties LLC as well as the proceeds from the sale of the property.

From 1993 through 2015, Orrock evaded the payment of over $500,000 in federal income taxes.

Orrock faces up to five years in prison on each of the first two counts and up to three years in prison on the third count, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 26.

âPhillipâ is presumably BPM Festival co-founder Phillip Pulitano while âGolfosâ and âPelonesâ could refer to the drug gangs Cartel del Golfo and Los Pelones.

The message could mean that the Zetas cartel was behind the shooting.

The Facebook-based news outlet Semanario Playa News, which broke the story of the narco-signs, reported that âFayo Zâ could be Quintana Roo Zeta leader Rafael del Ãngel Velez Morales.

Five people died and 15 were wounded in gunfire at the Blue Parrot, a venue for the closing night of the 10-day BPM Festival, an international electronic music festival held annually in Playa del Carmen.

The stateâs Attorney General said this morning that investigators were examining the possibility that drug sales were the principal motive in the shooting, caused by dealers fighting over territory.

Miguel Ãngel Pech has said that extortion is also being considered as a motive.

He said security video shows the attacker enter the bar and fire five times at a man who has been identified as part of the festivalâs security team. However, his family said the man, who lived in Veracruz, was actually a telephone company employee on vacation in the Riviera Maya resort city.

The shooter is believed to have fled in a taxi, whose driver has a criminal record for extortion and is also a former municipal police officer.

The dead have been identified as:

â¢ Kirk Wilson, a Canadian who was the festivalâs security supervisor at the Blue Parrot;

â¢ Daniel Pessina, an Italian and a member of the festival staff;

â¢ Alejandra Margarita Villanueva Ibarra, from the U.S.;

â¢ Geovanni Francisco Ruiz Murillo, of Veracruz; and

â¢ Rafael Antonio PeÃ±aloza Vega, also of Veracruz.

Authorities have not said which of the victims the attacker was after.

However, the newspaper Milenio reported that Ruiz Murillo, who was hit four times during the shooting, had two Facebook profiles, one of which showed him in a police uniform and carrying arms.

In the other his profile picture showed him with an AK-47 firearm and a post advised he had a new job.

This yearâs BPM Festival was the 10 th but may well be its last, in Playa del Carmen at least. âAt the moment our position is that BPM will not happen [again],â said Mayor Cristina Torres GÃ³mez yesterday afternoon.

She told a press conference there would be a reassessment of the requirements and procedures for obtaining permits in terms of security so as to guarantee the safety of tourists and residents.

â. . . we have to analyze the type of destination we want to have, what type of events we want to have and promote . . . .â

Another similar festival, Arena Festival 2017, scheduled for February 1-6, has been suspended while stronger security measures are considered, the mayor said.

The business community made its position clear yesterday. âWeâre asking for these kinds of events to go away,â said MarÃ­a Helena Mata Pineda, president of the local branch of the Business Coordinating Council. âWe donât want BPM here anymore, or any other similar event.â",am

Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges brought by New Yorkâs Department of Financial Services are the second in that regulatorâs probe into the opioid industry, following similar charges against Mallinckrodt Plc on April 21.

New York said Endo, which made 18.4% of opioids distributed from 2006 to 2014 in the state, downplayed the risks of addiction and abuse of opioids such as its Opana ER, giving patients greater comfort about using them to relieve pain.

It also said Endo knew it was contributing to a âmassiveâ surge in opioid prescriptions, leading to payments of fraudulent insurance claims on medically unnecessary prescriptions.

âAll these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were,â Cuomo said in a statement. âTheir greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable.â

Endo removed a reformulated Opana ER from the market in July 2017 after a request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

New York charged Endo with violating two state insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Its shares closed down 66.5 cents, or 14.7%, at $3.845 on the Nasdaq, with most of the decline in late trading after the charges were announced.

The company is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Endo said in a recent regulatory filing it faced more than 3,200 opioid-related lawsuits, mainly by cities, counties and other municipalities.

A US lawyer has been found guilty for his role in the OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, which raised billions of pounds from investors convinced they were buying into a new digital currency.

A New York jury found that Mark Scott helped to perpetrate the scheme, routing approximately $400m (Â£310m) out of the US while working to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds.

Prosecutors said he made about $50m.

Mr Scott's lawyers had said he did not know that OneCoin was worthless.

They said he was simply doing the job asked by Dr Ruja Ignatova, a co-founder of the Bulgaria-based OneCoin.

The federal jury in Manhattan rejected those arguments, finding Mr Scott guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud.

Dr Ignatova's brother, who testified in the case, also recently pleaded guilty for his role in the fraud.

US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case.

In total, investigators believe as much as Â£4bn was raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK among other countries.

""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys said in one filing.

""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand.""

Indian drinks tycoon Vijay Mallya, who is charged with committing fraud in India, has been re-arrested in London.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday afternoon, after India issued new charges of money-laundering against him.

Mr Mallya denies any wrongdoing. The allegations are linked to the collapse of his airline, Kingfisher.

The 61-year-old left India in March 2016 more than $1bn (Â£755m) in debt, after defaulting on bank loan payments.

He was released on police bail after the hearing.

Mr Mallya's monetary affairs are being investigated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Enforcement Directorate - which handles financial crimes.

He was originally arrested and bailed in April after India asked for his extradition in February.

The mogul has rejected claims that he fled his home country over circling creditors, saying outside court: ""I have not eluded any court. If it is my lawful duty to be here, I'm happy to be here.""

Mr Mallya is a flamboyant figure previously dubbed ""India's Richard Branson"" and the ""King of Good Times"" for his lavish lifestyle.",am

The French daily Le Monde reported on October 5 that Franceâs National Court of Asylum Issues, the CDNA, had granted asylum to the fugitive former banker.
In its ruling, dated September 29, the court deplored direct pressure from Kazakhstan and ""the obvious attempts by outside agents to exert influence on the asylum authorities,"" according to the report.
Le Monde said the court had reviewed for several months Ablyazov's appeal against an earlier decision by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons to reject Ablyazovâs asylum request.
His lawyer, Bota Jardemalie, wrote on Facebook on October 4 that the CDNAâs decision was made ""despite the most massive political pressure by Kazakhstan on the leadership of France, international lobbying organized by [Kazakhstan's] regime, its dirty PR, fabricated accusations, manipulations and direct pressure on the French justice [system].""
Ablyazov has been a vocal critic of Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev and his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbaev.
In recent years, he has been organizing and coordinating the activities of his Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement and protest rallies in Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan, and other towns and cities via the Internet.
Ablyazov, a former head of Kazakhstan's BTA bank, who has been residing in Europe for more than a decade, is wanted by Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine on suspicion of embezzling some $5 billion.
In November 2018, a court in Kazakhstan sentenced Ablyazov in absentia to life in prison after finding him guilty of organizing the 2004 murder of Erzhan Tatishev, the head TuranAlem bank, which was later renamed BTA.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The founder of drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc and four colleagues were found guilty on Thursday of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive painkiller, helping to drive the U.S. opioid drug abuse crisis.

A federal jury in Boston found John Kapoor, who served as the drugmaker's chairman, and his co-defendants guilty of racketeering conspiracy for a scheme that also misled insurers into paying for the drug.

Kapoor, 75, is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive convicted in a case tied to a drug crisis that has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually. His 2017 arrest came the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared the epidemic a public health emergency.

Prosecutors charged that Kapoor oversaw a wide-ranging scheme to bribe doctors nationwide by retaining them to act as speakers at sham events at restaurants ostensibly meant to educate clinicians about its fentanyl spray, Subsys.

""Dr. Kapoor is disappointed in the verdict, as are we,"" Beth Wilkinson, one of Kapoor's defense attorneys said in an emailed statement. ""Four weeks of jury deliberations confirm that this was far from an open-and-shut case.""

Michael Babich, who resigned as Insys' chief executive in 2015, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in January and became a key witness for prosecutors.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Subsys in 2012 only for use in treating severe cancer pain. Yet prosecutors claimed doctors who took bribes often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer, helping boost sales for Chandler, Arizona-based Insys.

Prosecutors said Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers into paying for the drug. His co-defendants include former Insys executives and managers Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan.

The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Lawyers for Kapoor at trial acknowledged that Insys paid doctors but contend that he believed they really were being paid to talk up the product's benefits.

The jury heard evidence early in the trial about Lee, an ex-stripper turned Insys regional sales director, who gave a lap dance to a doctor at a Chicago club as part of an effort to push him to prescribe the drug.

After the verdict was read, Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs to confine Kapoor to his home until he is sentenced, saying his wealth made him a flight risk. Burroughs denied that request.

All five had pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",am

The heir to the Nina Ricci perfume and fashion fortune has been convicted of tax fraud by a Paris court after hiding millions in an offshore HSBC account.

Arlette Ricci, 73, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay a â¬1 million (Â£720,000;$1.1m) fine.

The court also confiscated two properties worth four million euros (Â£2.9m;$4.2m).

HSBC's Swiss private banking arm is being investigated after a leak revealed large scale tax fraud.

Ms Ricci, who can appeal, was given a two-year suspended sentence on top of her one-year custodial sentence.

Her daughter, Margot Vignat, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Ms Ricci was accused of hiding millions of euros from the French authorities to evade tax using an offshore HSBC account.

She was ordered by the court to pay millions in back taxes for the period of 2007-2009, with the exact amount to be set at a later date.

Ms Ricci's lawyer, Jean-Marc Fedida, claimed his client had been made an example of, calling her sentence ""extremely severe"".

Mr Fedida said he may ask the judge to let Ms Ricci serve the sentence under lenient conditions, such as partial liberty or wearing an electronic tag.

But telephone recordings quoted in court apparently showed that the perfume heiress was aware she was breaking the law.

In one phone conversation, she said, laughing, ""I believe I did the right thing and I never heard from Bercy so all is well,"" referring to the French finance ministry.

""Yes, inevitably, necessarily because all that is illegal anyway,"" she said.

'Unacceptable' practices

Ms Ricci, who has consistently denied the accusations against her, will now have to decide whether to appeal against her conviction.

She was the first of around 50 French nationals to face trial over tax evasion in the HSBC case. Her prosecution was seen as a test case for the so-called ""Swissleaks"" scandal.

A list of thousands of HSBC's clients was passed to the French government in 2009 by whistleblower Herve Falciani, a former employee of the bank's private operation in Switzerland.

But the bank's tax-evasion practices didn't come to light until the documents were reported by the BBC's Panorama programme and a host of other international media outlets in 2015.

Widespread media coverage led to criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina but not in the UK, where HSBC is based.

The UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted.",am
207,"A First 1989 commission of inquiry into the illegal sale of trucks and motor vehicles, commissioned by President Robert Mugabe and headed by former Judge President Wilson Sandura, exposes the extent of corruption by government officials.

The report, while in some cases pointing out wrongdoing by senior officials, finds mitigating circumstances that might have been designed to ensure the accused were not brought to justice.

The Chronicle headed by Geoff Nyarota, broke the story in 1988 which became known as the âWillowgate scandalâ in which senior officials were accused of using a government facility to purchase vehicles from Willowvale Motor Industries and resell them for profit.

The Sandura commissionâs first inquiry rocked the government at the time. The Zimbabwenewslive.com will in the next few weeks make available the details of the report. Our last reported focused on current Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda. This week we look at Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri (born Oppah Chamu Zvipange Muchinguri who is the current Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe. She has also served as Minister of Higher Education and Minister of Womenâs Affairs.

Allegations

The allegation against this Deputy Minister was that in May 1988 she purchased a motor vehicle from Willowvale and resold it shortly thereafter at a price exceeding the controlled price. The moto vehicle in question was a Toyota Cressida Sedan, Registration No.477-519H, 1988 model.

Evidence

The commission heard evidence from the following witnesses:

G. Long, N. Davis, K.Jarvis, J.Magura and O.Muchinguri.

In addition, the Commission received an affidavit from A.Mawere who is presently working in the United States of America.

Muchinguriâs evidence is as follows:-

When she became a Member of Parliament in October 1987 she did not own a motor vehicle. She approached the speaker of the House of Assembly, informed him that she wanted to purchase a motor vehicle and sought his assistance .He referred her to the Secretary for Industry and Technology. She saw him and sometime in December, 1987, she was informed by the Ministry of Industry and Technology that her name had been placed on a list of persons to be allocated new vehicles. In January, 1988 she was appointed a deputy Minister and a C.M.E.D motor vehicle was allocated to her for her use. The need to purchase a motor vehicle, therefore, fell away. However, in May, 1988, she was informed that a new Toyota Cressida motor vehicle had been allocated to her and was ready for collection from Willowvale.

Because she no longer needed the motor vehicle she phoned Willowvale and spoke to a person called Magura. Magura advised he that if she no longer needed the vehicle she could assign it to another person. Accordingly, she contacted her friend, Mawere, who needed a motor vehicle. Mawere went to Willowvale, paid cash for the motor vehicle and collected it. The vehicle was collected in Muchinguri âs name. She did not know what happened to the motor vehicle thereafter and she received no benefit from the transaction. Contrary to what the Deputy Minister said, Magura denied that he had been contacted by her. He also denied that he had advised her that she could assign the motor vehicle to another person, though he admitted seeing Mawere when he came to Willowvale to pay for the motor vehicle.

In his Affidavit Mawere admits purchasing the motor vehicle from Willowvale but states that shortly thereafter he had to leave for the United States. Before leaving he took the motor vehicle to a company called Executive Cars and sold to that company for about $30 000. He himself had paid $29 908, 80 for it.After the sale, he left the country.

In their evidence, Long and Davies said that they acted as agents for Executive cars and sold the motor vehicle to African Distillers for $95 000. The proprietors of Executive Cars are out of the country at the moment and the commission has not, therefore, been able to question them. In addition, Mawere is in the United States.

In the circumstances, the Commission cannot determine whether or not it was Deputy Minister or Mawere or both who sold the motor vehicle for $95000 and benefited financially. Further, we cannot say whether or not the actual seller of the motor vehicle was Executive Cars. What we can say, however, is that it was improper for the Deputy Minister to assign the motor vehicle to another person other than a Member of Parliament. We feel that as she no longer required the car she should have informed the Speaker of the House of Assembly or Secretary for Industry and Technology who would have reallocated the motor vehicle to another Member of Parliament or to else who might have deserved the allocation.",am
208,"The United States Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals with laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency by hacking a cryptocurrency exchange. Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. As a result, defendants must forfeit any property and funds involved in the scheme.

In 2018, North Korean actors stole approximately $250 million by hacking an online cryptocurrency exchange. The cryptocurrency was âlaundered through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions aimed at preventing law enforcement from tracing the funds.â Additionally, the hackers âcircumvented multiple virtual currency exchangesâ know-your-customer controls by submitting doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation.â Some of the funds were used for North Koreaâs financial industry hacking efforts.

âToday, we are publicly exposing a criminal networkâs valuable support to North Koreaâs cyber heist program and seizing the fruits of its crimes,â Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers from the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division said. âThis case exemplifies the commitment of the United States government to work with foreign partners and the worldwide financial services industry to disrupt this blended threat.â

Yinyin and Jiadong laundered more than $100 million in cryptocurrency, mostly from exchange hacks, between December 2017 and April 2019. They used independent and linked accounts and they âprovided virtual currency transmission services for a fee for customers.â They did business in the United States but were not registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

âNorth Korea continues to attack the growing worldwide ecosystem of virtual currency as a means to bypass the sanctions imposed on it by the United States and the United Nations Security Council. IRS-CI is committed to combatting the means and methods used by foreign and domestic adversaries to finance operations and activities that pose a threat to U.S. national security,â Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Don Fort said. âWe will continue to push our agency to the forefront of complex cyber investigations and work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to ensure these nefarious criminals are stopped and that the integrity of the United States financial system is preserved.â

âThe FBI will continue to actively work with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to identify and mitigate illicit movement of currency,â Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division said. âTodayâs indictment and sanctions send a strong message that the United States will not relent in holding accountable bad actors attempting to evade sanctions and undermine our financial system.â

There were 113 named virtual currency accounts and addresses used by Yinyin, Jiadong, and the North Korean hackers. The DOJ seeks to recover the remainder of the funds.

The United States Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions on the two Chinese nationals and a variety of cryptocurrency addresses involved in the scheme.

âThis indictment shows what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to uncover complex cross-border crimes,â Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) said. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would steal cryptocurrency for their illicit purposes.â

210,"It is no longer a secret that Senator Bukola Saraki has emerged as a powerful symbol of the rotten sweetness of democratized corruption in Nigeria. As you read this, the thugs in the pocket of Senator Saraki masquerading as Nigerian senators are tightening the rope of strangulation on President Buhariâs lackluster anti-corruption war. They have vowed that Maguâs head must be cut off or everything in Nigeria will be grounded to a halt. This National Assembly under the leadership of Bukola Saraki is the most dangerously corrupt Assembly in Nigerian history.

Consider this scenario: a sick President was recuperating in London; the cabal that caged Mr. President allowed Senator Bukola Saraki to pay him a rare visit (a special privilege you will think); Mr. President comes back and went into a closed door meeting with Saraki and less than 48 hours, the Senate soundly rejected the confirmation of Magu as EFCC chair for the second time (facilitated by Sarakiâs thugs and DSS director appointed by Mr. President). Troubling?

On the surface, you will be tempted to believe that our democracy is finally working â checks and balances and independent DSS. Illusions! The reality is that we are witnessing the smooth operation of one of the smartest and âpathologically corruptâ political operatives in modern Nigeria in Bukola Saraki (I have not forgotten the gibberish of âinnocentâ until proven guilty).

To say that Senator Saraki is the most powerful political operative in the Nigeria is not an overstatement. Even before he rose to power, he was highly connected by virtue of his father Dr. Olusola Saraki â the strong man of Kwara politics. To understand how powerful the Sarakis are, look at the history of their dynasty in Kwara State dating back to the late 1970s. Unlike other dynasties in Nigeria, the reign of the Sarakis has not been challenged for over 35 years.

To demonstrate that he is âuntouchable,â Senator Saraki, who is already involved in a series of corruption trials (false declaration of assets, embezzlement of state fund), is not shying away from adding to his collection of corruption-stained-feathers. The newest scandal is the disappearance of about N3.5 billion refund of Paris Club loan. Fingered in this scandal are Aliko Dangote, the Nigeria Governors Forum and the Central Bank of Nigeria. This has once more rekindled the debate about how to tackle democratized corruption in Nigeria.

The primary reason why corruption has thrived in Nigeria is because perpetrators at all levels have been clever enough to ensure that all relevant parties are âsettled.â High and Supreme Court judges, law enforcers and political whistleblowers are, most times, silenced by receiving a cut from the loot or forced by unseen hands wielding more power than the government to succumb to intimidation and blackmail. Dasukigate and Diezanigate are two good examples.

To underscore the seriousness of democratized corruption, Godwin Elumelu, who led an investigation into the misappropriation of billions of Naira in the power sector under Obasanjoâs administration, confessed that the âfight against corruption poses grave and unpredictable risks to those who dare to challenge this gargantuan monster.â He added, âthe greater part of the Nigerian problem is the ruling elite; selfish, greedy, unpatriotic and often lawless.â

Apparently, Senator Saraki is not only a smooth operator, but so powerful and lawless that it was rumored last week that he threatened to unleash hell on Buhariâs administration if they push him too hard. This threat came after the EFCC had submitted a damning report on Senator Sarakiâs involvement in siphoning N3.5 billion from the Paris Club loan refund - a gargantuan scandal.

In a shocking response, Mr. President ordered an additional release of the Paris Club loan refund even in the face of these allegations. This singular act by President Buhari is an indication that he has been caught by the charm of the rotten sweetness of democratized corruption.

Is President Buhari complicit in encouraging the democratization of corruption in Nigerian institutions? Will Buhari sanction the plot by the DSS and the thugs called senators to redeploy Magu? Is he completely caged now? Is it a âmajor, general mistakeâ (thanks Sowore) for President Buhari to be romancing corrupt institutions and individuals while pretending to be fighting corruption? I see the ongoing caricature as simply a case of democratization of corruption; a case of the more you look the more you see, literally.

Recently this administration demonstrated what looks like rare courage by going after the untouchables in our judiciary. The question, though, is: was the show of power against the judiciary selective and cosmetic? Is there any real intent to punish corrupt government officials? Or like the administrations before this, is the story of anti-corruption in Nigeria an illusion?

The clampdown, or what the Presidency called a âsurgicalâ operation, on corruption in the Nigerian judiciary, though a welcome development, is not enough. If indeed there is a real attempt to fight institutionalized corruption in Nigeria, why limit the âsurgicalâ operation to the judiciary? What of the Nigeria Police Force and Nigeria Customs Service â the two powerhouses of institutionalized corruption in Nigeria? What of NNPC â the goose that is laying the golden eggs? What of the Nigerian National Assembly - the cog in the wheel?

Gone are the days when corrupt practices led to the demise of the leadership of the Nigerian National Assembly. Where the likes of Okadigbo, Wabara, Evan(s) Enwerem, Etteh and Bankole failed, Bokola Saraki is thriving. You know why? He has simply perfected the act of institutionalized corruption in Nigeria. As a matter of fact, he took on the persona of a mini god, terrifying and controlling the Presidency and the National Assembly.

Senator Bukola Saraki is a smooth political operator that financed the election of President Buhari. He is an APC member on paper, but was elected Senate President by the opposing PDP members after outsmarting his party. Initially haunted by Buhariâs Presidency, Saraki is now being courted by the cabals behind Buhari for fear of giving Atiku or Tinubu an edge in the repositioning for the 2019 presidential election.

The President is currently limiting the anti-corruption âfightâ on the tilapias like Dasuki, Badeh, Metu, etc. But until the cabals around him can summon the courage to point a real âsurgicalâ anti-corruption knife on the crocodiles at the National Assembly, Saraki, who has not been convicted of any corrupt act, will go scot-free under the present state of democratized corruption in Nigeria. Forget about the ongoing drama at the CCB meant to deceive the general public.

Senator Bukola Saraki is a friendly, well-spoken, handsome guy and above all, a smooth political operator. There's little question that he is a political hottie now, but whether his charms will stand the test of time remains to be seen.",am

The Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee was swimming in cash, and by the time the festivities had ended, it had raised over $107 millionâfar more than any other presidential inaugural in history. But it also spent extravagantly, and according to documents recently revealed as part of a lawsuit, staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with themâmuch of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

The records made public as part of the lawsuit reveal that there was a real lack of separation between the Trumps as business owners and the Trumps as the incoming first family. Shortly after the 2016 election, as the newly formed committee was scrambling to organize inaugural events, Rick Gates, the committeeâs deputy chair, received a quote from the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the cost of using the hotelâs ballroom. The price tag for the luxury DC establishment, housed in the historic Old Post Office building and owned and operated by the family of the president-elect was huge: $3.6 million for eight days of use, or $450,000 per day. Gates emailed Ivanka Trump, who owns a piece of the hotel, to raise his concerns.

Staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with themâmuch of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

âFirst, the cost itself seems quite high compared to other property buyouts for the week,â Gates wrote. âSecond, I am a bit worried about the optics of PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee] paying Trump Hotel a high fee and the media making a big story out of it.â

A few days later, Ivanka Trump told Gates that she had called the general manager of the property and the hotel came back to the inaugural committee with a new quoteâbetter, but still asking for $175,000 a day. That rate far exceeded the hotelâs own internal pricing guidelines, and it seems likely that Ivanka Trump, as a part-owner, knew that. (For comparison, the new court filing shows that another nonprofit paid just $5,000 to use part of the Trump Hotel ballroom for part of one of the days the Inaugural Committee had rented it, which matched the internal guidelines.)

At this point, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump who managed much of the inaugural planning, warned Ivanka Trump and Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision hereâaudits on what locations were used and how much was paid to use them would be made public. âI understand that compared to the original pricing this is great but we should look at the whole context,â Winston Wolkoff wrote, adding that she thought $85,000 a day was the most she considered to be reasonable.

Winston Wolkoffâs concerns were ignored. The Presidential Inaugural Committee ended up paying the Trump Hotel $1 million for four days use of the hotelâs ballroom.

They probably should have heeded Winston Wolkoffâs warnings. The lawsuit bringing these records to light was filed by Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, DC, against the Inaugural Committee and the Trump Organization. Racine is arguing that the district has the right to seek the repayment of funds because nonprofits operating in Washington, DC, which the Inaugural Committee did, may not work to create profits for a private organization or individual. According to Racine, the Inaugural Committee âcoordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel.â The attorney general is asking that the money be returned and given to charities that promote civic engagement. (Racine is also separately involved with one of the emoluments lawsuits against the president regarding the Trump Old Post Office hotel, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland.)

If the new lawsuit, which was filed this week, goes forward, it could release a further avalanche of details on how the most lavishly funded inaugural celebration frittered away tens of millions of dollarsâand more details about how involved the Trump family itself was in the decision-making.

Unsurprisingly, representatives of the inaugural committee issued a statement to the Washington Post insisting that there was no misconduct.

Racineâs lawsuit also highlights how negotiations between the inaugural committee and the hotel happened specifically in the context of profits for the hotel. In early January 2017, when the committee was considering pulling out of at least one event at the hotel, the hotelâs manager emailed Gates highlighting his concerns: âJust heard that the Friday night reception had been canceled. Is it accurate? Tough on us if it is as it was a lot of revenue for 1,250 people,â Mickael Damelincourt wrote. Gates continued the negotiation.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump, warned Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here. Her concerns were ignored.

Racineâs supporting documents also offer a sense of the (sometimes comical) internal decisions being made for the most expensive inaugural celebration ever, which featured sparse crowds and far fewer events than normal. (Lists of tasks for inaugural committee staff are included in the suit because of the explicit references in them to the negotiations over use of the hotel space.) For instance, there are repeated mentions of Trumpâs desire to arrive at a celebration on the mall in a military helicopter, flanked by members of the military. This idea was apparently nixed because at the time of the celebrations, Trump was not yet commander in chief. The documents also describe the president-electâs hopes for military helicopters and tanks to flank the stage at the outdoor celebration. Another note describes how Donald and Ivanka Trump jointly decided that the Beach Boys would not be performing. At one point, a to-do list item includes asking Melania Trump about a family-and-friends tea reception at the White House, followed by a note from an inaugural committee staffer, âThere should be NO reception.â Later, a more adamant note appeared: âConfirmed that NO tea will be hosted at WH and must be removed from schedule.â

Still, some of the most damning material revealed here has nothing to do with the Trump family and their over-the-top plans for the celebration. The documents repeatedly mention that inaugural committee staff should consult with Steve Wynn, the billionaire owner of Wynn Resorts who is a longtime GOP donor and personal friend of Donald Trump. The suggestions are highly specificâWynn directing that the song â40 Hours a Weekâ by the band Alabama be played at an inaugural event. In 2018, Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct, which led him to step down as CEO of his casino company and as a finance chair for the Republican National Committee.",am
212,"LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambiaâs Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya has been arrested on suspicion of corruption, an anti-graft body said on Wednesday.

Chilufya, 47, was charged with four counts of possession of property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) spokesman Jonathan Siame said in a statement. The statement did not specify the property.

âThe arrest follows investigations the Commission has been conducting against the minister in relation to the above allegations,â the statement said.

Chilufya, who faces a maximum of 5 years in jail if convicted, has been released and is expected to appear before the Lusaka Magistrateâs Court on 9th July 2020.",am
213,"A South Florida man has been charged with bilking the Medicare system and also using his pharmacy to obtain federal loans for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said.

Carlos Belone, 37, of Coconut Creek was arrested Friday and had his first appearance in Fort Lauderdale federal court on charges of wire and healthcare fraud along with making false statements to a financial institution. Belone is expected to be granted a $150,000 bond and will be arraigned on July 24. Neither he nor his federal public defender could be reached for comment.

Belone, the owner of R&S Pharmacy in Coral Springs, is accused of submitting $5.6 million in claims to Medicare, the federal health insurance program, for orthotic braces that were medically unnecessary or not provided, according to a criminal complaint. Investigators interviewed patients who said they did not need the orthotic braces or authorize their Medicare numbers to be used for the pharmacyâs claims, the complaint says.

In addition, Belone is accused of using his pharmacy to submit falsified loan applications through the Small Business Administrationâs Payroll Protection Program.

The program offered a total of $650 billion in SBA loans approved by Congress as part of the CARES Act after the COVID-19 pandemic struck the nation in March. The two-year loans are forgiven as long as small businesses mainly use them for covering payroll expenses as well as operational costs such as rent and utilities.

According to the complaint, Belone submitted fake tax documents and fabricated profit and loss statements for his pharmacy to obtain more than $22,000 in PPP loans. Prosecutors say he used the money to further his Medicare scheme and diverted $12,000 to a personal bank account.

The fraud case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.

214,"The trial of the prominent republican Thomas 'Slab' Murphy at Dublin Special Criminal Court has heard that he had access to considerable cash sums despite not supplying tax returns.

The 66-year-old, from Hackballscross in County Louth, denies failing to furnish tax returns between 1996 and 2004.

The charges arise out of a probe by the Irish police's Criminal Assets Bureau.

The trial is taking place before three judges in a non-jury court and is expected to last three weeks.

Counsel for the state has said that despite Mr Murphy applying for and receiving government grants of more than 100,000 euros (Â£73,600) he did not make any returns to revenue commissioners.

He said he will show that Mr Murphy had access to considerable cash, more than 300,000 euros (Â£220,000), for renting land for silage purposes and for dealing with cattle marts.

Grainne Dalton, a retired official from the Irish Department of Agriculture, conceded under cross-examination that she had not personally seen Mr Murphy or any other grant applicant receive or complete forms.

Mr Murphy's lawyer said his client did not accept that he had played any role in submitting grant applications and denied the signatures on the forms were his hand writing.

The presiding judge agreed to a defence request to delay the trial until Thursday to allow them to access disclosure documents.",am
215,"PALO ALTO (CNN) â Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges, the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced Friday.

Holmes and former Theranos COO and president Ramesh âSunnyâ Balwani allegedly engaged in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients, according to a release from the US Attorneyâs office.

Holmes and Balwani are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. The indictments happened Thursday and were unsealed on Friday. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count, according to the US Attorneyâs office.

Minutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The companyâs general counsel, David Taylor, will take over as CEO. Holmes will stay on as chair of the companyâs board.

The company was once valued at as much as $9 billion.

Holmes dropped out of Stanford University to launch Theranos in 2003 with a plan to offer cheaper, more efficient alternative to traditional medical tests. It promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood.

Holmes was once lauded as the youngest self-made female billionaire. But her net worth was revised down to nothing after Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou started digging into the technology behind her blood testing startup.

In March, the SEC announced âmassive fraudâ charges of $700 million against Theranos, Holmes and Balwani. The SEC said Theranos, Holmes and Balwani misled partners and investors about the companyâs technology, misrepresented revenue projections and falsely claimed it didnât need regulatory approval for its testing technology.

Holmes and Theranos reached a settlement with the SEC, while the SEC said it would take its case against Balwani to court.

Jeffrey B. Coopersmith, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine who represents Balwani, called the SEC action against his client âunwarranted.â

âSunny Balwani accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability,â Coopersmith said in a statement.

Investors in Theranos included Oracle founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, now Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.",am
216,"It took three years but a leading federal bank regulator has finally gotten tough with probably the most lawless large financial institution in the country.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, recently took action against the former chief executive of Wells Fargo in connection with the scandal in which the bank pressured employees to create bogus accounts that extracted millions of dollars in fees from unsuspecting customers.

Many observers were surprised that the OCC, not known for aggressive action, fined John Stumpf $17.5 million â the largest penalty it has ever imposed on an individual â and banned him for life from the banking industry. The agency also penalized two other former senior officials at Wells Fargo and charged five others. Among those five is Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of retail banking at Wells, against whom the OCC is seeking a penalty of $25 million, substantially more than what Stumpf agreed to pay.

OCCâs belated severity may have something to do with the fact that the agencyâs posture toward Wells is the subject of a pending investigation by the Treasury inspector general. That inquiry will likely address the failure of the agency to pursue complaints it had received about abusive practices at Wells long before the sham-account scandal erupted in 2016. The agency admitted this lapse in an unflattering report about its conduct released in 2017.

Along with the announcement of its charges against Tolstedt and the others, the OCC released a 100 page Notice which reads like an indictment. It argues that for more than a decade the bank maintained a business model that pressured employees to engage in âserious misconductâ by imposing âintentionally unreasonable sales goalsâ and âfostered an atmosphere that perpetuated improper and illegal conduct.â

The document relates in detail how that pressure worked to the detriment both of the customers who were being defrauded and the bankâs lower level employees. Those employees were turned into accomplices in a corrupt scheme described by the document as âimmenseâ in magnitude.

Also contained in the document are indications that Wells managers were seeking to cover up the wrongdoing. They pretended to monitor improper conduct by lower-level employees but were far from aggressive in that effort. The document notes that the bankâs Head of Corporate Investigations testified before the OCC that there was nearly a 100% chance an employeeâs boss would know if she failed to meet her sales goals, but the chances were very small that an employee would be caught for issuing an unauthorized product or service. Those employees clearly got the message that if they wanted to keep their jobs they had to go along with the scheme.

Unfortunately, the document is part of a civil proceeding when it should really be part of a criminal case against Wells and those who were running it. The shocking misconduct outlined by the OCC belongs in an indictment brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

There are reports that the Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Wells, but it is hard to be confident that Bill Barrâs DOJ will do the right thing.",am
217,"Donald Trump didnât provide his tax returns before he was elected either, unlike every other presidential candidate in recent history. They appear to believe that the usual rules donât apply to them. This raises fundamental questions over their suitability for the highest positions in our country, and it also makes one wonder what they have to hide. As Tillerson prepares for the Senate to review his ability to serve, these questions are more relevant than ever.

Tillersonâs refusal to open up to public scrutiny is consistent with Exxonâs track record of secrecy. In addition to facing allegations that it misled the public over the science behind climate change, the company refuses to open up about its US taxes.

Defenders of Trump and Tillerson argue there are valid privacy concerns behind holding back their tax information. Privacy is important, as enshrined in US law - but it has to be balanced against the public good. As candidates for high public office, Trump and Tillersonâs right to privacy is far outweighed by the need for the public to know that they have paid their dues to society. As President Nixon said, âpeople have got to know whether or not their president is a crookâ â the same applies to their top diplomat. To eliminate any doubt, Tillerson should release his returns to the Senate, just as dozens of Republican and Democrat nominees have done before him.

This raises questions about one of the pillars of the Trump victory. When he speaks about âdraining the swampâ itâs easy to imagine a massive cull of political elites corrupted by financial interests. Whatâs happening now is very different. In casting itself as a team of political outsiders, the Trump campaign has managed to shield itself from accountability and protect its business interests. They are merging the worlds of big business and its regulators, without recognition of the impact this will have on the people they are there to serve. The heads of big business, with secretive financial dealings and no public service record whatsoever, are moving into our nationâs highest seats of power, and disregarding norms designed to hold them to account.

Exxonâs track record under Tillerson on transparency is dire. The natural resource sector is famously corrupt â the worldâs most corrupt industry according to the OECD. But Exxon and other oil companies can no longer hide behind the excuse of confidentiality. Increasingly, companies are expected to disclose what they pay in taxes and other payments to governments of countries whose natural resources they extract. This is now required under laws of the US and 30 other countries, as well as international initiatives. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard which aims to put information about government revenues from natural resource deals into the public domain in 51 countries including the United States. This includes the taxes these companies pay, which is key to ensuring citizens know what benefits they get from their natural resources.

An ongoing anti-corruption probe involving Exxon in Nigeria highlights the need for strong transparency rules. Authorities in Nigeria are investigating how Exxon reportedly paid $600 million to renew three oil licenses that may have been valued by the Nigerian government at $2.55 billion, according to documents seen by Global Witness. Improved payment transparency will shed light on and deter these types of questionable deals.

Exxon publicly supports these transparency efforts: it has long maintained a seat on the EITIâs international board, and also has a representative on the domestic US EITI governing body. In reality, however, Exxon has mastered the art of paying lip service to transparency while doing all it can to undermine these efforts behind the scenes. Exxon is refusing to publish its US tax payments, in contrast to some of its competitors such as BP and Shell. And like Trump, Exxon is not just side-stepping the rules â it is actively trying to bring them down. Mr. Tillerson served as a chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful oil lobby group that has fought against a Congressionally-mandated regulation to disclose natural resource payments.

It is now the Senate Committee on Foreign Relationsâ job to decide whether Tillerson is the right person for such an important appointment. With his and Exxonâs track record of keeping critical information away from scrutiny and actively undermining attempts to fight corruption, they must consider if he is really fit to serve the American people.",nam
218,"Under the terms of Executive Order 13581, the US Treasury has been seeking to locate and freeze assets associated with key organized crime kingpins, a range of Japanese, Latin American, Italian and Russian/Eurasian neâer-do-wells. On 30 October, a new set of targets was announced, including six people and four businesses âlinked to the Brothersâ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate.â Iâve written elsewhere (here and here) that I still do not believe that the Brothersâ Circle, as a specific crime group or âcoordinating bodyâ, actually exists and instead that it is aâperfectly reasonableâfiction-of-convenience to allow this Order to be applied against criminals operating within the very loose and often mutable networks of Russian/Eurasian crime.

The latest targets are all reportedly associated with two specific figures, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who were designated back in 2012, both of whom are definitely bad news and especially involved in transnational drug trafficking in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. These newer designated targets are also essentially lesser figures: agents, messengers, money-movers and the like (not a bad thing, for reasons I go into below). These are Treasuryâs claims:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. He is based in Dubai.

Grigory Lepsveridze (known as âGrishaâ or âGrigory Lepsâ) couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev.

Igor Shlykov (âShlykâ) has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyevâs behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls MS Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively (both businesses are also designated).

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov. Moskalenko is an Uzbek citizen now resident in Switzerland, Rybalskiy is Israeli.

Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC are used by key members of the Brothersâ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC, which is based in Dubai.

Here is a handy chart the Treasury also provided, also again it probably makes the relationships and groupings rather too neat:

20131030_brothers_circle

Overall, Iâm a fan of this approach, especially as it now extends to associates and agents. The real aim in my opinion is not just freezing individualsâ assetsâthatâs a good thing, of courseâbut also making designated figures toxic within their networked underworld, such that no one wants to do business with them, organize joint criminal ventures, launder their money or launder money with them, for fear of their assets also getting locked. Anything that strikes at the connections that make these networks effective is very good news indeed.

On the other hand, I was quite surprised about Lepsveridze âs name being on the list, as ÐÐµÐ¿Ñ is one of Russiaâs highest grossing singers, whose music started in the Russky shanson styleârooted in criminal balladsâbut has since progressed into more mainstream directions. Of course there is nothing new about criminals and entertainers being connected, just as Frank Sinatra orâ reportedly âIosif Kobzon. But I do wonder about the political fallout that may ensue. Maybe itâs not something about which Treasury really cares (and I can see the temptation in not caring), but I suspect this will cause quite an uproar in Russia. As is, police cooperation between the USA and Russia is quite tricky and sometimes politically-complex. I do hope that this does not raise further obstacles. But that said, if Treasury are sure of their facts, then it shouldnât matter if the criminal associates are famous or not, they ought to be on the list.",am
219,"Germany's former chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der was yesterday at the centre of damaging allegations of sleaze over his decision to accept a lucrative job with Russia's biggest company.

Opposition MPs joined forces to denounce Mr SchrÃ¶der - who last week confirmed that he was to become chairman of state-controlled Russian giant Gazprom's North European Gas Pipeline company. Mr SchrÃ¶der was accused of bringing German politics into disrepute and of ""cronyism"" and ""corruption"".

Mr SchrÃ¶der signed the controversial pipeline deal for a $6bn (Â£3.4bn) gas link between Germany and Russia under the Baltic Sea with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, just two weeks before leaving office.

The former chancellor yesterday rejected the criticism and announced that he would take legal action over reports he would be paid between â¬200,000 (Â£134,000) and â¬1m a year. Those figures are ""much too high"", Mr SchrÃ¶der told the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

""For me it is a thing of honour to help with the pipeline project,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I supported the project politically in the past because I think it makes sense.""

In May Mr SchrÃ¶der abruptly announced he was holding Germany's general election a year early. He stepped down last month when his Social Democrat party joined a grand coalition under Angela Merkel.

Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats have called on Mr SchrÃ¶der to resign. ""He's done grave damage to Germany's reputation. Unless he quits, his job will look like a reward for his efforts [as chancellor],"" Christian Wulf, the minister-president of Lower Saxony, told Bild yesterday.

""It stinks. It looks to me like sheer cronyism,"" said Richard BÃ¼tikofer, the co-leader of Germany's Greens. Even Mr SchrÃ¶der's old cabinet colleague Peter Struck, Germany's former defence minister, expressed doubts. ""I wouldn't have done it,"" he said.

Unlike Britain, Germany does not have a code of conduct preventing ex-ministers from immediately joining industry once they have left government. But yesterday several MPs said Germany should now consider emulating Britain to prevent - as one put it - the ""whiff of corruption"".

In Mr SchrÃ¶der's seven years in office he failed to criticise Russia's human rights record in Chechnya, praising Mr Putin as a ""thorough democrat"".",am
220,"Former Kosovo ruling party legislator Azem Syla, whom prosecutors accuse of running an organized crime gang that they say deprived the state and Kosovo Serbs of property worth about 30 million Euros (US$ 34 million), was heard in closed session at a Pristina court on Tuesday, reports Balkan Insight.

Syla's case revolves around plots of land the alleged crime group, composed of Kosovo and Serbian citizens, had allegedly acquired cheaply through bribing public officials and falsifying official documentation.

Syla was meant to be detained on April 27, a day after Kosovo prosecutors ordered a crackdown on the alleged organized crime gang. Together with the European Union's police mission in Kosovo (EULEX), local police arrested six alleged members of the group and raided 42 locations that day.

He had left the country, but returned to Kosovo within a couple of days to face the allegations. He was finally arrested on April 29.

According to local news portal Lajmi.net, his lawyer Tome Gashi said Syla was not aware of any investigation against him when he left.

While still being sought by Kosovo authorities, on April 28, Gazeta Express reported that Syla announced his resignation from Parliament in a statement without revealing his location.

While calling the case against him âunfairâ, he expressed his willingness to cooperate with authorities.

At the time, prosecutors said the group is composed of about 40 people, but according to newer news reports, prosecutors believe the group is composed of more than 50 members.

Prosecutors allege that since 2006, Syla and his associates ""misused"" the rights of Serb families to certain plots of land while they were temporarily seized by the Basic Court in Pristina, pending a decision to return them to their original owners once the legal status of the properties is clarified.

After the NATO bombing of 1999 and the withdrawal of all Serbian institutions, these properties and other legal issues have fallen into limbo. It was believed that these issues would be resolved as part of the ongoing EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia.

Kosovo Serbs who fled Kosovo after 1999 sold the properties cheaply, not having any intention to return to the now independent Albanian-majority country.

Reuters reported investigators believe the scheme involved officials and businessmen who bought state-owned land cheaply, only to sell it for a larger profit.

Syla and his alleged associates are accused of abusing their official position, money laundering, falsifying official documents and receiving bribes.

According to Balkan Insight, EULEX prosecutor Danilo Cecarelli said Syla's court hearing was closed to the public because the case is still being investigated.",am

The vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe has been arrested in connection with an investigation into the awarding of a doctorate to former first lady Grace Mugabe.

Levi Nyagura was detained by the country's anti-corruption agency, to be charged with abuse of office.

Mrs Mugabe was awarded a PhD just months after enrolling in 2014, despite it usually taking years to complete.

An investigation was launched after a petition was made by university staff.

Members of the sociology department said they had not seen supporting evidence, and called for the nullification of her qualification and a full investigation.

Hunter is charged with using campaign funds for personal expenses, ranging from groceries to family vacations. The trial date for Congressman Duncan D. Hunterâs corruption charges was scheduled for Jan. 22, 2020.

In an exclusive interview with KUSIâs Steve Bosh, Congressman Duncan D. Hunter announced that he will plead guilty to one count of misuse of campaign funds in Tuesdayâs court appearance.

The congressman said that he will admit to one count of misusing campaign funds, saying he was doing so for the sake of his three children.

His wife, the former campaign treasurer, previously admitted her role in the campaign finance scandal.

Hunter, who had planned to seek another term in the November 2020 election, indicated in the interview that he would step down, while stressing that itâs important to keep the seat in Republican hands. Hunter said his office âwould remain openâ and that there would be a âseamless transition to whoever takes this seat next.â

Hunterâs announcement was updated on the U.S. District Court docket Monday morning. His change of plea hearing is set for December 3, 2019 at 10:00 AM before Judge Thomas J. Whelan.

Hunter, 42, was indicted along with his wife on five dozen criminal counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy and falsification of records, and was facing a Jan. 22 trial date.

Margaret Hunter, 44, pleaded guilty in June to a conspiracy charge and agreed to work with prosecutors on the case. She faces up to five years in federal custody and a fine of up to $250,000 when she is sentenced in April.

Hunter said that while he expects to spend time in custody, he hopes that his wife will not be incarcerated as âI think my kids need a mom in the home.â

Duncan D. Hunter was re-elected last November with 51.7% of the vote in the 50th Congressional District, despite being indicted three months prior. He was first elected in 2008, succeeding his father, who held the congressional seat for 28 years.

Since the charges were brought against Hunter, several challengers have entered the race for the 50th Congressional District, most of whom are fellow Republicans.

Rep. Hunter is being challenged by former Congressman Darrell Issa, Carl DeMaio, State Senator Brian Jones, as well as Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.

Former Congressman Darrell Issa released the following statement in response to Hunterâs announcement.

âAs a friend and a colleague, I thank Duncan Hunter for his service to our country in the Marine Corps and in Congress, where he has always been a strong conservative voice on behalf of his constituents. Though his misuse of campaign funds was clearly wrong, I wish him and his family the best as they address the matters ahead of them.â

Issa stopped by the KUSI News studio Monday morning to further explain what Hunterâs guilty plea means, and how it impacts the highly contested race for the 50th Congressional District. His complete remarks can be seen here.

Former San Diego City Councilman Carl Demaio, who is challenging Hunter for the seat, issued a statement Monday regarding the development.

âWhile this must have been a tough decision for him, Congressman Hunterâs decision to plead guilty is the right one for his family and his constituents and shows that no one should be above the law â especially members of Congress,â he said. âMy thoughts and prayers are with the Hunter family as they go through this difficult process.â

224,"MEXICO CITY â

Federal agents called in the Mexican army to arrest one of the nationâs most powerful drug barons, a man wanted in the 1993 murder of Guadalajaraâs Roman Catholic cardinal, during a late-night raid that also snared 33 federal agents who were protecting him, authorities said Saturday.

Mexicoâs attorney general said Hector Luis Palma Salazar, reputed leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in an exclusive neighborhood of Guadalajara and charged with several murders and drug-related crimes.

Palma allegedly took over one of the five major cartels that U.S. drug enforcement agents say transport three-fourths of the cocaine entering the United States after its previous leader was jailed in the murder of the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. Palma was also wanted in connection with that crime, and the Mexican government had posted a $1-million reward for information leading to his capture.

The arrests late Friday were seen as a clear sign of President Ernesto Zedilloâs commitment to crack down on the cartels. They also underscored the close ties that exist between drug kingpins and some federal officials.

Confirming Palmaâs arrest at an evening news conference in Mexico City, Atty. Gen. Antonio Lozano said the army was called in as a precaution because federal police were directly involved with Palma.

Mexican soldiers formed a cordon around the Guadalajara office of the federal attorney general--to guard against retaliation--while agents from Mexico City arrested Palma, along with Apolinar Pintor Aguilera, the federal judicial police commander. Jalisco state authorities said Palma identified Pintor as his âprotector.â

Authorities also detained 33 federal police officers who they said had been serving as Palmaâs personal bodyguards. Lozano said his agents seized large quantities of drugs and about $10,000 in cash.

Palma was reportedly a lieutenant of Joaquin (Chapo) Guzman, former leader of the cartel in Sinaloa, a state notorious for violence and marijuana production. U.S. and Mexican officials said the cartel has extensive networks in Central and South America and has been instrumental in exporting Colombian cocaine into the United States through Mexico.

Authorities said Palma became the cartelâs leader after Guzmanâs arrest in 1993. Guzman has also been charged with participating in the murder of Posadas, who was shot more than a dozen times in what the previous government called a case of mistaken identity.

Lozano, the first attorney general to come from an opposition political party, has vowed to arrest the leaders of all the major cartels and to solve several high-profile political murders, among them the killing of the cardinal.

Religious leaders and human rights groups have cast doubt on the official version of the slaying on March 24, 1993, outside the Guadalajara airport. Posadas was an outspoken critic of the drug cartels that Mexican and U.S. drug enforcement officials say have infiltrated the government at high enough levels to threaten the nationâs stability.

Officials now say the airport slaying, in which six others died, was masterminded by the Arellano Felix brothers and their Tijuana drug cartel, a rival of Palmaâs Sinaloa cartel. One of the four brothers, Francisco Arellano Felix, has been captured, but the three others remain at large. There is a $1-million reward for information leading to the arrest of any of the brothers.

Authorities have not released details of what roles Guzman and Palma allegedly played in the cardinalâs assassination.

The cardinalâs slaying was the first in a series of political murders that caused billions of dollars in investment to flee the country, helping to trigger Mexicoâs continuing economic crisis and fueling national insecurity.

A year after Posadasâ death, ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was slain in Tijuana. And six months after that, the partyâs secretary general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot to death in Mexico City.",am

Between 2016 and 2018, Righter used counterfeit paintings to conduct transactions in both his own name and under other peopleâs identities. To support his claims that the works were real, Righter created false provenance documents, going so far as to impersonate a member of Basquiatâs estate in his creation of a fraudulent certificate of authenticity. Over the course of his scheme, Righter attempted to sell roughly $6 million in counterfeit art.

He also attempted to use the fraudulent works as collateral for loans he later defaulted on, and also used their falsified value for write-offs on a tax return. One victim was defrauded of $24,000 after attempting to sell a fake Basquiat that Righter had used as loan collateral at auction. He also provided an online auction site with a Basquiat piece that sold for $50,000, which the site had to refund the buyer after the piece was proven to be fake. All told, Righterâs scheme cost victims at least $758,265, and the government around $100,000 in taxes.

226,"Shady Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrabâs money laundering scheme was revealed in leaked U.S. files.

According to the files, the United Arab Emiratesâ central bank, UK-based Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank took part in Zarrabâs scheme.

The FinCEN files are a huge cache of secret reports detailing suspicious financial activity, filed by banks to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD).

BuzzFeed News obtained the files and shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Over the past 16 months, 400 journalists from 88 countries have been investigating the documents.

Leaked documents showed Dubai-based Gunes General Trading, which is alleged by the U.S. prosecutors of being a part of a network controlled by Zarrab that conducted hundreds of millions of dollarsâ worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under U.S. sanctions, processed $142m in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012.

The activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions, BBC reported.

Suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading

Banks based in the UAE rely on big U.S.-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments â a service known as âcorrespondent banking.â

Correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filing a document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR).

Among the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran.

SARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing.

The central bank told Standard Chartered that âthe case has been passed on to law enforcement authoritiesâ and that âaccounts were closed in September 2011.â

But Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to âcontinue its suspicious activityâ by âutilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks.â

In fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks â Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD).

The FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank.

In April 2013, the U.S. Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a U.S. government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran.

The FinCEN Files also suggest that Deutsche Bank continued to move money for people and companies deemed suspicious, as indicated by SAR filings from the bank, after it received a $258 million fine for violating U.S. sanctions in 2015, Deutsche Welle reported.

Deutsche Bankâs U.S. affiliate, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (TCA), submitted an SAR about a company with close ties to Zarrab to FinCEN in March 2017. The report states that the company, Nadir DÃ¶viz, which is involved in the gold trade, had more than $28 million transferred in its name.

Turkey âa high-risk countryâ

Deutsche Bank TCA filed its SAR because Nadir DÃ¶viz was being investigated for its involvement in a money-laundering scheme. The document says the transactions occurred between March 2016 and February 2017.

In its report, Deutsche Bank stated that the suspicious activities were intra-company payments dispersed between several Turkish banks. âThis SAR is being filed because the transactions originated from a high-risk country [Turkey], there were multiple large, round dollar transactions, and no commercial purpose was identified through the transaction details,â it reads.

One of these suspicious transactions was for $1.5 million from Nadir DÃ¶viz in Turkey to Nadir Gold in Dubai on Sept. 12, 2016. No reason was provided for the transfer.

Upon receiving a catalogue of detailed questions from ICIJ, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the information contained in the files is ânot new information to us or our regulatorsâ and that these issues date back to the years prior to 2016, adding that Deutsche Bank is âa different bank now.â

In his statement from Sept. 9, the spokesman emphasized: âWe acknowledged past weaknesses in our control environment, we apologized for this and accepted our respective fines. Most importantly: We learned from our mistakes, systematically tackled the issues and made changes to our business perimeter, our controls, and our personnel.â

The dates of the recorded Suspicious Activity Reports raise questions about how much Deutsche Bank knew about DÃ¶vizâs connection to Zarrab and the Turkish traderâs involvement in what turned out to be a gold for oil scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran.

Reza Zarrabâs billion-dollar scheme

When Iranian banks were cut off from the global SWIFT transaction system, the countryâs companies could no longer use international banking transfers to receive payment for oil and gas exports.

To get around the ban, Iran began collecting gold as payments instead. Reza Zarrab played a key role in this billion-dollar scheme to help Iran evade sanctions.

Zarrab was first indicted and arrested in December 2013 in Turkey, as part of a larger corruption investigation aimed at ministers in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Among the charges directed at him were bribing ministers, money laundering and gold smuggling.

According to a report by Turkish prosecutors at the time, Zarrab used Nadir DÃ¶viz for buying gold. Zarrabâs bagman Adem Karahan later told Turkish daily Cumhuriyet, that he was a cash courier for money going from Dubai to Turkey and from Dubai to Iran.

One of the companies he received money from was Nadir Gold LLC, a subsidiary of Nadir DÃ¶viz in Dubai. It is precisely these two companies that Deutsche Bank lists in its March 2017 Suspicious Activity Report to FinCEN.

At the time, the administration of President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan refuted all allegations against Zarrab and likened the investigation to a coup attempt, purging and arresting the prosecutors who initiated it. After two and a half months in prison, Zarrab was released.

In March 2016 Zarrab was arrested again, this time in the U.S. while on route to Disney World with his family. U.S. authorities accused him of money laundering, fraud and helping the Iranian government to evade the economic sanctions.

He pleaded guilty and later testified as a protected star witness in a trial against a manager of Turkeyâs Halkbank.

During this trial in November 2017, Zarrab claimed that Turkish government officials, including ErdoÄan, had allowed Halkbank to create a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold to help Iran get around U.S. sanctions.",am
227,"WASHINGTON â Diego Montoya Sanchez, 48, one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Colombian drug cartel and a former FBI Top Ten Fugitive, pleaded guilty today in Miami to drug trafficking, murder and racketeering charges, the Justice Department announced.
The pleas were announced by Acting U. S. Attorney Jeffrey H. Sloman for the Southern District of Florida, Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Thomas J. Harrington and Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

Montoya Sanchez appeared before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga in Miami, where he pleaded guilty in two pending federal cases. In the first case, which was indicted in the Southern District of Florida by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder.

In the second case, which was indicted in the District of Columbia jointly by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the Criminal Divisionâs Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS), Montoya Sanchez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for the guilty plea.

Following the decline of the Cali Cartel in the mid-1990s, the Norte Valle Cartel emerged to become Colombiaâs most prolific cocaine trafficking cartel. Based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. According to the SDNY/NDDS indictment, between 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States.

According to the statement of facts submitted in conjunction with todayâs hearing, Montoya Sanchez was a high-level Colombian drug trafficker for more than two decades. In the mid-1980s, Montoya Sanchez ran cocaine laboratories that served many significant traffickers. In the late 1980s, Montoya Sanchez expanded his organizationâs operations into smuggling plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. According to the statement of facts, by the early 1990s, Montoya Sanchez had switched to maritime smuggling. During the course of the next 15 years, Montoya Sanchezâs organization routinely smuggled cocaine loads between 1,000 and 6,000 kilos at a time using go-fast boats and fishing boats, among other methods.

By the late 1990s, Montoya Sanchez and Wilber Varela emerged to become the Norte Valle Cartelâs two leading kingpins. Mounting tensions between the Montoya and Varela organizations led to a two-year war between the organizations in which each targeted the otherâs members for murder. The Montoya-Varela war, which lasted from fall 2003 until fall 2005, resulted in hundreds of deaths, including those of innocent civilians.

At todayâs hearing, Montoya Sanchez admitted that his organizationâs practices included using violence and murder against people his organization feared were cooperating with law enforcement. Montoya Sanchez specifically admitted to the August 2003 murder of a one-time organization member who was believed to have been cooperating with authorities.

In May 2004, the FBI added Montoya Sanchez to its list of ten most wanted fugitives. On Sept. 10, 2007, Colombian authorities mounted an operation on a believed Montoya hide-out at a ranch in a rural area outside of Zarzal, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, and captured Montoya Sanchez hiding in a creek-bed approximately 700 yards from the ranch. Montoya Sanchez was extradited from Colombia to Miami on Dec. 12, 2008.

Jeffrey H. Sloman, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, stated, ""From the prosecution and conviction of the leaders of the Cali Cartel, to the conviction of Zeâev Rosenstein and an Israel-based Ecstasy network, to todayâs dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel, the Southern District of Florida has had a long and successful history in the war on drugs. We will continue to focus our energy, and the expertise of our prosecutors, to help our law enforcement partners stem the tide of drugs flooding our streets and poisoning our society.""

""Diego Montoya Sanchez was the leader of a dangerous, violent drug organization,"" said Thomas J. Harrington, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI. ""Outstanding cooperation between Colombia and the United States was key to his capture, the capture of others, and the effective dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel. The FBI and its law enforcement partners, both here and overseas, will continue to work together to eliminate other international organized crime threats.""

""The prosecution of Montoya Sanchez is a milestone in the efforts to dismantle the Norte Valle Cartel, one of the worldâs most powerful and dangerous drug-trafficking cartels,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York. ""Montoya Sanchezâs arrest and extradition marked the end of his long campaign of violence and corruption. We are grateful to our partners at the DEA and in the Colombian government for their tireless work in this investigation.""

""Montoya Sanchezâs path to the top of the Norte Valle Cartel was marked by decades of extreme violence. That path has now ended in a prison cell, where the man who personally helped direct multi-ton shipments of addictive and destructive narcotics into American cities and towns will be held for his crimes,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. ""This conviction is a major victory in the joint effort by Colombia and the United States to disrupt and dismantle these drug trafficking organizations, made possible through extensive cooperation with our partners in the Southern District of Florida, the Southern District of New York, the DEA and the FBI.""

""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" said Acting DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""Due to the skilled and brave work by the men and women of DEA and the Colombian National Police, justice has been served for the many victims of his cartelâs extreme violence and the tons of cocaine that ended up on American streets. Now he is in prison, no longer able to use his power to destroy others or benefit from his ill-gotten gains.""

Montoya Sanchez is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the case out of the Southern District of Florida. In January 2009, Montoya Sanchezâs brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder and was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, Montoya Sanchezâs brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States. They were sentenced to terms of 262 and 235 months in prison, respectively.

According to in-court statements during the hearing, Diego Montoya Sanchez agreed to serve a 45-year prison term for the crimes outlined in the court documents. Sentencing has been scheduled for Oct. 21, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. before Judge Altonaga.

The Southern District of Florida indictment is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office and was investigated by the FBI. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was the result of a multi-district investigation and is being prosecuted jointly by SDNY and NDDS, and was investigated by the DEA. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and NDDS Judicial AttachÃ©s in Bogota, Colombia provided significant assistance in both cases.

230,"MIAMI (Reuters) - The brother of jailed Colombian drug kingpin Diego Montoya, head of the Norte del Valle cartel, pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and obstruction of justice, U.S. prosecutors said.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the cartel and had primary responsibility for managing its finances, according to U.S. authorities.

He was arrested by Colombian authorities in January 2007 following a shootout and extradited to Florida last June.

U.S. prosecutors said the cartel often kept up to $20 million in cash from drug sales in stash houses maintained and overseen by Montoya Sanchez.

As the cartelâs money manager, he used drug proceeds to fund cocaine labs, pay employees including lab workers, drug couriers and security personnel, and invest in real estate and other businesses. In 2003, his role expanded to coordinating cocaine shipments, they said.

Diego Montoya, known as Don Diego or the Boss of Bosses, in Colombiaâs underworld, was extradited to Florida last month and is awaiting trial. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBIâs âTen Most Wantedâ list.

Sentencing for Eugenio Montoya Sanchez in Miami was scheduled for April 3.

232,"A Houston tech executive was charged on Thursday with hiding $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service in what federal prosecutors called the largest tax evasion case in U.S. history.

Prosecutors said the executive, Robert T. Brockman, had used a web of entities based in Bermuda and Nevis, as well as secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland, to hide income from the I.R.S. that he had earned on private equity investments over 20 years.

A 39-count federal indictment handed up by a grand jury in San Francisco detailed a complex scheme involving backdated records and encrypted communications with code names like âKing,â âBonefishâ and âSnapperâ as well as âthe house,â for the I.R.S.

The indictment said that Mr. Brockman, the chief executive of Reynolds and Reynolds, an Ohio company that makes management software for auto dealerships, used $30 million in income that he had hidden from taxation to buy properties named Mountain Queen and Frying Pan Canyon Ranch in Colorado and had spent an additional $29 million in unreported income on a yacht named Turmoil.",am
233,"SINGAPORE: The founder of Singapore oil trading company Hin Leong was charged in court on Friday (Sep 25) with abetment of forgery for the purpose of cheating, the police said.

Lim Oon Kuin, 78, now faces two counts of abetment of forgery, after the first charge on Aug 14.

The charge on Friday accuses Lim of instigating Hin Leong contracts executive Freddy Tan Jie Ren to forge an email purportedly sent by Hin Leong Trading to China Aviation Oil (Singapore) on Feb 26 in relation to a sale transaction of Gasoil 10PPM sulphur.

âThis email, along with the Inter-Tank Transfer certificate mentioned in the first charge, was submitted to a financial institution to secure more than US$56 million (S$77 million) in trade financing,â police said in a news release.

If convicted, Lim could face up to 10 years in jail and a fine for each charge.

Investigations are ongoing into the other offences allegedly committed by Lim, the police added.

Hin Leong, one of Singaporeâs largest independent oil traders, is now struggling to repay debts of US$3.85 billion.

Police confirmed in April that they were investigating Hin Leong, after the firm filed for bankruptcy protection amid a revelation from its founder that it had failed to disclose hundreds of millions in losses over several years.

Lim had directed the company to hide nearly US$800 million in losses from speculating oil futures over the years.

An affidavit signed by Lim cited the collapse in global oil prices â brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak and a price war among the oil majors â and a lack of hedging policies as some of the factors behind the companyâs financial distress.

The affidavit, which said Mr Lim was resigning immediately as director of the family-held company, did not specify over how many years the losses were incurred.

In May, Singaporean shipping firm Ocean Tankers, a unit of Hin Leong, applied to be placed under the management of a court-appointed supervisor.

234,"FORT WORTH (CBSDFW.COM) â A federal jury convicted Caleb Deason, 34, Wednesday on an indictment charging one count each of wire fraud and money laundering. It took two days in a trial before U.S. District Judge John McBryde, for the jury to convict the Fort Worth resident. Following the verdict, Judge McBryde remanded Deason into custody.

The government presented evidence at trial that Deason owned and operated CD Financial, a financial services business in Fort Worth. Deason was an agent of Transamerica Life Insurance Company from November 2006 through May 2012. In October 2011, Deason sold an individual a Transamerica policy with a death benefit of $1 million.

In January 2012, the insured died unexpectedly. Transamerica conducted extensive due diligence before agreeing to pay the policyâs death benefit to the insuredâs wife. However, Deason fraudulently changed the bank account and routing information and forged the beneficiaryâs signature on a Transamerica wire request form in order to divert the proceeds from the life insurance policy to his own personal use. He bought a 2010 Range Rover with the money, according to court records.

Deason faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in federal prison on the wire fraud conviction and 10 years on the money laundering conviction. Each count of conviction also carries a fine of up to $250,000. The 2010 Range Rover was administratively forfeited by the U.S. Secret Service.

235,"Morley, a former Labour environment minister, pleaded guilty last month to claiming more than Â£30,000 in bogus mortgage payments.

He entered two guilty pleas for false accounting relating to his home in Winterton, near Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, between 2004 and 2007.

Morley was sentenced at London's Southwark Crown Court.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Elliot Morley had already been suspended from the Labour Party and following his custodial sentence he has now been excluded from the party.""

Morley, who appeared flushed throughout the hearing, showed no emotion as the sentence was delivered.

The former Labour MP, the most high profile of a string of convictions since the expenses revelations rocked Westminster, pocketed Â£30,428 by claiming for a phantom mortgage and inflating the amount he was previously paying.

In total, he claimed Â£16,800 on a bogus mortgage and Â£15,200 after inflating the amount he was previously paying - for which he should have been entitled to only Â£1,572.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Saunders said Morley was guilty of ""blatant dishonesty"" and had ""thrown away his good name and character.""

He said: ""I am satisfied from the nature of the mortgage transactions and the correspondence that the excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable even in part by oversight.""

The prosecution overshadows a political career lasting more than 20 years.

As MP for Scunthorpe since 1987, former teacher Morley was one of Labour's most prominent voices on agricultural issues and the environment.

He was party spokesman on rural affairs and animal welfare from 1989 until the 1997 election victory, and served under Tony Blair as environment minister from 2003 to 2006.

But during that time he was claiming thousands of pounds more than any of the other MPs convicted.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court said Morley had ""engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system"".

The packed courtroom was told that between May 2004 and November 2007, Morley claimed significantly more than the value of his mortgage on his second home.

Despite paying off the mortgage of the property in 2006, he continued to claim Â£800 a month in fraudulent payments.

Between May 2004 and February 2006, he submitted 19 claims for ""excessive mortgage payments"" to which he was not entitled, worth Â£15,200.

Between March 2006 and November 2007 he submitted 21 second-home allowance forms totaling Â£16,800 for payments on a mortgage that did not exist.

Mr Justice Saunders said: ""The continuation of the claim for Â£800 a month after the mortgage had been redeemed can properly be described as blatant dishonesty.""

He added: ""The results of this case are tragic for the defendant and his family.

""He has thrown away his good name and good character.""

The court heard that under parliamentary expenses rules, Morley was entitled to claim only the interest element of mortgage payments on his second home.

This amount varied from Â£52 per month in 2004 to just Â£5.85 in February 2006, but throughout this period, Morley continued to claim Â£800 per month.

After receiving a letter from the Parliamentary fees office, Morley explained his behaviour as an ""embarrassing and inadvertent oversight"".

Jim Sturman QC, mitigating, said that once challenged Morley had paid back the full amount owed immediately.

He said: ""This is a tragic end to a lifetime of public service. He has done an enormous amount of good, often for no pay.""

He added: ""He's made a grotesque error of judgment

Mr Justice Saunders explained that Morley avoided a longer jail sentence despite claiming more money than other MPs convicted over the expenses scandal because of the lack of sophistication of his fraud.

He told the court: ""While this defendant is charged with obtaining more money than any other MP and over a long period, the degree of sophistication involved in carrying out the fraud was less than in some other cases.""

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ""Morley's jail sentence is justice for taxpayers who he cheated and stole from.

""The damage done by the MPs' expenses scandal is still being repaired and it will take time to restore the public's trust in the system, but this is another step down that road.",am
236,"Indonesia-born Hambali has been dubbed by the US Central Intelligence Agency the ""Osama Bin Laden"" of South East Asia.

He is believed to have been the operations chief for the shadowy militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and has been named as a key suspect in a string of bombings across the region.

The Islamic scholar, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, is wanted by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines in connection with a series of bomb attacks.

He is also accused of arranging a meeting between two of the 11 September hijackers with other al-Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000, and of being behind other plots to blow up Western targets in the region.

And he is further accused of connections with the suspects accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.

He has faced lengthy interrogation by the US following his arrest, in central Thailand in 2003. He has now been sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

JI is blamed for several attacks across South East Asia, including the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 attack on the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, which killed 12.

Analysts say JI wants to establish an Islamic state across Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and parts of the Philippines.

Indonesia's civilian intelligence service has linked Hambali specifically with the 2002 Bali attack.

He is thought to have been the major brains behind the operation, as well as the financial conduit.

Indonesia's Defence Minister, Matori Abdul Djalil, has said that Hambali was deputy to Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, JI's alleged leader.

Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was jailed in 2005 after he was found guilty of conspiracy in connection with the 2002 Bali attacks. He denies any links with JI.

Radical roots

Hambali was born in West Java in 1966, one of 13 children in a poor family.

As a teenager he became involved in a network of local groups known broadly as Jemaah Islamiah, which literally translates as ""Islamic community"". One of the men allegedly running the network was Abu Bakar Ba'asyir.

Hambali became involved in radical Islam as a reaction against the religious repression of the Suharto regime throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1985, when Hambali was aged 19, he sought exile in Malaysia, along with Mr Ba'asyir and other followers.

From there he travelled to Afghanistan in 1988 to fight as a Mujahideen guerrilla against Soviet occupation.

He returned to Malaysia in 1990, where he is believed to have travelled the country recruiting young Muslims to join a jihad (holy war) with the eventual aim of setting up a pan-Asian Islamic state.

Back in Indonesia, Suharto was overthrown in 1998, and Hambali is believed to have returned there in October 2000 to recruit more supporters.

On Christmas Eve that year, a series of bombs exploded almost simultaneously in nine Indonesian cities, many of them in churches. Eighteen people were killed.

A series of suspects have named Hambali - who returned to Malaysia a few days before the attacks - as the mastermind for the bombings.

A few days after the Indonesian bombs, 22 people were killed in a series of simultaneous bombs in the Philippine capital Manila. Philippine police say they have evidence that Hambali funded the attacks.

Philippine prosecutors have charged Hambali in absentia with involvement in a plot to smuggle explosives from the Philippines to Singapore in 2000, for an attack on US and Israeli targets, which was foiled.",am
237,"Ukraineâs state intelligence agency announced on November 18 that it had detained a man wanted by Interpol for the high-profile murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov in Russia 13 years ago. Russiaâs Interior Ministry on November 20 named the suspect as Magomed Dukuzov and said that Ukrainian authorities had apprehended him at its request, according to Russian news agency TASS.

Klebnikov, a New Yorker of Russian descent, was working as editor of Forbesâ Russian edition when he was gunned down outside its Moscow office on the evening of July 9, 2004. He was 41. Klebnikovâs colleagues and Russian media reported at the time that the motive may have been the journalistâs work investigating Russiaâs often violent criminal underworld and shady dealings of some of its powerful business elite.

Contacted by CPJ via email on November 20, Klebnikovâs brother, Peter, responded to news of the arrest, saying, âThe issue is really who is the mastermind, and in identifying, investigating and finding him, the Russian government has failed completely. So this arrest, while important, is still a bit of a sideshow.â

When the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced the arrest in a statement, it alleged that the Russian national of Chechen origin âparticipated in a number of assassinations, in particular, the editor-in-chief of the Russian edition of Forbes and the deputy chairman of the apparatus of the government of the Chechen Republic in 2001-2003.â

The agency said that after fleeing Russia, the suspect, whom it did not identify, allegedly became involved in âan organized criminal group, which in Ukraine was engaged in extorting money from private entrepreneurs.â

The SBU said that it is conducting necessary procedures, including those related to extradition. But it remains unclear if or when Dukuzov could be returned to Russia. When reached by phone, the SBU in Kiev declined to comment, citing procedure and telling CPJ to send a written request. CPJ did not immediately receive a response to that request. Russiaâs Interior Ministry did not return CPJ calls or an emailed request.

But Russiaâs Interior Ministry did confirm the arrest in a statement given to the Interfax news agency, in which it said the Russian Prosecutor-Generalâs Office had also been notified of Dukuzovâs capture.

Since Klebnikovâs murder in 2004, little progress has been made in the case. Three people charged in Russia in 2006, including Dukuzovâs brother, Kazbek, were later acquitted. Russiaâs Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial for Kazbek Dukuzov, but he fled before the proceedings could be held, Forbes reported.

Russian authorities sought Magomed Dukuzov in connection with the murder, the state news agency ITAR-TASS reported at the time. But he was not apprehended until last week.

The Klebnikov family said in a statement in 2006 that it viewed the Supreme Court ruling as a âhopeful sign for justiceâ but it was disappointed that âPaulâs killers and those who ordered this vicious crime are still at large.â

Peter Klebnikov told CPJ, â[The family] continue to expect justice, and are willing to cooperate with the Russian authorities but have received virtually no communication from them in recent months.â

Kazbek Dukuzov is believed to be imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates for crimes unrelated to the killing of Klebnikov, according to a 2013 Forbes report. The same report said that Kazbek Dukuzov had been blacklisted by the U.S. under the Magnitsky Act, Ð° law meant to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses.

The Russian Prosecutor-Generalâs Office has alleged that Chechen separatist leader Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, a subject of a critical book published by Klebnikov in 2003, mastermind the journalistâs killing.

The U.S.-born Klebnikov, who was of Russian descent, moved to Moscow in 2004 to launch the Russian edition of Forbes magazine. The first edition hit newsstands in April 2004. Two-and-a half months later, Klebnikov was gunned down outside the Moscow office.

Klebnikov is one of 38 journalists murdered in direct retaliation for their work in Russia since 1992. Of those, 33 were killed with complete impunity, according to CPJ research.",am

Four Chilean nationals working as American Airlines flight attendants were arrested this week on money laundering charges after federal agents say they were found with more than $22,000 in cash.

A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent was performing a routine check at Miami International Airport on Monday when he came across one of the flight attendants, identified as Carlos Alberto Munoz-Moyano.

According to an arrest report obtained by The Associated Press, Munoz-Moyano, 40, had arrived on a flight from Chile when he told the agent he only had $100 cash on him but the agent found $9,000. It was not immediately clear if the money was on him or in his luggage.

Three other women traveling with Munoz-Moyano were also arrested after reportedly telling federal agents they were smuggling the cash on behalf of someone else. It is unclear if the suspects were working on the flight when it arrived in Miami.

The arrest report stated that 55-year-old Maria Del Pilar Roman-Strick had $7,300 and 48-year-old Maria Wilson-Ossandon had $6,371.

Maria Pasten-Cuzmar also was arrested with no cash on her, but agents say the other three named her as the director of the illicit operation, the Miami Herald reported.

A spokesperson for American Airlines told Fox News on Wednesday: âWe take this matter seriously and are cooperating with law enforcement throughout their investigation.â

He also confirmed that they were all Chilean citizens and that the state would be handling the case after the U.S. attorney declined the case.

Organised crime boss Mario Riccio, 23, has been on the run since 2011 and faces a 16-year jail sentence for drug trafficking offences.

Police said Riccio, nicknamed Mariano, was the youngest fugitive on a list of around 100 considered the most wanted across Italy.

He is believed to be the head of the Amato-Pagato branch of the Camorra mafia clan. Based in Naples, Camorra is one of the most powerful Italian crime networks with influence extending to Rome and as far north as Florence, according to BBC News.

Video footage released by the police showed the arrest, reportedly at a house north of Naples where Riccio was staying with his wife and baby daughter, in which no attempt was made to resist officers.

According to local media reports, Marioâs home was fitted with an extensive video surveillance system that was disabled by police ahead of the raid.

In a separate operation, police arrested 29 suspected Camorra members based in Rome in relation to charges of fraud and extortion. They reportedly seized assets worth an estimated â¬400 million (Â£330 million).

As well as its links to fraud and drugs trafficking networks, the Camorra clan is reported to be involved in the illegal dumping of huge amounts of waste around Naples.",am

Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a âsyndicated criminal mafiaâ meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Policeâs revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But

investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;

571 Zengeza Township;

9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);

Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and

431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.

Four vehicles are also listed under assets that need explanation. Two combine harvesters, six tractors, two planters, three motorbikes and a boom spray were found at Chihuriâs farms at Shamva and Darwendale.",am

The Frankfurt headquarters of Deutsche Bank have been raided by prosecutors in a money laundering investigation.

Germany's public prosecutor alleged that two staff members have helped clients launder money from criminal activities.

Police cars were seen outside the tower blocks that house the headquarters of Germany's biggest bank.

Five other Deutsche offices in the city were searched in an operation involving about 170 police and officials.

Prosecutors are looking into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to ""transfer money from criminal activities"".

The investigation, which began in August, focuses on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018.

In 2016 alone, more than 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered in the British Virgin Islands, generating a volume of â¬311m, the prosecutors allege.

The investigation was sparked by revelations in the 2016 ""Panama Papers"" - an enormous amount of information leaked from a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.

What are the Panama Papers?

Other banks have been fined as a result of information contained in the Panama Papers.

Deutsche shares fell 3% after news of the raid emerged. The bank confirmed that police had raided several locations in Germany and that it was co-operating fully with the probe.

Paperwork and electronic documents were seized by officials during the raids on the bank's properties.

Deutsche has been connected with another huge money laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank.

Earlier this month, Deutsche confirmed that it was involved in processing payments for the Danish bank in Estonia.

An internal investigation by Danske found that about â¬200bn (Â£177bn) of payments were funnelled through its Estonian branch.

The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious.

Deutsche said it had terminated its relationship with Danske in 2015 after ""identifying suspicious activity"".

Fines and sanctions

Deutsche Bank has been sanctioned in the past for failing to tackle money laundering.

In September, Germany's financial regulator ordered the bank to take further action to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

It also appointed an independent auditor to monitor Deutsche Bank's efforts over three years.

In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined $630m (Â£504m) by US and UK regulators in connection with a Russian money laundering plan.

Under the scheme, clients illegally moved $10bn out of Russia via shares bought and sold through the bank's Moscow, London and New York offices.

The trouble with authorities comes at a time when Deutsche continued to face problems with its business.

242,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been rebuked by the U.S. Ethics Office after selling his stake in a film production company, which heâd promised to divest from, to his own wife, Louise Linton. Whoops!

The office said that, because of this, they wonât certify Mnuchinâs 2018 financial disclosure statement, according to a Thursday report in the New York Times. Mnuchin has promised to distance himself from the company, and wonât face any penalties for the sale.

From the Times:

Mr. Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then-fiancÃ©e, Louise Linton, as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary. Since they are now married, government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr. Mnuchin, potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China. [...]

Mr. Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms. Linton, an actress and producer. However, the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it.

Mnuchin isnât the first Trump official to be scorned by the ethics office. Just last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also told that his disclosure statement couldnât be certified because of an inaccuracy.

An attorney for the Treasury Department, Brian J. Sonfield, wrote a letter to the Ethics department this week explaining that Mnuchinâs sale had been cleared by the department, and that he believes the sale is âconsistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations.â

Mnuchin has now promised he will recuse himself from any business that could potentially have an impact on the production company.

But not having your financial records certified by the ethics office is a big deal, and extremely rare, according to the Times.

This isnât Mnuchinâs first ethics scandal. Last year, for instance, the Center for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington found that Mnuchin had âbetween the spring and fall of 2017, [taken] eight separate trips on military aircraft at a total cost of nearly $1 million.â

âThose records make clear that Secretary Mnuchin has legitimately earned a place in the roguesâ gallery of cabinet secretaries who have abused their all too easy access to military and other non-commercial aircraft for both business travel and what, upon closer inspection, appears to sometimes include personal travel,â the group said at the time.

Democrats pointed out that whatever Mnuchin says, his actions were a violation of his promise to divest from the company.

âBefore being confirmed by the Senate, he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L.L.C.,â Senator Ron Wyden, the highest ranked Democrat on the Finance Committee, told the Times. âRather than divest, he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then-fiancÃ©e and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage.â",am
243,"An investment conman is starting a prison sentence, six years after I warned about him.

Robert McKendrick finally came to grief after ignoring court orders by trying to hide his loot from
investigators.

I told in March 2013 how he was behind African Land, which was flogging investments in rice plantations in Sierra Leone with the slogan âWe harvest â you profitâ.

It offered juicy potential annual returns of 15%, but I told how you might be buying land that was over-priced and impossible to sell.

In fact, African Land sold more plots to investors than it owned â it had 3,000 acres but flogged 5,365.

Half of the money paid by investors disappeared into the pockets of Capital Alternatives Limited, which marketed the scheme, as commission.

In 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority stopped it from recruiting more investors and obtained a freezing order against McKendrick, who lives in posh Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

In 2015, African Land was put into compulsory liquidation in the High Court on the grounds that it was not regulated and so was operating illegally, a finding later confirmed by the Appeal Court.

In March last year, the High Court ordered that around Â£17million should be repaid by leading figures in the schemes including 60-year-old McKendrick and accomplices Renwick Haddow and Marcia Hargous.

Haddow, 50, is currently in the United States where he's been charged in connection with separate investment scams that allegedly defrauded victims of Â£28million.

The UK courts made a further freezing order requiring McKendrick to disclose all his assets and barring him from disposing of them.

Now heâs been jailed for six months for contempt of court after trying to siphon away funds.

âMr McKendrick misled investors and then, in contempt of court, failed to comply with court orders requiring him to properly account for the losses,â said Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority.

âThe FCA will ensure that defendants who mislead investors are held to account to the fullest extent possible.â

The regulator revealed how sneaky McKendrick had diverted rental income from his portfolio of buy-to-let properties to his wife.

Mr Justice Marcus Smith noted in sentencing that he had admitted and apologised for the breaches but they were âmany, varied and deliberateâ.

McKendrick was the main director and sole shareholder of African Land, also known as Agri Capital.

He was also involved in a second unlawful Sierra Leone scheme called Reforestation Projects, aka Capital Carbon Credits.

Now that he has finally come clean about his assets, the FCA will try to recover as much as possible for investors.

Anyone who invested in African Land or Capital Carbon Credits needs to complete a questionnaire and send documents by 31 March 2019 â more information here:

Investors in any of the four schemes who have not yet contacted the FCA should do so, even if they no longer have records of the investments.

The regulator also wants to hear from victims of a Â£33million land investment fraud.

Around 870 people were conned by Countrywide Land Holdings Limited, Regional Land and Consolidated Land UK Limited.

Sales reps lied about the development prospects of the greenfield sites, which turned out to be worthless.

In December, Countrywide Land ringleader 38-year-old James Maynard from Croydon, Surrey, was jailed for seven and a half years for conspiracy to defraud. He had fled to Cyprus and was caught after sneaking back into Britain.

244,"A Mexican cartel boss and 27 coconspirators have been charged with laundering more than $10 million in drug proceeds through a local clothing retailer, announced U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox.

In a 38-count superseding indictment unsealed today, a federal grand jury charged 28 individuals connected to Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion â one of Mexicoâs most violent and powerful drug cartels â with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and other financial, drug, and gun crimes, including conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, conspiracy to distribute heroin, and possession of a firearm by an undocumented alien.

âDrug cartels like CJNG wreak havoc across the globe, driving the spread of deadly drugs like meth and heroin,â said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox. âWeâre committed to tracking the money and disrupting these organizations by attacking their bottom line. By striking both the money and the drugs, we can more effectively impact the organization.â

âAddiction to drugs has many different faces. In this instance, the addiction to money and greed has met its consequenceâ, said Eduardo A. ChÃ¡vez, Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Dallas Field Division. âDespite CJNGâs efforts to disguise their illegal activities into our North Texas communities, the DEA will seek to starve it of every last drug dollar and achieve justice for all those involved.â

According to court documents, Jose Valdovinos Jimenez, a plaza boss who goes by âLa Rocaâ or âThe Rock,â allegedly conspired with his codefendants to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of methamphetamine and heroin across the Mexican border, distribute the drugs within the United States, launder the proceeds, and then transfer the money back to CJNG leaders.

In order to insulate himself from law enforcement activity and limit losses from law enforcement raids, Mr. Jimenez and other leaders of CJNG implemented a compartmentalized infrastructure, relying on couriers to smuggle the drugs across the border, recrystallization laboratories to purify drugs for sale, fortified stash houses to store the drugs before distribution, and a multi-level dealer network to handle the cash.

At Mr. Jimenezâs direction, mid- and upper-level dealers transported drug proceeds to Yoliâs Western Wear, a clothing retailer located on Buckner Boulevard in Dallas. The 23-year-old manager of Yoliâs, Ivan Noe Valerio, and his family members then counted the money and separated it into thousands of transactions, sending it through a money remitter back to CJNG in Mexico.

An indictment is merely an allegation of criminal conduct, not evidence. Defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.

If convicted, Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Valero face life in federal prison.

Other defendants charged in the scheme include:

Teodoro Valerio Perez (Valerioâs father)

An Indian court has sentenced the former head of Satyam Computers and nine others to seven years in prison in one of the country's biggest ever corporate scandals.

B Ramalinga Raju, who founded the software services giant, denied charges of conspiracy, cheating and forgery but admitted to accounting malpractices.

Raju was also fined $800,000.

The collapse of Satyam Computers in 2009 cost shareholders more than $2bn and rocked India's IT industry.

The BBC's Simon Atkinson in Mumbai says it is the biggest fraud at a listed company in India.

The convicted men are expected to appeal. The maximum sentence Raju faced was life in jail.

It's often described as India's Enron - and certainly the fraud at Satyam had much in common with the scandal that brought down the US energy giant in 2001. In both cases, the men in the boardroom systematically inflated profits in order to make their companies appear much healthier than they actually were.

Enron executives also concealed substantial debts. Both affairs, when they came to light, caused widespread shock and undermined confidence in the corporate sector. But the consequences of the Enron scandal were much greater. It caused the company to collapse. 20,000 employees lost their livelihoods and shareholders lost more than $70bn.

In the case of Satyam, the Indian government intervened to keep the company operating and engineered a takeover by the Mahindra Group. Shareholders still lost money, but the wider fallout from the scandal was much more limited.

image copyrightAP

Satyam was one of the biggest players in the booming Indian software market. The jobs of 50,000 Satyam workers were only saved after the government intervened.

Another Indian firm, Tech Mahindra, bought a controlling stake in the company in April 2009.

""All the accused have been convicted of almost all charges,"" prosecutor K Surender told reporters outside court,

Those convicted include two brothers of Raju.

Scandal timeline

January 2009: Raju resigns after admitting Satyam overstated profits for years. Company's stock suspended and government appoints new directors

February 2009: Federal CBI investigators take over investigation

November 2011: Supreme Court grants bail to Raju after the CBI fails to file charges in time

March 2012: Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam announce plans to merge, creating one of India's biggest software companies

'Riding a tiger'

The scandal emerged in January 2009 when Mr Raju, one of the pioneers in the Indian IT industry and Satyam's founder and then chairman, confessed to manipulating his company's accounts and inflating profits over many years to the tune of about $1.15bn.

In a letter to the board he claimed he had fudged the numbers in order to be in the top four of the Indian IT industry.

""The concern was that poor performance would result in a takeover,"" he told shareholders.

""It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.""

Prosecutors say that when the scam unravelled, it cost shareholders $2.3bn at today's rates.

The scam had been going on for nine years and the confession sent shockwaves across the industry.

Court papers filed by India's stock market regulator said that Mr Raju along with 13 other friends and family made about $400m in illegal wealth in the scam - by cashing in on a surging share price - offloading stakes in the company at a high price and making substantial profits despite knowing that accounts were overstated.

Raju was arrested in January 2009 and jailed before being bailed two years later. He also spent nearly a year in hospital being treated for hepatitis.

249,"The man who scored the winning goal when Hereford United famously knocked Newcastle out of the FA Cup in 1972 has been jailed for money laundering.

Ricky George, 72, was sentenced to two years and his son Adam, 40, has also been jailed, for 15 months.

The fraud involved the sale of a house without the knowledge or consent of the owner, Hertfordshire Constabulary say.

A third man, Charles Jogi, was also convicted of money laundering at St Albans Crown Court.

Adam George, 40, of Burleigh Road, St Albans received Â£120,000 into a business account from his father, Richard George, of Hadley Grove, Barnet who were both found guilty.

The money was then laundered through his own bank account and that of his father and Jogi, his father's friend.

When the buyer of the house found out he had been a victim of fraud and had lost Â£250,000, he had a heart attack, police say, from which he has ""thankfully"" recovered.

Jogi, 57, of Hill Close, Stanmore, was sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid work and was also given a community order.

Who is Ricky George?

Ricky George will always be known as the man who scored ""the other goal"" in that famous FA Cup third round replay win for non-league Hereford United over Newcastle United in January 1972.

This was back in the days when only a handful of games were televised every weekend - and even then, largely in black and white, only the recorded highlights.

And the goal that lives longest in the memory - and gets far more regularly shown - was Hereford's equaliser, Ronnie Radford's 35-yard rocket.

It was almost half an hour later before George had his own moment of fame, when he turned in the box to angle home a low right-foot shot across Newcastle keeper Willie McFaul.

His 103rd minute winner proved to be the highlight of his football career.

George would enjoy another major sporting highlight, 26 years on, as co-owner of Earth Summit, the the horse that won 1998 Grand National.

250,"JERUSALEM (AP) â Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on trial for accepting gifts from wealthy friends. But that has not stopped him from seeking another gift from a wealthy friend to pay for his multimillion-dollar legal defense.

The awkward arrangement opens a window into the very ties with billionaire friends that plunged Netanyahu into legal trouble and sheds light on the intersection of money and Israeli politics.

Netanyahu has asked an Israeli oversight committee to allow a 10 million shekel ($2.9 million) donation from Spencer Partrich, a Michigan-based real estate magnate, to fund his legal defense. Because Partrich also happens to be a witness in one of the cases, the committee has asked the countryâs attorney general for his opinion on the matter.

The request for financial aid from a friend is not illegal, and Israeli politicians have a long tradition of hobnobbing with wealthy Jewish supporters abroad. But to some, the optics of Netanyahuâs request are sketchy.

âIt is a problem that we have prime ministers who have ties to moguls,â said Tomer Naor, of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good governance group. âWhen the borders blur, you are blinded by the big money. You want more of it. Then all of a sudden the friend asks for a little favor and that poses a problem.â

Last month, Netanyahuâs trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in a Jerusalem court. It is scheduled to resume next month.

The accusations include accepting some $200,000 in gifts such as cigars and champagne from two billionaires, Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer.

Netanyahu is also accused of offering to push legislation benefiting powerful Israeli media moguls in exchange for more positive coverage in their publications. Netanyahu has said he is the victim of a witch hunt and called the bribery allegations baseless, saying accepting gifts from friends isnât a problem.

For his multimillion-dollar legal defense fees, Netanyahu has turned to both his wealthy American cousin, Nathan Milikowsky, and Partrich.

Netanyahuâs lawyers have asked a committee in the state comptrollerâs office, an oversight body, to allow him to accept 10 million shekels from Partrich.

The approval process revealed that Netanyahu had already received a $300,000 donation from Milikowsky as well as suits and cigars from Partrich, which he did not receive permission for and was ordered to repay, according to the committee. The committee also asked repeatedly for Netanyahu to declare his assets, which he did not do, according to official documents released by the committee.

Last year, it declined his request for the 10 million shekels from Partrich, saying it was inappropriate given the charges against him, the documents show. The committee said its decision was final.

But when a new committee was formed under Netanyahuâs hand-picked state comptroller, it took up the request again, citing âa significant change in circumstancesâ that arose following Netanyahuâs indictment in January, according to the committee documents. It is now awaiting the attorney generalâs opinion.

Netanyahu has already been allowed to accept a $570,000 loan from Partrich, the documents show. According to Naor from the good governance group, the money was meant to repay the Milikowsky money, which hasnât been repaid, he said.

A person close to Netanyahu said the Partrich aid would not cover all of Netanyahuâs legal fees, and that someone earning a public servantâs salary could not be expected to pay for the steep fees on his own. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnât authorized to discuss the legal fees with the media.

Netanyahu is believed to be a multimillionaire, thanks to best-selling books, real estate holdings and lucrative speaking fees while in the private sector. The countryâs attorney general is looking into a murky company share deal with Milikowsky that reportedly netted Netanyahu an exorbitant return on investment.

Multiple messages left with Partrichâs office were not returned. Netanyahuâs spokesman declined to comment.

Netanyahu has for decades socialized with the ultra-wealthy and his supporters say he has given up opportunities to amass great wealth to serve the country instead. But he and his wife have gained a reputation for enjoying the good life, repeatedly landing in hot water for misusing state funds.

The indictment against Netanyahu highlights his ties. A number of well-known billionaires appear on the list of 333 potential witnesses, including Milchan and Packer, as well as U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a longtime Netanyahu supporter, and Oracle Corp. co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison.

Witness number 283 is Partrich. According to the permits committee decision from last year, his relationship with Netanyahu stretches back to 1999, just as Netanyahuâs first term as prime minister was ending.

âEven if afterwards a personal friendship developed, at their core the ties between the two were formed as a relationship between a mogul and a senior politician,â the committee wrote.

According to a Channel 13 TV exposÃ©, Netanyahuâs confidants nicknamed Partrich his âair taxi in the U.S.â because of the many times he flew on Partrichâs private jet during the decade between stints as prime minister.

A resident of upscale Bloomfield Hills, near Detroit, Partrich sits on the board of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a group that runs programs for Israeli soldiers, and has donated more than $2 million to Wayne State University, where he has an auditorium named after him. He is an avid art collector and a fan of photojournalism.

According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Partrich purchased Netanyahuâs brotherâs half of the Jerusalem home they inherited from their father. The deal has raised questions about what interest an American business magnate would have in a relatively small transaction.

Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli journalist who wrote âBibi,â a Netanyahu biography, said seeking money from a wealthy friend is a way for Netanyahu to âdouble downâ on his claim that none of the gifts he received were wrong.

âThis kind of says he doesnât give a damn about the optics because he thinks he deserves it, and he doesnât think in any way this should be seen as illegal,â Pfeffer said.",am
251,"Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion.

A Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of failing to pay tax of around Â£584,000 on Â£2.2m of income he received after buying the failed chain for Â£1.

The court heard the 53-year-old spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday to the Bahamas.

Chappell's lawyers claimed he became ""utterly broke"" after BHS's ""pension problem exploded"" in 2015.

Mr Chappell controversially bought the retailer from tycoon Sir Philip Green that year, but the chain collapsed soon after in 2016. It led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.

Five issues at the heart of the BHS story
'I was in charge of millions, then I had nothing'

In sentencing, the judge said Chappell had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"".

""You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies,"" he said.

Simon York, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: ""This was deliberate theft from UK citizens. Chappell was a high-profile businessman who knew tax had to be paid on his income and profits but chose not to do so.

""That's money that should have been supporting our vital public services instead of funding his lavish lifestyle.""

'Struggling chain'

BHS, once one of Britain's best known retailers, was losing Â£1m a week and had a huge pension deficit when Chappell's consortium, Retail Acquisitions, bought it in 2015.

In his year of ownership Mr Chappell received Â£2.5m in payments from BHS , largely for consultancy fees provided by another of his companies, the bankrupt finance firm Swiss Rock Limited.

Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme.

However, on Thursday prosecutors condemned Chappell for spending large sums of money at a time when he should have been trying to save BHS.

""Chappell purchased the struggling retail chain for just Â£1 and was paid thousands of pounds in his new role, where he was tasked with avoiding more redundancies,"" said crown prosecutor Andrew Fox.

""Instead, while the company fell further into financial difficulty, he spent his new income lavishly on luxury breaks abroad and expensive yachts.""

'Reckless financial transactions'

The court heard Chappell, a former racing driver, also bought Â£11,000 worth of items from a gun and outdoor wear shop, including expensive Beretta firearms.

Prosecutors said HMRC repeatedly tried to chase down the missing funds, but Chappell ignored their requests, at one point going on a skiing break before asking for more time to pay the money when he returned home.

In his defence, Chappell argued he was too busy resolving issues with BHS to deal with the outstanding taxes that were due.

He had denied three charges of tax fraud.

Earlier this year Chappell was ordered to pay Â£9.5m into BHS pension schemes after losing an appeal.",am
252,"A former Commonwealth Financial Network advisor allegedly steered millions of dollars from clients to himself over 20 years of deception in a practice near the firmâs headquarters.

Gerald A. Eaton forged signatures, made false representations to Commonwealth and insurance companies and even used an account under his wifeâs first name and a fake last name to steal $3.7 million from at least 15 clients, according to the Massachusetts U.S. Attorneyâs office.

Eaton, 51, pleaded guilty to three felony fraud charges on Sept. 30.

Eaton âliquidated securities, as well as insurance policies, annuities and other insurance vehicles in client accounts, for the purpose of misappropriating the proceeds to his own personal use,â such as credit card payments and a home equity line of credit, according to the federal criminal information document filed by prosecutors.

âEach such sale was deceptive,â the document continues, âbecause it was neither authorized by, nor disclosed to, Eatonâs clients, was not for their benefit, and was done with the intention of converting the money to Eatonâs own use.â

Eatonâs attorneys didnât respond to a request for comment on the allegations. In a Sept. 1 letter to his lawyers, federal prosecutors stated that Eatonâs offense level for sentencing purposes will be lower because he âaccepted responsibilityâ for his crimes.

Commonwealth terminated him in October 2019 after nearly 25 years with the firm due to allegations of forgery and âwrongful taking of property,â according to FINRA BrokerCheck. Commonwealth says that upon learning of the conduct, the firm fired Eaton immediately, alerted the U.S. Attorneyâs office and worked closely with investigators in the case.

âJustice was served when Mr. Eaton admitted to his immoral and criminal behavior in court and pleaded guilty to the charges,â CEO Wayne Bloom said in a statement. âCommonwealth stands firm in its belief that financial advisors should be held to a high standard of trust, and will continually work to protect investor assets.â

Eatonâs Boston-area practice, Heritage Financial Group, was located in Acton, Massachusetts, which is roughly a half-hour drive to Commonwealthâs headquarters in Waltham. He earned a CFP certification and had built the practice to roughly 200 clients after nearly three decades in the industry, according to the charging document.

The long-running scheme often victimized seniors or clients in poor mental or physical health, investigators say. In one example alleged in the criminal information document, Eaton transferred an annuity worth $68,000 to an account in his wifeâs name by forging her signature and that of the victim, an elderly man, while falsely representing to the issuer that she was the clientâs granddaughter.

He also transferred an elderly womanâs $550,000 investment account to one he set up under the made-up name of âGaton,â according to investigators. To do so, he simply represented the incoming shares as a gift from the victim, investigators say.

Eaton pleaded guilty last month to wire fraud, mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. The SEC barred Eaton last month and FINRA barred him in November 2019 after his termination from Commonwealth.

In the letter to Eatonâs attorneys, federal prosecutors wrote that the âloss attributable to identifiable victimsâ is $3.78 million but that additional theft that isnât attributable to specific victims would likely push the total above $6 million.

The guilty plea requires Eaton to pay restitution to the known victims, and authorities will create a listing of them ahead of Eatonâs Jan. 26 sentencing hearing. Heâll also have to forfeit assets if he canât pay the victims, according to the court documents.",am

This is the conclusion of a fraud conspiracy prosecution against four former executives of retail software company, Torex Retail plc.

Additionally Mr Woodbridge has been disqualified from acting as a company director for three years and is to pay costs of Â£170,000 within 12 months.

One of the executives, Nigel Horn who was tried alongside Mr Woodbridge, was acquitted. Two others on the same indictment, Christopher Moore and Robert Loosemore, were not tried alongside Woodbridge and Horn as they had already pleaded guilty ahead of trial.

Torex Retail plc, a company involved in the retail software sector for touch-screen tills, was formed in 2004. The company, which was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, went into administration in June 2007 following the suspension of trading in shares of the company on 26 January 2007. The offences took place between 1 May 2006 and 26 January 2007.

The four defendants

Verdicts were returned over 19 and 20 June.

Found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of false accounting was:

Mark Gavin Woodbridge 42 of Kineton, Warwick. He was Group Financial Accountant for the Torex Retail Group of Companies.
Acquitted of conspiracy to defraud was:

Nigel David Horn 59 of Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire. Legal Director and Company Secretary. The jury could not reach a verdict. The prosecution is not to seek a retrial and the judge directed that he be acquitted.
The defendants who pleaded guilty ahead of trial to two counts of conspiracy to defraud are:

Christopher Edward Moore 58 of Hook Norton, Banbury. He was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February 2005 and replaced Mr Loosemore as Executive Chairman in September 2005. Mr Moore stood down as Chief Executive Officer in September 2006, but retained the post of Chairman.
Robert William Loosemore 47 of Oxford. He was Executive Chairman of Torex Retail Plc until September 2005. His association with Torex continued thereafter as a consultant and major shareholder.
Conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law (two counts)

Messrs Moore and Loosemore pleaded guilty and Mark Woodbridge was found guilty of conspiring to defraud the shareholders of the company between May and August 2006 by falsely inflating by Â£6.5m the cash at bank/revenue figures of the company's interim results which were published on 14 August 2006. In order to justify these entries the defendants created two false documents; a false distribution agreement worth Â£5m between the company and Mr Loosemore's private company, Magdalen Consulting Ltd; and a false ""Goodwill Deposit"" agreement worth Â£1.5m between the company and Mr Loosemore.

Messrs Moore and Loosemore pleaded guilty and Mark Woodbridge was found guilty of further conspiring between November 2006 and 26 January 2007 to defraud the shareholders of the company by creating a further false agreement between the company and Magdalen Consulting Ltd which purported to vary the original false distribution agreement in order to sustain the original fraud. Mr Horn was acquitted of this offence, the only one he faced.

Messrs Moore and Loosemore were sentenced in January this year: Moore to 30 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently. He was also ordered to pay Â£100,000 in prosecution costs and disqualified as a director for one year; Loosemore to 20 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently. He was also ordered to pay Â£50,000 in prosecution costs and disqualified as a director for one year. These sentences could not be previously reported.

False accounting contrary to s17 (1)(a) Theft Act 1968 (three counts)

Mr Woodbridge was found guilty of one count of false accounting between May and August 2006 by causing a further sum of Â£2m revenue to be falsely recognised in the company's interim financial statement. He was acquitted of two other counts.

Investigation and Proceedings

The investigation began on 29 January 2007. A number of residential property searches were undertaken and a business premises in Banbury were undertaken on 29 and 30 January 2007 and 21 March 2007. The defendants were charged in May 2011 and the trial of Woodbridge and Horn opened on 18 March 2013. Messrs Moore and Loosemore entered pleas on 11 January 2013 and were sentenced on 30 January 2013.

XN Checkout

Separate to these proceedings, but as part of the Torex investigation, two directors of a Torex subsidiary company XN Checkout Ltd, Edwin Dayan and Christopher Ford, were convicted in January 2011 of conspiracy to defraud Torex shareholders by causing false profits to be entered in the published 2005 year end accounts and the 2006 interim accounts, attributed to a fabricated agreement with pub chain outlet Mitchells & Butler.

255,"The UNâs housing advisor has accused private equity firms and one of the worldâs largest corporate residential landlords, Blackstone Group, of exploiting tenants, âwreaking havocâ in communities and helping to fuel a global housing crisis.

In a stinging critique of the role of private equity in the housing market UN rapporteur Leilani Farha and co-author Surya Deva, chairperson of the UN Working Group, singled out Blackstoneâs business practices â which they claim include massively inflating rents and imposing an array of heavy fees and charges for ordinary repairs â as having âdevastating consequencesâ for many tenants in countries around the world.

In a series of letters to Blackstone and government officials in Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the US, Farha and Deva accused private equity and asset management firms like Blackstone and its subsidiaries of undertaking âaggressive evictionsâ to protect its rental income streams, shrinking the pool of affordable housing in some areas, and effectively pushing low and middle-income tenants from their homes.

Blackstone disputed the claims. In a letter to Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstoneâs founder and CEO, obtained by the Guardian, the company said the UN report contained ânumerous false claims, significant factual errors and inaccurate conclusionsâ. And the company was âsurprised and disappointedâ that the UN would âsend a communication without verifying your assertions and providing appropriate contextâ.

Blackstone has, in recent years, acquired hundreds of thousands of homes in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, often through subsidiaries, making it one of the largest and most powerful global players in the housing investment sector.

In its reply, Blackstone claimed private equity had helped build the rental market at a time when countries around the world were facing housing shortages and abided by all relevant locals laws.

Farha said the commodification of real estate by private equity investors in recent years had made housing for many people increasingly expensive and precarious: âLandlords have become faceless corporations wreaking havoc with tenantsâ right to security and contributing to the global housing crisis.â

The authors also wrote formal letters to six countries, including the US, accusing them of failing to regulate corporate landlords and protect tenantsâ human right to secure housing: âWe remind all states that while gold is a commodity, housing is not, itâs a human right.â

The UN letter to the US government focuses on the way corporate landlords bought hundreds of thousands of ordinary family houses left empty after their owners defaulted on mortgage payments during the sub-prime crisis of 2008.

The firms were encouraged by US government agencies to acquire the heavily-discounted properties in part because they would bring homes back into use as local economies began to recover from the financial crash.

However, the need to maximize profits to repay investors typically led to a âconstant escalationâ of housing costs for tenants, primarily by hiking rents â in some cases by 30-50% â and ruthlessly pursuing eviction for non-payment. One corporation issued nearly a third of its tenants with eviction notices, the letter says.

The authors allege that a Blackstone subsidiary in the US, Invitation Homes, imposes charges for minor maintenance repairs and tasks such as removing insect infestations. She alleges that it imposes late rental payments of $100, even if they are just one minute late, or due to an error in Invitation Homesâ computer system.

In its reply, Blackstone said it was a small player in the US rental market, representing 0.5% of the nearly 16m single-family homes for rent in the United States, and that its customer satisfaction and retention rates were in fact higher than average.

Letters outlining similar breaches of housing rights and failure to regulate corporate landlords were also sent to Sweden, Czech Republic, Spain, Denmark and Republic of Ireland, each of which has seen large influxes of corporate rental investment in recent years.

Blackstone disputed these findings too.

Farha has made what she calls the âfinancialisationâ of housing the priority of her tenure as housing rapporteur since 2014, highlighting how the transformation of real estate into an asset class traded on global markets has triggered housing insecurity and homelessness crises in many cities around the world.

A paper she published for the UN two years ago noted how trillions of dollars of investments in hyper expensive apartment blocks in neighbourhoods of major cities from London to Vancouver had put housing beyond the reach of all but the rich, breaking up established communities, and fuelling soaring rents and evictions.

Farhaâs investigation into corporate landlordsâ treatment of tenants around the world is the subject of a new documentary, Push, which premiered this month. A sub-plot of the film is Farhaâs repeated but ultimately doomed attempts to secure a face-to-face meeting with chief executive Schwarzman to discuss its role.",am

Convicted

John Rigas' story is an increasingly common version of the typical American dream: from rags to riches to Federal court. Born in a rural New York town to Greek immigrant parents, Rigas was busing tables by the age of nine, joined the Army during World War II and earned a bachelor degree in management engineering, working nights at his family's small movie theater. Starting with a stake in a small cable TV franchise, the Rigas family built the Adelphia Communications Corporation, the fifth largest cable provider in the country, with 5.6 million customers in 30 states. But he was forced to retire as CEO in 2002 after being indicted for securities, bank and wire fraud; prosecutors charged him with the personal misuse of corporate funds and with hiding $2.3 billion in liabilities from investors. Rigas was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison; Adelphia filed for bankruptcy after admitting that the former CEO and his two sons had failed to record $3.1 billion in loans.

257,"Ayotzinapa: Debunking the âHistoric Truthâ

On July 7, the attorney generalâs office announced that the University of Innsbruck â a collaborating institute in the investigation into the 2014 kidnapping and disappearance of forty-three students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teaching College â had identified the remains of one of the bodies. Crucially, the remains were not found where the PeÃ±a Nieto government had insisted the killings occurred but nearly a kilometer away, in a ravine known as the Barranca de la CarnicerÃ­a.

Ayotzinapa marked the beginning of the end for PeÃ±a Nieto, not least because his government insisted on pushing a version of events, famously referred to as the â historic truth,â that was clearly self-serving. In its version, the students were apprehended by local police in the town of Iguala, turned over to the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos, and killed and burned in a garbage dump in the nearby town of Cocula. But this so-called âhistoric truthâ had always been hotly contested, not least by the families of the victims, and when an international team of experts known as the GIEI got too hot under the collar for the government with its own investigation, it was bounced out of the country in 2016.

On July 10, extradition proceedings were initiated for TomÃ¡s ZerÃ³n, the former head of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) who had been instrumental in formulating the âhistoric truth,â on charges of torture, forced disappearance, altering a crime scene, and the loss and concealment of proof in the case. ZerÃ³n had fled to Canada in March.

Meanwhile, new evidence based on fresh witness testimony alleges what the PeÃ±a administration always strenuously denied: that the army â specifically the 27th and 41st Battalions â was intimately involved in the detention of the students on the fateful night of September 26. Not only that, but a number of the members of these battalions were to have been directly on the payroll of the Guerreros Unidos in order to allow the transport of drugs, arms, and money throughout the region, as well as participating in the disappearance of the forty-three students.

In fact, it is suspected that one of the main reasons the army got involved in the first place was that the students had inadvertently seized a pair of buses that contained a shipment of heroin worth two million dollars.

These accusations put President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador (AMLO) in a delicate spot. From the outset of his administration, he has leaned on the armed forces for everything from the construction of the new Mexico City airport to the transport of gasoline to, recently, sending the navy to seize control of the nationâs ports in a bid to fight corruption there.

Historically answerable only to a series of complicit presidents, the Mexican army is among the most hermetic of institutions, with its own court system and a secretary of defense who has always been an active-duty soldier. Whether AMLO will be able to pry it open to allow the corruption in its own ranks to be investigated will be a stiff test for his resolve.

Most urgently, it is Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto who is feeling the heat. On July 20, he celebrated his 54th birthday in seclusion, without the fanfare and hoopla of previous years. Itâs not without irony that one hopes he enjoyed it. His coming year stands to be significantly less pleasant than the last.",am
258,"Brazil's attorney general charged President Michel Temer on Thursday with obstruction of justice and leading a criminal organization, according to a press release on the attorney general's website.

It's the latest round of corruption allegations against Temer, who survived an impeachment vote in August. Six other members of Temer's political party, PMDB, were also named in the charges filed by attorney general Rodrigo Janot.

In a statement posted on its website, Temer's office dismissed the charges as ""absurd"" and said they were an attempt by the attorney general to ""cover his own faults."" The statement added that ""the truth will prevail"" and Temer will be able to focus on governing.

Janot said the latest charges stem from plea-bargain testimony given by Joesley Batista, who turned himself in to authorities on Sunday. Batista is the former chairman of JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company. The Brazil-based company has admitted to doling out $150 million in bribes to some 2,000 politicians over a decade.

According to Brazilian state media, Batista recorded a phone call between himself and Temer last spring in which Temer allegedly suggested giving hush money to the country's former house speaker, Eduardo Cunha, to buy his silence. Attorney General Janot on Thursday brought new charges against Cunha, who is now in prison for money laundering, among other charges.

Batista gave his testimony implicating Temer last spring in exchange for the plea agreement. This week, he and his brother Wesley were charged with insider trading, which prompted the government to suspend the plea deal, state media reported. This week, their lawyers called those charges ""unjust.""

In speeches and statements, Temer denied that he suggested bribing Cunha and said the phone recording was doctored to make him look bad.

The new charges could be a blow to Temer's pro-business agenda, which includes tax and pension reform. Earlier this month, finance minister Henrique Meirelles told the Wall Street Journal he expected those reforms to become law soon.

It also marks the latest twist in a period of deep corruption in Brazil. Temer's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year on charges of manipulating the government's budget. Rousseff denied the charges.

Brazil's wildly popular former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who preceded Rousseff, was sentenced in July to nearly 10 years in prison. He is appealing the case.

Temer will only face trial if two-thirds of the country's lower house of Congress votes to suspend him. His term ends at the end of 2018.

More broadly, a widespread bribery ring involving Brazilian politicians, the state-run oil company Petrobras and Brazil's largest construction company Odebrecht, helped plunge South America's largest nation into its worst recession on record. The recession officially ended earlier this year but the recovery has been anemic.",am

A man has been jailed for almost four years after trying to board a flight to Dubai with Â£1.5m in his luggage.

Mohamed Imran Khan Sathar Khan, 35, was arrested at Stansted Airport on 29 August after Border Force officers found four of his holdalls were stuffed with Â£10 and Â£20 notes.

Sathar Khan, who claimed to be living in Ilford, east London, denied all knowledge of the money.

He was jailed for three years and nine months at Chelmsford Crown Court.

Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA), who charged Sather Khan with two money laundering offences, found he had made several trips to Dubai before being caught.

The money was forfeited under Proceeds of Crime legislation.

Matt Rivers, from the NCA, said it was ""a significant seizure"".

Taylor Wilson, assistant director of the Border Force at Stansted Airport, said: ""By making this detection, Border Force officers have taken a substantial quantity of criminal cash out of circulation and ensured it will be returned to the public purse.

""Depriving criminals of their wealth disrupts organised crime and we will continue to work with law enforcement partners like the NCA to both bring offenders to justice and to hit them in the pocket.""

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Daveyâs bank account.

All dealings with the âsolicitorâ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

At one point, Davey told a mother that she had won full custody of her children and had been awarded Â£65,000.

As a result of Daveyâs deception, the women were not represented in court and both their cases were put in âsevere jeopardyâ.

According to the police statement, Davey also posed as a police officer and a probation worker and convinced a woman he was in love with her in order to extort money. The court heard that Davey extorted more than Â£7,000 in total from his victims.",am

262,"Two months before one of the world's largest data leaks, dubbed the Panama Papers, was made public on Sunday, Brazilian prosecutors accused the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at the center of the leak, of corruption. (The firm, whose leaked records span 40 years and make up the Panama Papers, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), issued a statement to the ICIJ denying any unlawful activities. In addition, it stated that ties to offshore companies is not an implication of wrongdoing.)

On January 27 Brazil's Federal Police, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash (""OperaÃ§Ã£o Lava Jato""), accused the firm of helping clients create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. Prosecutors alleged that the firm was using real estate company OAS Empreendimentos ImobiliÃ¡rios S/A to help cover up money made in the criminal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Six temporary arrests were made and 16 search warrants were issued. Lawyers representing those arrested denied any wrongdoing or irregularities. FORBES has been unable to reach the firm for comment. Aside from its office in Brazil, the firm also has branches in 40 other cities.

According to the ICIJ, which on Sunday began sharing information on the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca's cofounder RamÃ³n Fonseca, an adviser to Panama's president, ""took a leave of absence as presidential adviser in March after his firm was implicated in the Brazil scandal and ICIJ and its partners began to ask questions about the law firmâs practices.""

At least 29 billionaires and former billionaires have been outed for allegedly having ties to offshore wealth (see story here). No Brazilian billionaires have been named so far. According to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, several current and former Brazilian government officials belonging to almost every political party are allegedly implicated. Among them, JoÃ£o Lyra, a former deputy and once Brazil's richest parliament member according to the ICIJ, was named for not disclosing an offshore holding or Swiss bank account. According to Brazilian law, individuals are allowed to have offshore accounts as long as they are registered in the country for tax purposes. Lyra has not commented on the leak. IdalÃ©cio de Castro Rodrigues de Oliveira, a Portuguese business executive accused of allegedly supplying cash used to bribe Eduardo Cunha, the president of Brazilâs Chamber of Deputies, was also named for creating offshore companies right before the alleged bribe took place. De Oliveira didn't comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.

In addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz GalvÃ£o family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo PetrÃ³polis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz GalvÃ£o released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.

Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as âLulaâ (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and refuses to step down, claiming that she is the victim of a coup attempt by rivals.",am

A milkman has been sentenced after bags of cash totalling Â£180,000 were found stashed in a secret compartment of his car.

Daniel Brown was arrested in February 2018 but told officers had no idea what was in the bags, Manchester Crown Court heard.

The 45-year-old, of Mulberry Close, Ormskirk, later pleaded guilty to possessing criminal property.

He received a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

A search of his car as part of an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) recovered bags of cash and a mobile phone, the court was told.

Because he had money problems, and was desperate, he agreed.

Maqsood Khan, of the Crown Prosecution Service's Fraud Unit said the defendant had ""dipped his toe into the murky world of organised crime and is paying the price.

264,"Australian casino operator Crown Resorts has revealed it is being investigated for possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

The company told the Australian Stock Exchange it had been contacted by the country's financial crime regulator.

Crown has casinos in Melbourne and Perth, and is building one in Sydney.

If breaches are proven, it could face millions of dollars in fines and threats to its casino licences.

The company is already facing separate inquiries into its licences and questions over how it brought in high-roller gamblers, largely from China.

Last year, Nine Entertainment newspapers reported allegations that Crown Melbourne had business ties to tour operators with suspected crime links in Asia.

The regulator, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), is yet to comment on Monday's announcement or whether it is related to those allegations.

In a statement, Crown said Austrac had raised concerns after reviewing its Melbourne casino's ""management of customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons"".

They included ""concerns in relation to ongoing customer due diligence"" and complying with ""an anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing programme"".

Crown added it would co-operate with the investigation. At one point on Monday, its shares were down by more than 9%.

U.S. Attorney William Hochul Jr. confirmed that the U.S. State Department has issued the designation for Abd Al-RaâOuf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza under Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.

Hamza and three co-conspirators participated in an armed attack in Khartoum, Sudan on January 1, 2008 which led to the death of Granville, who was serving as a U.S. Diplomat at the time. He was working on democracy and governance programs while serving with the U.S. Agency for International Development. A U.S. Embassy staff member was also killed in the attack.

âAs the office that is leading the criminal investigation into this terrible crime, this is certainly welcome news,â Hochul said, of the designation. âThis action puts the world on notice that anyone aiding this individual will, along with the defendant, eventually be brought to justice.â

The decision to issue the terrorist designation means two things. First, all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hamza has any interest is blocked and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Additionally, American citizens are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with a designated terrorist.

Hamza and his co-conspirators were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Sudanese criminal court in 2009. All four escaped from a maximum security prison the following year, killing a Sudanese police officer during the escape. Hamza was eventually recaptured and is currently in prison in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.",am
267,"The ascent of Bashar al-Assad in 2000 paved the way for a new rampant class of corrupt businessmen â often sons or relatives of the governing apparatus which inaugurated the Assad era in Syria in 1970. Thus, his fellow Alawite maternal cousin and close confidant, Rami Makhlouf (b. 1969) was able to become the wealthiest man in the country. Makhloufâs privileged position was well-known and became a lightning rod for popular rage and discontent during the 2011 Syrian uprising. Makhlouf used corruption, intimidation and governmental ties to expand his businesses and amass a fortune even without secrecy. Moreover, his predatory-capitalistic approach proved detrimental for the economy itself, limiting the Syrian middle class, as he earned the nickname of Mister Five â or Ten â percent, depending of the interest percentage he received on every loan his companies would make. In the analysis which follows, a focus on this particular player highlights the new opportunities for predatory capitalism which have been unearthed due to the Syrian war economy that emerged beginning in 2011.

Sanctions and business shift
In the March 2011 demonstrations held in the city of Daraâa, Syrian citizens raged against the magnate as well, in addition to chanting slogans against the regime, and burned a local Syriatel branch. This was not coincidental. [2] It was, in fact, an indicator that Makhlouf, despite his attempt at maintaining a low public profile, had indeed been included by the Syrian opposition as part of what they viewed to be an evil triumvirate responsible for having led the country to disaster. Makhlouf controlled several mafia-style businesses and monopolies which had worsened the economic conditions of many Syrians. The other members of the trio are Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was blamed for mismanaging the government and for being an elitist, and his brother Maher, who controlled Syriaâs brutal security apparatus.

On the international stage, Makhlouf had already been discredited and sanctioned; in 2008 the US Treasury National Department designated him as âresponsible for having benefitted from public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.â [3] On May 11, 2011, a few weeks after the beginning of the uprisings, the European Union sanctioned the billionaire as well by forbidding his travel to EU countries and freezing his accounts therein. Alongside Makhlouf, twelve other members of Assadâs inner circle were blacklisted, including Maher. [4]

Despite Makhloufâs occasional indication of his intention of exiting his businesses, [5] it turns out that, on the contrary, he was too dependent on the fate of the regime to abandon the country or to passively accept the events that followed the 2011 uprising. In fact, he took full advantage of the horrifying conflict to further strengthen his grip on Syria and benefit from the new war economy that had begun to develop.

Now that many parts of the country have been destroyed, those close to the regime aim to capitalize on rebuilding projects. Most recently, thanks to a government decree, a spin-off of Makhloufâs Damascus al-Cham Holdings joint-capital investment firm is positioned to control a planned massive real estate project â including a large new shopping mall â in place of the slums of Damascus. This is specifically designed to attract a new elite class which will be loyal to the regime. [6] Moreover, Syria expert Joshua Landis noted recently that Makhloufâs firm has received a license for Syriaâs first mortgage finance operationâgiving the Makhlouf-Assad family even deeper control of the economy in addition to another mechanism for shaping the demographics of Syriaâs housing landscape. [7]

Illegal trade
In order to finance Assadâs repression and build his own empire, Makhlouf smuggled assets from Lebanon and Europe, in particular by monopolizing the tobacco trade. On May 25,2011 Makhlouf managed to receive a shipment of 90 million cigarettes distributed in 9,000 cases by IBCS, the Middle-Eastern partner of Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The cigarettes were loaded in the port of Limassol, Cyprus, a member state of the EU. Just four days earlier the EU had decided to impose sanctions on Makhloufâs assets. Makhlouf succeeded in bypassing the sanctions thanks to his Cypriot citizenship, which had been given to him a few months prior by its government, and which was later extended to the rest of his family. [8] The tobacco shipment was unloaded in Makhloufâs stronghold of Lattakia port and distributed to duty-free shops under his control. [9]

The cigarettes were used as a source of income or even as an alternative currency to pay the regime-allied shabiha and other irregular battalions loyal to Damascus. [10] The shabiha â literally âghostsâ â started operating in the late 70âs, during the Syrian intervention in Lebanon. Often possessing special ties to the regime, they terrorised the local population and ran tobacco and drugs in and out of occupied Lebanon. [11] Rami Makhlouf and Maher al-Assad used the shabiha to do the governmentâs âdirty workâ at the start of the uprising â beating, arresting, torturing, and killing civilian protesters who criticized the government.",am

The son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has denied allegations that he laundered public funds, including via a chocolate shop he co-owns in Rio.

FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro's shop was one of 24 properties raided by anti-corruption investigators earlier this week.

Other properties owned by him, his former advisors and members of President Bolsonaro's ex-wife's family were also raided.

FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro, now a senator, was a Rio state deputy from 2003 to 2018.

The investigation relates to the alleged practice of ""rachadinha"" - diverting the salaries of non-existent employees, which is alleged to have taken place during this period.

On Thursday, President Bolsonaro - who was elected after vowing to end corruption - declined to comment, saying: ""I can only answer for myself.""

Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro?

Last month the president launched a new political party, the Alliance for Brazil, which he said would be dedicated to fighting corruption and advancing Christian values. FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro would be the party's vice-president, he said.

What happened in the raids?

Brazilian media have been reporting details of the investigation that were contained in a document allegedly leaked from the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor's office.

In a YouTube video, FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro criticised the supposed leak, denied all the allegations and said he was being persecuted.

""Now they are attacking my chocolate shop, which was bought with my wife's and my own resources,"" he said.

""If I wanted to launder money, would I open a franchise which is subject to external checks by the franchiser and auditors?"" he added.

He also rejected accusations that he had laundered money through the purchase of two apartments in Rio's Copacabana area.

""I bought them from a group of American investors that was leaving Brazil and obviously I was able to negotiate a better price because it was two properties from the same seller. Can't I buy it cheaper? Do I have to pay more to avoid suspicion?"" he said.

His lawyer Frederick Wassef has asked Brazil's Federal Supreme Court to suspend the investigation, Brazilian media reported.

Mr Wassef said the senator had reacted to news of the searches ""with surprise, but with complete peace"".

One of FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro's former aides, FabrÃ­cio Queiroz, is being investigated on suspicion of helping skim ghost workers' salaries, the Rio state prosecutor's office said in a statement.

269,"Miami â Today, a federal judge in Miami sentenced 43-year-old Philip Righter, of California, to five years in prison for running a scheme in which he tried to dupe prominent art businesses, including one South Florida gallery, into spending millions of dollars on forgeries of works by renowned contemporary artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Ariana Fajardo Orshan, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.

Righterâs scheme was this: He would buy art forgeries at online marketplaces and auction sites. Once he had the forgeries, Righter tried to make them appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity. For example, he created letters that appeared to be from âThe Estate of Keith Haringâ and the âAuthentication Committee of the Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.â In fact, they were not. Righter designed and purchased embossers bearing the names of the estate and foundation for Haring and Basquiat. He stamped the forged letters with the custom embossers, trying to enhance the look of legitimacy. Righter forged the signatures of representatives of the estate and foundation on the letters.

Righter also created elaborate backstories to establish the âprovenanceâ of the forged artworks. He forged documents to show links between the artworks, Righterâs family, a Wisconsin art museum, and a prominent New York City gallery. Righter told one prospective buyer that he had donated a number of his artworks to his Ivy League alma mater, which was a lie.

Once Righter had the forged artworks, forged documents, and false stories in place, he offered, directly and through brokers, to sell the forged works to galleries, auction houses, and others. In one instance, after a Miami gallery owner showed interest in some work, Righter (who was in Los Angeles) shipped a number of the forgeries to South Florida, where the FBI ultimately seized them. Righterâs asking price for these forgeries: $1,056,000. He directed the gallery owner to wire the money to Righterâs bank account.

Agents with FBIâs Art Crime Team uncovered Righterâs coast-to-coast scheme, which resulted in the filing of two federal cases against him -- one in the Southern District of Florida (the âMiami caseâ) and one in the Central District of California (the âLos Angeles caseâ). The Los Angeles case was transferred to Miami, where the two prosecutions were consolidated for plea and sentencing proceedings.

On March 11, 2020, Righter pled guilty to two counts in the Miami case: mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. (Case No. 19-20370-CR-Cooke). Today, Righter pled guilty in Miami federal court to three counts in the Los Angeles case: wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax fraud. (Case No. 20-20164-CR-Cooke). United States District Court Judge Marcia G. Cooke sentenced Righter to five yearsâ imprisonment in each case. The sentences will run concurrently. A consolidated restitution hearing is set for September 30, 2020, at 10 a.m.

U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the investigative efforts of the FBIâs Art Crime Team. Assistant United States Attorney Christopher Browne prosecuted the Miami case.

270,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai (Azmarai), a senior Al-Qaâida official, and Jamia Taleem-Ul-Quran-Wal-Hadith Madrassa, also known as the Ganj Madrassa, a school in Peshawar that serves as a training center and facilitates funding for al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. The activities of the Ganj Madrassa exemplify how terrorist groups, such as al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban, subvert seemingly legitimate institutions, such as religious schools, to divert charitable donations meant for education to support violent acts. Todayâs action is the first designation of a madrassa that is being abused by terrorist organizations. This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan.

âTodayâs action strikes at the heart of the financial and logistical support network that abuses charitable donations and provides essential services for various terrorist groups including al-Qaâida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. These networks provide the fighters, training, and supplies for these terrorist groups to carry out their acts of violence against coalition forces and civilians alike,â said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. âWe will continue to work with our partners around the world to dismantle these terrorist networks, especially those that try to conceal their sinister activities behind critical community organizations like madrassas.â

During his long tenure with al-Qaâida, Azmarai has held a number of important positions. He is al-Qaâidaâs leader in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, Pakistan, and has been a significant financial facilitator for the group, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of its leadership and operations. Azmarai has also acted as a courier for al-Qaâida officials and has managed logistics for family members of senior al-Qaâida leadership, including Usama bin Laden.

Treasury today also designated the Ganj Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is controlled by designated al-Qaâida facilitator Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah. Shaykh Aminullah was designated by both the United States and United Nations (UN) in 2009 for providing material support to al-Qaâida and the Taliban.

The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training center where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalized to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities. In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers. Shaykh Aminullah has directed donations provided for the school to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which use the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan.

The Ganj Madrassa was designated today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorist and their supporters, for being controlled by Shaykh Aminullah and for providing financial and material support to Lashkar-e Tayyiba and the Taliban. Azmarai was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 for acting on behalf of al-Qaâida.

As a result of todayâs designation, any assets these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.

Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai

In addition to his financial activities on behalf of al-Qaâida, Azmarai has been active in multiple other facilitation duties for al-Qaâida. As of early 2012, Azmarai facilitated the procurement of secure areas in Pakistan for al-Qaâida to house militants and store vehicles. Azmarai has frequently acted as a courier within Pakistan for al-Qaâida leaders and other al-Qaâida facilitators. As of early 2003, Azmarai was a courier between al-Qaâida cells in Pakistan and the Persian Gulf and, as of late 2002, was a courier for senior al-Qaâida operational planner Khalid Shaykh Muhammad.

Azmarai's facilitation duties on behalf of al-Qaâida have also included providing logistical support to al-Qaâida members and their families. As of 2011, Azmarai assisted al-Qaâida's administrative manager with managing the care of important al-Qaâida members' families, including facilitating their finances, housing, and medical care. In 1999, Azmarai assisted in making logistical arrangements for al-Qaâida members and their families in Karachi, Pakistan. Azmarai was also specifically responsible for providing support to members of now-deceased al-Qaâida leader Usama bin Laden's family. Bin Laden's son-in-law selected Azmarai in late 1999 to look after bin Laden's family and, in mid-2000, Azmarai began working directly for bin Laden's family, facilitating their travel, lodging, and medical needs. From late 2001 through early 2002, Azmarai was responsible for bin Laden's family members in Karachi. In mid-2002, Azmarai worked for bin Laden's son, now-deceased Saad bin Laden.

Ganj Madrassa

Under Shaykh Aminullahâs leadership, the Ganj Madrassa has trained and harbored Taliban fighters who have subsequently been dispatched to Afghanistan. As recently as early 2013, Shaykh Aminullah was recruiting for Lashkar-e Tayyiba at the Ganj Madrassa and, as of late 2012, was hosting al-Qaâida operatives there.

Shaykh Aminullah has provided assistance, including funding and recruits, to al-Qaida. In addition, he directs donations received by the Ganj Madrassa to jihadist fighters battling coalition forces in Afghanistan and also uses the money to train madrassa students to become Taliban fighters. Shaykh Aminullah frequently travels to the Gulf to obtain charity donations on the madrassaâs behalf.

271,"A solicitor jailed last year for three money laundering offences has been struck off the roll. In an outcome agreed with the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, Ross Ian McKay accepted he should be banned after he was jailed for seven years for helping fraudsters develop a multi-million-pound property portfolio.

The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal also heard McKay worked as an in-house solicitor for a company which converted money introduced by a convicted drug dealer.

McKay, from Handforth in Cheshire, was sentenced in January 2019 at Manchester Crown Court after it was heard he was gangstersâ âgo-toâ solicitor who would carry out property transactions without asking questions about where the money had come from.

Investigators said following his sentence that McKay was fully aware that transactions were being made to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

The tribunal heard that the sentencing judge, His Honour Judge Smith, said McKay worked for two clients on total purchases worth more than Â£7.3m and assisted them in the acquisition of criminal property.

McKay was responsible for more than 80 property transactions for various criminals, all of whom were subsequently convicted of offences including money laundering and fraud.

The court had heard that deposits were put down on property where the source of funds was disguised and mortgage applications used nominees instead of the names of the legitimate purchasers.

McKay, admitted in 2004, acknowledged his conviction and did not argue against his striking off. The tribunal said he had caused significant harm to the reputation of the profession and its attempts to combat money laundering. Breaches of the law happened over several years and he had direct control over matters during this period. He must also pay Â£1,450 in costs.",am
272,"(CNN) Maurice Fayne, who stars in VH1's ""Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,"" has been arrested and charged with federal bank fraud after misusing funds from a Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loan, federal officials said Wednesday.

Fayne, also known as ""Arkansas Mo,"" runs a corporation called Flame Trucking, and he submitted a PPP loan application for the company on April 15, stating that the business had 107 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1,490,200, according to an affidavit for the criminal complaint.

Flame Trucking asked for a loan of $3,725,500 and certified that the loan proceeds would be used to ""retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments, as specified under the Paycheck Protection Program Rule,"" the affidavit alleges.

United Community Bank ultimately funded the loan for $2,045,800 in late April, according to the affidavit.

Fayne then used more that $1.5 million of the funds to buy $85,000 in jewelry, including a Rolex watch, a diamond bracelet, and a 5.73 carat diamond ring for himself, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia said in a release.

Fayne also leased a 2019 Rolls-Royce Wraith, and paid $40,000 for child support, according to the statement.

""At a time when small businesses are struggling for survival, we cannot tolerate anyone driven by personal greed, who misdirects federal emergency assistance earmarked for keeping businesses afloat,"" said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, in the statement.

An attorney for Fayne pointed to the ""considerable confusion"" about PPP guidelines when asked by CNN about the charges against her client.

""There has been considerable confusion among small business owners about PPP guidelines -- particularly around the question of whether and how business owners are permitted to pay themselves a salary or take an owner's draw. I hope these issues to be better fleshed out in the weeks and months to come,"" attorney Tanya Miller said in a statement.

""For obvious reasons, we cannot try these allegations in the media,"" Miller said. ""We will provide the appropriate response in the proper forum once all the information has been provided to us.""

The PPP loan program from the federal government aims to help small businesses and their workers survive during the Covid-19 pandemic. The loans are for businesses with 500 or fewer employees to pay workers' salaries, rent and utility costs.

In an interview with federal agents last week, Fayne said he used the PPP loan to ""pay payroll and other business expenses"" of the company, and ""Fayne expressly denied that he used any of the PPP loan proceeds to pay his personal debts,"" according to the court document.

Federal agents searched Fayne's residence in Dacula, Georgia, May 11, where they also discovered about $80,000 in cash, including $9,400 that Fayne had in his pockets, court documents say.

Fayne told the agents that he had used the PPP loan to buy the jewelry, and when asked if he had used any of the loan on the Rolls- Royce, he said, ""Kinda, sorta, not really,"" according to the affidavit.

""Fayne told the agents that he believed he had the right to use part of the PPP loan proceeds for 'other business purposes' and for 'working capital,'"" the court document said.

Fayne was released on a $10,000 bond Wednesday.",am
273,"As Vladimir Putin returns to office for a fourth term, criticism is bubbling back up over former German chancellor Gerhard Schroederâs close relationship with the Russian president.

A spokesman for current chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday (March 19) had to reject the suggestion that the EU sanction Schroeder for supporting Putin while the German was chancellor, and then taking well-paid jobs by the Russian state after leaving office. Earlier in the day, Ukraineâs foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin had backed a call for sanctions made in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall) during the weekend.

âIt is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putinâs projects abroad,â Klimkin told the German newspaper Bild. âSchroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin worldwide. So it should be examined how the EU can act here.â

The two menâs relationship is so notorious that it has spawned a word used by political analysts and human rights activists in three languages: âSchroederizationâ in English, âSchrÃ¶derisierungâ in German, and âSchroederizatsiaâ (âÐ¨ÑÑÐ´ÐµÑÐ¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñâ) in Russian. In English and Russian, âit means âthe corruption of a political elite in another country,'â said Boris Reitschuster, a German former Moscow correspondent and author of Putinâs Hidden War, at PutinCon, a gathering of the worldâs biggest Kremlin critics on March 16.

In German, the word seems to have extra nuances. While some use it to refer to corruption, one politician from Merkelâs Christian Democrats recently employed it to describe a closeness to the Kremlin. He appealed (link in German) to Schroederâs old Social Democratic Party to not develop uncomfortably close ties to Moscow or help Kremlin propaganda, which he characterized a potential âSchroederization.â

The phrase has been attributed to Edward Lucas, a hawkish former Moscow correspondent for The Economist, but Lucas says former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves coined the word.

Schroeder and Putin go way back, first becoming close as two alpha-male European leaders in the early 2000s. Just before the German was ejected from office after losing his 2005 re-election campaign to Merkel, he gave Putin a parting gift: approval of the Kremlinâs controversial Nord Stream pipeline. The project directed Russian gas into Europe via Germany, upping Moscowâs leverage over the continent. (Russia had previously relied on a route through Ukraine, which was a source of various disputes between the two countries, often leading to Moscow temporarily shutting off the pipeline.) Straight after his election defeat, Schroeder took a well-remunerated job as chairman of the project. After its completion, he became chair of its second iteration, Nord Stream 2, and last year was named chairman of Russiaâs state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Bad bromance?

The two men share more than just a passion for Russian oil and gas expansion, though. Theyâve long enjoyed having a good hug.

Like that time in April 2001.

And September 2001.

And November 2001.

And December 2001.

The AP and Reuters have no documented hugs in 2002. But the news organizations caught Schroeder and Putin finding each other again in October 2003.

And their wives awkwardly watching the two connect again in April 2004.

The two men found a furtive corner in July 2005.

By October 2005, theyâd got that walking side-hug down.

After Schroeder left office in November 2005, the press wasnât around as much to document any potential embraces. But in 2014, just after Putinâs annexation of Crimea, the European Press Association snapped him giving Schroeder a cuddle in St Petersburg on the Germanâs 70th birthday. The German media wasnât impressed.",am
274,"MIAMI (AP) â A California man was sentenced Wednesday to five years in federal prison for trying to sell forged art to a South Florida gallery.

A federal judge in Miami sentenced Philip Righter, 43, who pleaded guilty in March to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft, according to court records.

Righterâs scheme involved buying forgeries of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, investigators said. He made the forgeries appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity and elaborate backstories to establish their provenance and then offered them to galleries, auction houses and others.

In the South Florida case, Righter sent several forgeries from Los Angeles to a Miami gallery. He was asking more than $1 million for the forgeries, which were seized by the FBI. In total, Righterâs scheme attempted to scam victims out of more than $6 million and caused losses of more than $750,000.

Righter pleaded guilty Wednesday to additional counts of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraud for a Los Angeles case. He received an additional five years for that case, but the two sentences will run concurrently. The tax fraud totaled more than $100,000.

275,"North Korean hackers stole around $250 million in cryptocurrency from an exchange and then enlisted Chinese nationals to help launder more than $100 million of it, say US authorities.

The US Department of Justice has charged Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong with laundering cryptocurrency believed to have been stolen from an unnamed exchange in 2018 by the North Korean government-linked Lazarus Group.

A civil forfeiture complaint says that after stealing the money, the hackers laundered it through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions designed to prevent authorities tracing it. They used doctored photos and fake IDs to get past KYC controls.

Some of the haul was used to pay for infrastructure used in North Korean hacking campaigns against the financial industry. A UN report last year estimated that the country has generated an estimated $2 billion in revenues for its weapons programme through the state-sponsored looting of financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.

In addition to the $250 million 2018 hack, the North Koreans are said to be behind a 2019 attack on a South Korean exchange that netted $48.5 million.

Yinyin and Jiadong are accused by the DoJ of helping to launder about $100 million. Among their techniques, they converted about $1.4 million of Bitcoin into prepaid Apple iTunes gift cards. They are charged with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

The civil forfeiture complaint names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses from which the US is trying to recover funds, a portion of which has already been seized.

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski says: âThese defendants allegedly laundered over a hundred million dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency to obscure transactions for the benefit of actors based in North Korea.

âToday's actions underscore that the Department will pierce the veil of anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are located.â",am

277,"Carl Icahn, billionaire activist investor and former advisor to President Donald Trump, made headlines in recent days for having sold off shares of Manitowoc Company (MTW) ahead of an announcement by the Trump administration that new tariffs would take effect.

Shares of the crane manufacturing company dropped 4.8% on February 16, shortly after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross released the ""Steel and Aluminum 232"" reports on the same day, according to CNBC. These reports suggested a global tariff of 24% or more on all steel imports. (See also: Which Stocks Will Win or Lose From Steel, Aluminum Tariffs?)

Icahn's move has been questioned by some analysts, who claim the billionaire mogul may have acted on insider information. Icahn has responded to the allegations by saying they're ""categorically untrue.""

'Legitimate Investment Reasons'

A statement from representatives for Icahn said ""the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record:

""Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.""

Manitowoc and other construction equipment manufacturers rely heavily on steel in their manufacturing work. The fact that Icahn sold off shares just before the announcement and the drop in the company's stock price looked suspicious to some critics, who assumed that he must have known the tariff announcement was coming. No one has come forward with any evidence of these claims.

Icahn Sold One-Third of Stake

According to a filing with the SEC, investment entities which Icahn controls sold off one-third of all their stock in Manitowoc between February 12th and February 22 of this year. This decrease in position amounted to roughly 940,000 shares, sold at $32 to $34 per share, for a total of roughly $31 million.

Despite the massive sell-off, even after shedding almost a million shares, Icahn still owns 4.85% of MTW, which is down from his previous stake of 7.5%. Icahn was special advisor on regulation to the Trump administration, although he resigned from the position in August 2017.

MTW stock suffered an immediate 4.8% drop after Secretary Ross' announcement. It then fell another 6% last week after President Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum.

Allegations of insider trading are not taken lightly by regulators. Billionaire Steven A. Cohen was implicated in insider trading activities associated with a hedge fund he controlled and was subsequently banned from trading outside investor money for several years. There has been no further information about an ongoing investigation in Icahn's case, however.",am
278,"The former chief of WorldCom, convicted in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history, died just over a month after his early release from prison. Bernard Ebbers was 78.

The Canadian-born former telecommunications executive died Sunday in Brookhaven, Mississippi, surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

WorldCom Inc. collapsed and went into bankruptcy in 2002, following revelations of an $11 billion accounting fraud that included pressure by top executives on subordinates to inflate numbers to make the company seem more profitable. The collapse caused losses to stockholders, including those who had invested through retirement plans.

Ebbers was convicted in New York in 2005 on securities fraud and other charges and received a 25-year sentence. A federal appeals court judge who upheld Ebbers' conviction in 2006 wrote that WorldCom's fraudulent accounting practices were ""specifically intended to create a false picture of profitability even for professional analysts that, in Ebbers' case, was motivated by his personal financial circumstances.""

Before establishing himself in telecommunications, Ebbers had a diverse career that started in sports. He received a basketball scholarship at Mississippi College, where he majored in physical education. After graduating, he coached high school teams for a year before investing in a hotel; he eventually amassed a chain of Best Westerns in Mississippi and Texas, as well as a car dealership in Columbia, Mississippi.

Following the advice of friends and knowing little about the phone business, he invested in a small long-distance company, LDDS, in 1983. He eventually took over the day-to-day operations and bought up competitors, transforming LDDS â which was later renamed WorldCom, based in Clinton, Mississippi â into the fourth-largest long-distance company by 1996.

He was considered to be a ""no-nonsense"" man with a brash attitude who preferred jeans to a suit. One analyst cited in an early profile in the late nineties said Bernie Ebbers was ""the telephone equivalent of Bill Gates.""

By the time of its collapse over its accounting fraud scandal in 2002, WorldCom was the nation's second-largest long-distance business. Ebbers left that year and following his conviction, was imprisoned from September 2006 until Dec. 21, when he was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.

In the meantime, WorldCom reemerged as MCI, taken over by Verizon, and relocated to Ashburn, Virginia.

U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said late last year that it fell within her discretion to order the early release of Ebbers after a lawyer cited severe medical problems and said that Ebbers had experienced severe weight loss. At over 6 feet tall, he had dropped in weight from above 200 pounds to 147 pounds. Attorney Graham Carner told the judge it was possible his client might not live another 18 months.

Among other ailments, Ebbers had heart disease, Carner said. Ebbers was not in court when Caproni announced her ruling on Dec. 18; his lawyers said he was hospitalized.

""While Mr. Ebbers is physically alive ... his quality of life is gone,"" Carner said in December. ""If he was released today, Mr. Ebbers is not going to be playing tennis or running a business.""

In court papers in September, his lawyers said Ebbers unintentionally bumped into another prisoner while walking in the facility in September of 2017, only to have the prisoner go to Ebbers' open cell later in the day and physically attack him.

The papers said the attack fractured the bones around Ebbers' eyes and caused blunt head trauma and other injuries. They also said Ebbers was put into solitary confinement because his ""severely limited eyesight"" made him unable to identify the attacker.

In July 2019, one of Ebbers' daughters submitted a request that her father receive compassionate release from a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Court papers say a Bureau of Prisons official denied that request in August. The family statement said that the Bureau of Prisons ""had no diagnosis or treatment plan in place"" and Ebbers experienced a ""rapid decline"" in October, followed by multiple hospitalizations in November and December.

While prosecutors agreed that Ebbers' health had deteriorated in prison, they opposed an early release. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Cowley told the judge that such a move would send ""a terrible message to the rule of law"" because it would cut Ebbers' sentence in half.

The family statement acknowledged resistance to Ebbers' early release from victims of WorldCom's collapse, but said that many victims also expressed their support.

""Many stockholders and employees lost their investments in the fall of WorldCom. Many of our friends â and many in our family â did too,"" the statement read. ""Thankfully, Judge Caproni agreed with us â keeping Dad in prison, especially in his unexplained and undiagnosed deteriorated condition, would not bring back anyone's investments.""

The family said they would pray for the victims. The statement, which repeatedly praised Caproni, said family members plan to eventually advocate for others ""who are deserving of compassionate release to their families.""",am

280,"WASHINGTON â The U.S. Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Afghan national Pahlawan Rozi, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), for his significant role in international narcotics trafficking.

Rozi, a weapons and narcotics trafficker and hawala owner in northern Afghanistan, smuggles drugs across the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. Through his narcotics trafficking activities, Rozi has acquired large amounts of money and assets, including buildings, businesses, and orchards in Kunduz Province. He has also bribed and made payments to high-ranking Afghan Government officials to avoid police interference in his narcotics trafficking activities.

â

âRâoziâs role as a hawaladar and narcotics trafficker has incited violence and fueled crime throughout the Afghan region,â said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. âTreasury will not tolerate these illicit activities, which undermine confidence in the legitimate financial system, and we will continue to target and expose criminals like Rozi.â

This designation is the result of collaboration between Treasury, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC). The ATFC, which is based in Afghanistan, collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence reporting on Afghan insurgent financing.

As a result of todayâs action, all property and interests in property in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which Rozi has an interest is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with him.

Todayâs action is part of Treasury's ongoing efforts to apply financial sanctions against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations. Since June 2000, the OFAC has designated more than 1,400 individuals and entities pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Kingpin Act violations may result in the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million while criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Criminal penalties for other individuals may include up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Dariye was arraigned alongside Apartment le Paradis, an hotel where he was a director.

The defendant sometime in 2013 failed to report a cash transaction to the tune of N1.5billion which he received through the hotelâs account in one of the old generation banks. The amount is above the threshold of the N10million permissible by law. Additionally, the hotel was also not registered as Designated Non-Financial Institution, DNFI.

The offence is in contravention of Section 5(1) (a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 5 (b) of the same Act.

Count two of the charge reads:

âThat you, Nanle Miracle Dariye, while being a Director of Apartment le Paradis Limited and Apartment le Paradis Limited on 28 th day of March 2013 in Abuja within the Jurisdiction of this Honorable Court did commit an offence to wit: Failure to report within 7 (seven) days, a cash transaction in the sum of N551,555,428.50 (Five Hundred and Fifty One Million, Five Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Eight Naira, Fifty Kobo) paid to Apartment le Paradis Limited BY BGL Securities Ltd vide your First Bank Plc Account No 2014165731 on 28 th day of March 2013 which is above the threshold of N10,000,000 (Ten million Naira) and you hereby committed an offence contrary to Section 10(1) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 10 (3) of the same Act"".

In view of his plea, counsel to the EFCC, George Adebola, asked the court to fix a date for trial and for the defendant to be remanded in prison custody.

However, Dariyeâs counsel, Charles Abalaka, pleaded that he was yet to file application for bail as he was served with the charge late yesterday.

284,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Joe Biden says he wonât slap new taxes on people who earn less than $400,000 a year if he becomes U.S. president. But if carried through, his tax plan could create losers among those who fall far short of that symbolic income threshold. That could be a problem when it comes to asking Congress to make the Democratic contenderâs vision a reality.

The former vice presidentâs tax cannon is mostly pointed at the very rich. Biden wants to raise the top level of income tax, and remove the cap on the amount of salary on which taxes for social security have to be paid. In total, his measures could raise $2.4 trillion to $3.4 trillion over a decade, based on separate number-crunches from the Tax Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Tax Policy Center and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania â four think tanks that between them span the political aisle. All agree that his plan would raise proportionately more revenue from the wealthy than from everyday Americans.

Thereâs plenty in Bidenâs proposal to get plutocrats hot under the collar, like charging capital gains tax on inherited assets, and raising the tax on investment profits to match that of income for the highest earners â which effectively closes the so-called carried interest loophole that benefits private equity executives. Biden also plans to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28%, from 21% today. Itâs likely that would cause company profits and share prices to fall, just as they rose when President Donald Trump cut the rate from 35% in 2017.

But raising corporate taxes may affect even lower earners. One theory is that by making it less attractive to invest in companies, a higher tax rate over time reduces their output compared with what it would otherwise have been, resulting in less profit. The resulting pain falls partly on investors, but also on workers. Economists and the Treasury have, over the decades, disagreed over how that impact is parceled out. These days, the consensus is that between 20% and 25% is borne by employees.

Even though that sounds pretty abstract, it makes a difference. All of the four above-mentioned studies split Americans into equal-sized quintiles or deciles based on income. Under three of the four think tanksâ analyses, raising corporate taxes would mean all segments end up with lower average after-tax income by 2030. Penn Wharton finds only the top 10% will be penalized, but doesnât carry that analysis out past 2021. Even then, the gains for the bottom 20% of Americans in 2021 are just $155 a year.

In the real world, tax is only one of the things that will affect the economy and wages. Biden also plans to spend on things like education and infrastructure, which have a big impact on peopleâs lives and livelihoods. So under his plans, lower earners may well, in the round, be better off â and so might society overall. The tax think tanks generally donât factor in spending, but credit-ratings agency Moodyâs does, and concludes that in Bidenâs America, and with a Democratic Congress, GDP might grow 2.9% a year on average from 2020 to 2030, compared with 2.4% under Trump and a Republican legislature.

But taxing and spending are different things, and Congress would â and should â weigh them up separately. After all, if the former vice president were happy to run giant deficits, and isnât worried about inflation, he could spend as much as he likes without raising any new tax revenue at all. And even if Democrats sweep all branches of the government and executive, there will be some lawmakers who support the plans to spend but not the plans to pay for it â or vice versa.

Biden could therefore face a problem if he comes to present his tax plans to lawmakers. Considered alone, they donât deliver a big dividend for most Americans, and a lot of rich people will want to water them down. The cost to the top 0.1%, according to Penn Wharton, would be $1.3 million each in the first year after legislation was passed. In other words, thatâs how much it would be worth the richest spending to stop the Democratâs progressive ideas from getting off the ground. With that kind of opposition, Bidenâs plan may look different by the time it becomes reality.",nam
285,"John McAfee, the controversial founder of the anti-virus company that carries his name, was arrested on Saturday at Barcelonaâs El Prat airport due to allegations of, among other offenses, evading millions of dollars of taxes on supposed income from activities such as promoting cryptocurrencies.

The United States Department of Justice announced on Monday all of the charges that McAfee is facing, and explained that they are awaiting for the extradition process from Spain to be completed, according to British daily the Financial Times, and which was later confirmed to EL PAÃS by sources from the Spanish High Court, the Audiencia Nacional. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also leveled accusations against McAfee in a civil court.

The eccentric millionaire was apprehended at the Spanish airport at 9.30am when he was due to take a flight to Istanbul, according to police sources. When his passport details were checked, officers discovered that there was an international warrant out for his arrest on accusations of fraud. He was arrested on the spot.

On Sunday, McAfee was brought before a court and was questioned by a judge via videoconference. When the testimony concluded, the magistrate ordered him to be held in custody while his extradition order was processed. The entrepreneur is currently being held in Brians prison, in Sant Esteve Sesrovire, Barcelona.

The American businessman is accused of hiding millions of dollars of income from US tax authorities for the promotion of cryptocurrencies and the sale of the rights to his life story, the Financial Times reported. Public prosecutors believe that the businessman used accounts in other peopleâs names to hide this income, which was obtained between 2014 and 2018. The US authorities also accuse him of acquiring assets, including a yacht, using other peopleâs names.

Since McAfee sold his antivirus company to Intel for â¬6.5 billion at the start of the previous decade, he has had a number of run-ins with the law. In 2012, he fled from the authorities after the death of his neighbor in Belize. He took refuge in neighboring Guatemala and was later deported to the US, although he was never charged in relation to the case.

In 2019, McAfee himself announced that he had fled the United States because he was facing accusations from the public prosecutor. Last year, speaking to a news agency from Cuba, he stated that he had not paid taxes for the last eight years. âI have not paid taxes for eight years. I will not pay taxes again â it is unconstitutional and illegal,â he said. He was also arrested in July 2019 in Dominican Republic for carrying weapons on his yacht.

A tweet from John McAfee from earlier this year in which he explains his refusal to pay taxes.

According to the Department of Justice, he did not pay taxes for five years, between 2014 and 2018. The investigation was opened in June, but had remained sealed until his arrest. The SEC has brought civil charges against McAfee, saying he has promoted the purchase of cryptocurrencies among his followers on Twitter without warning that he was being paid for that promotion. According to the market watchdog, he was paid more than â¬19.5 million for the tweets. His bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, is also being investigated. If convicted of all charges, McAfee could face up to 30 years in prison, British daily The Independent reported.

Last March, when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, McAfee found himself in Tarragona, Spain, from where he began chronicling his experiences under the strict lockdown implemented in the country, complaining that the restrictions on mobility prevented him from doing what he wanted.

286,"PARIS â The president of Serbia, Boris Tadic, lashed out at organized crime and its corrosive effect on the Balkans in a speech Wednesday, pressing for an international investigation of human organ trafficking in Kosovo and broad protection for witnesses.

He made his comments in Strasbourg before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which on Tuesday adopted an investigative report that has roiled the leadership in Kosovo. It alleged that Serb prisoners were killed at the end of the Kosovo conflict in 1999 to harvest organs for transplant for an organized crime group, Drenica, with ties to the current Kosovo prime minister, Hashim Thaci.

The Serbian president did not refer to Mr. Thaci by name in his comments, but he made a direct connection between the spreading influence of organized crime and the report on trade in human organs.

âThe real purpose of organized crime is not just to live in parallel with legal society. Rather, it seeks to become society,â Mr. Tadic said, adding, âIt subverts politics. It corrupts economiesâ and âit kills to steal parts of peopleâs bodies.â

The assembly â a pan-European organization that investigates human rights issues and makes recommendations â was also weighing three resolutions on Wednesday to strengthen witness protection in the Balkans, particularly in Kosovo, where the authorities lack funding and a specialized police force to prevent intimidation of witnesses.

Kosovo, a tiny nation of two million people and close-knit clans, is particularly problematic because âwitnesses are often perceived as betraying their community when they give evidence,â according to a report prepared for the assembly by one of its members, Jean Charles Gardetto, of Monaco. He noted that in a nation where everyone seems to know one another, âmany people do not believe that they have a moral or legal duty to testify as a witness in criminal cases.â

Dick Marty, a former Swiss magistrate who investigated organ trafficking for the assembly, faced that issue when he tried to gather more information about the Drenica organized crime group. According to his report, based on intelligence reports, it had roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army in the Kosovo conflict in 1999 and evolved into a criminal enterprise that controlled the heroin and narcotics trade and six detention centers in Albania to develop a black market for human kidney transplants.

His report was commissioned in response to allegations about organ trafficking in a 2008 memoir by Carla del Ponte, the former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a U.N. body that pursued war crimes suspects, but ultimately did not pursue the allegations of organ trafficking.

Mr. Thaci, the Kosovo prime minister, has strenuously denied the allegations, and he and other officials there have supported an investigation. So has Prime Minister Sali Berisha of Albania, who has dismissed Mr. Martyâs investigation as a âcompletely racist and defamatory report.â

âWe are ready to face and we as Kosovo want to faceâ the report, Jakup Krasniqi, Kosovoâs acting president, told reporters. âWe are convinced that this cannot be proven in any way.â

European Union officials in Brussels have requested more evidence of wrongdoing from Mr. Marty, who has been reluctant to release specific information because of a lack of safeguards for witnesses.

With the call for an independent international investigation of the organ trafficking allegations and witness protection procedures, the assembly is pressing for the sort of commission that can be costly and take years to give results.

An example is the U.N. Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which was created to investigate the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005 and officially opened in March 2009. It is just now issuing its first indictments and could be operating through 2014.",nam
287,"TULSA, Okla. â A Norman man pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court for his role as a money launderer in a Nigerian romance scam that defrauded multiple victims, including elder Americans, of millions, announced U.S. Attorney Trent Shores.

Afeez Olajide Adebara, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering before U.S. District Court Judge Gregory K. Frizzell. Adebaraâs sentencing hearing is set for Feb. 3, 2021.

âAdebara organized and led a money laundering operation from Oklahoma in order to conceal the proceeds of a Nigerian Romance Scam. He and his co-conspirators defrauded an Oklahoman and two other victims of more than $1.5 million,â said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. âRomance scams inflict the highest reported financial losses yearly, totaling about $200 million in 2019, when compared to other online scams. Con artists like Adebara have no shame. They care not if their victims are elders, veterans, or hard working Americans living paycheck to paycheck. I commend the FBI agents and federal prosecutors who took down this international money laundering operation.â

In his plea agreement, Adebara admitted that he knew the money involved in the financial transactions involved the proceeds from unlawful activity. He further stated that he knew the financial transactions were designed, in whole or in part, to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of the unlawful activity.

From 2017 through and November 2019, Adebara knowingly concealed the proceeds of a romance scam operation by moving money between and among multiple bank accounts that were opened under various aliases using fake passports and other fraudulent identification documents to obscure the source of the funds and the identities of the co-conspirators. Court documents state that he and his co-conspirators took further steps to conceal the source of the funds, took a commission, and directed the remainder of the funds back to the online romance scammers in Nigeria, including in the form of vehicles and vehicle parts.

According to court documents, Adebara coordinated with overseas co-conspirators who had assumed false identities on online dating websites and social media platforms with the intent to defraud victims. Adebara opened multiple accounts using fraudulent identities then provided the account and routing numbers to the overseas co-conspirators. The overseas co-conspirators told victims they were U.S. residents working abroad. In fact, the investigation revealed that these overseas co-conspirators were located in Nigeria. As these online ârelationshipsâ continued, the overseas co-conspiratorsâ would request increasingly larger sums of money, claiming that the funds were needed to complete business projects or to return to the United States. The victims were directed by the overseas co-conspirators to send funds to Adebara and othersâ bank accounts, assuring the victims that he would allocate the money as needed.

Adebara was charged on Nov. 13, 2019, along with nine co-defendants. John Oluwaseun Ogundele, 31, formerly of Norman, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2020.

The remaining defendants are Joshua Naandom Ditep, 25, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Paul Usoro, 26, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Chibuzo Godwin Obiefuna, Jr., 27, U.S. citizen residing in Long Beach, California; Tobiloba Kehinde, 28, Nigerian citizen residing in Norman; Jamiu Ibukun Adedeji, 24, Nigerian citizen, residing in Norman; First and last name unknown #1, who maintained an address in Brooklyn, New York; First and last name unknown #2, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas; and First and last name unknown #3, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas. Ditep, Usoro, Obiefuna, Kehinde, and Adedeji await trial while the three additional co-defendants remain fugitives. These remaining defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The FBIâs Oklahoma City Field Office conducted the investigation. Trial Attorney Babasijibomi Moore of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Nassar of the Northern District of Oklahoma are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of an ongoing national effort by the Department of Justice to address online fraud schemes often based out of Nigeria that target U.S. citizens. The public is encouraged to report potential online fraud activity or scams to the FBI.",am
288,"Enron Corp. founder Kenneth Lay, who faced decades in prison for one of the most sprawling business frauds in U.S. history, died Wednesday while vacationing in Aspen, Colo. He was 64.

Lay died of coronary artery disease, according to Mesa County Coroner Robert Kurtzman, who added that there was evidence Lay had a previous heart attack.

The Pitkin, Colo., Sheriff's Department said they were called to Lay's house in Old Snowmass, Colo., shortly after 1 a.m. He was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:11 a.m. Lay, who lived in Houston, frequently vacationed in Colorado.

Lay ascended from near-poverty as a minister's son in Missouri to the pinnacle of corporate America. He was considered a visionary who had President Bush's ear during Enron's halcyon days, but his reputation and monumental wealth shattered with that of his company.

""I guess when you're facing the rest of your life in jail and in your heart you know you're an innocent man, I guess it's too much to bear,"" said close friend Willie Alexander.

Lay turned a sleepy natural gas pipeline group into a model of new age capitalism, says CBS News' Harry Smith. Enron became a darling of Wall Street and at its peak turned a $100 billion profit.

Lay and former Enron executive Jeffery Skilling were convicted of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud on May 25. The verdict put the blame for the 2001 demise of the high-profile energy trader, once the nation's seventh-largest company, squarely on its top two executives.

Lay was also convicted of bank fraud and making false statements to banks in a separate, non-jury trial related to Lay's personal finances. All along, Lay insisted there was no fraud at Enron, Smith reports. But a jury wasn't convinced.

Family spokeswoman Kelly L. Kimberly issued a statement saying, ""Ken Lay passed away early this morning in Aspen. The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate. And out of respect for the family, we will release further details at a later time.""

Pastor Steve Wende of First United Methodist Church of Houston, said in a statement that church member Lay died unexpectedly of a ""massive coronary.""

Wende said Lay and his wife, Linda, were in Colorado for the week ""and his death was totally unexpected. Apparently, his heart simply gave out.""

Lay was scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 23. He faced decades in prison.

Skilling, reached by telephone at his home in Houston, told The Associated Press that he was aware of Lay's death, but declined further comment.

Prosecutors in Lay's trial declined comment Wednesday, both on his unexpected death and what may become of the government's effort to seek a $43.5 million judgment from Lay that they say he pocketed as part of the conspiracy.

Lay showed no signs of either physical or mental weakness before or during his trial, reports CBS News correspondent Barry Bagnato. He was combative on the witness stand and was hurt by his main lawyer's sudden illness.

Lay led Enron's meteoric rise from a staid natural gas pipeline company formed by a 1985 merger to an energy and trading conglomerate that reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 in 2001 and claimed $101 billion in annual revenues. He traveled in the highest business and political circles.

For many years, his corporation was the single biggest contributor to President Bush, who nicknamed him ""Kenny Boy.""",am
289,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A judicial probe of possible corruption during Argentinaâs last government is also threatening the new administration as some of President Mauricio Macriâs own allies face investigation.

Macri, a center-rightist, took over as president in December from outgoing leftist Cristina Fernandez, pledging to root out corruption as well as implement sweeping market-friendly economic reforms.

Investigations have already led to the arrest of a Fernandez ally and landed the ex-president in court for questioning. But now questions are also being asked of some close to Macri, threatening to taint his image.

Iecsa, a construction firm that is part of the Macri family empire and controlled by his cousin Angel Calcaterra, is one of nearly 100 companies in Argentina being investigated as part of Brazilâs growing âCar Washâ scandal, an Argentine judicial source close to the case told Reuters.

The source did not provide specifics of the Iecsa case, but the âCar Washâ probe has focused on kickbacks and other irregularities in bloated contracts at state oil firm Petrobras.

A source close to Iecsa said the company âhas never been notified of any investigationâ.

Government anti-money laundering and anti-corruption officials, newly appointed by Macri, are pushing to investigate corruption under Fernandezâs administration.

They have encouraged whistleblowers to come forward and offered lighter punishments for wrongdoers in exchange for information.

Macri has kept his distance from the probes.

âI will permit, stand back and work with it when needed, but justice has to work independently,â said Macri this week.

Still, Fernandez is portraying herself as the victim of persecution.

âThey can call me to testify 20 times. They can imprison me. But they will not be able to silence me,â she told cheering supporters after testifying about charges against the central bank for selling U.S. dollar futures at below-market rates during her presidency.

Daniel Scioli, the opposition leader and Fernandez ally who lost to Macri in the presidential election, has warned against a witch-hunt.

âWe hope politics does not become judicialised and that the justice system does not become politicized,â he told Reuters.

âK MONEY ROADâ

Argentine media are closely following the twists and turns of the corruption allegations that have become known as the âK money roadâ, an allusion to Fernandezâs deceased husband and ex-president Nestor Kirchner and their âKirchneristaâ movement.

Prosecutors are probing a complex web of cases linked to property entrepreneur Lazaro Baez, a close ally of both Fernandez and Kirchner.

He was arrested last month for questioning after some $5 million was allegedly deposited in a bank account in his sonâs name.

Fernandez denies any wrongdoing.

Associates of Macri, including Iecsa, also have Baez connections. Iecsa joined forces in recent years with Baezâs Austral Construcciones in a failed attempt to compete for public works projects.

Iecsa is not part of the judicial probe into Baez and the source close to the company said it was not a partner of Austral, but âjust worked with it on two bids, as it has with many other companiesâ.

The source added that Macriâs cousin Calcaterra is trying to sell Iecsa to avoid possible conflicts of interest.

Also caught in the probe of Baez is a federal intelligence official, Silvia Majdalani, who was appointed by Macri and is now being investigated for money laundering. Other officials in Macriâs government are also being questioned in the dollar futures case.

A spokesman for the government said: âThe government isnât worried because it is allowing justice to act freely.â

The Supreme Court has asked judges to push ahead with corruption and drug trafficking cases and legal sources say judges who may have faced stonewalling from security forces or the civil service under Fernandezâs government can now count on more collaboration.

âThere are judges that now feel empowered to investigate the last administration. Before, they couldnât get access to information,â a federal court source told Reuters.

Yet, there are political risks. When Fernandez went to court to answer questions in the central bank case, huge crowds filled the streets of Buenos Aires in a show of support as she railed against Macri.

âThey went looking for the K money road,â she cried. âThey found the M money road.â",am
290,"MEXICO CITY â

Former Mexican Defense Secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who led the countryâs armed forces for six years under then-President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, has been arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges at Los Angeles International Airport, U.S. and Mexican sources confirmed Thursday.

Two people with knowledge of the arrest said Cienfuegos was taken into custody on a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration warrant. One of the people said the warrant was for drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

The DEA declined to comment Thursday night.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard did not say on what charges Cienfuegos was detained. He wrote on his Twitter account that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau had informed him of the generalâs arrest and that Cienfuegos had a right to receive consular assistance.

A senior Mexican official who cannot be quoted because he wasnât authorized to give details of the case said officials are waiting to be told the specific charges.

The official said Cienfuegos was arrested when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport with his family. His family members were released, and he was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center.

Cienfuegos served from 2012 to 2018 as secretary of defense. He is the highest-ranking former Cabinet official arrested since the top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna was taken into custody in Texas in 2019. Garcia Luna, who served under then-President Felipe CalderÃ³n, has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.

Cienfuegos is 72 and has retired from active duty. Mexicoâs Defense Secretariat had no immediate reaction to the arrest.

Mike Vigil, the DEAâs former chief of international operations, said that when he was in Mexico in 2012 he heard corruption allegations about Cienfuegos.

âThere were always allegations of corruption, nothing we could sink our teeth into. That was kind of unheard of because Mexico has always put the military on a pedestal,â said Vigil, author of the book âThe Land of Enchantment Cartel.â

âThe corruption is just coming to roost, because individuals who were once untouchable are now getting arrested,â Vigil said. âIf they cooperate [with U.S. prosecutors], there are others who are going to be falling.â He said U.S. officials âusually donât want to trade down, they usually trade up,â seeking evidence against equal or higher-ranking officials.

âItâs really a precarious situation for Mexico to have two Cabinet-level officials arrested in the U.S.,â he said.

Whatever the charges, it will be a tough blow for Mexico, where the army and navy are some of the few remaining respected public institutions.

Though President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has vowed to go after corruption and lawbreaking under past administrations, he has also relied more heavily on the army â and charged it with more tasks, ranging from building infrastructure projects to distributing medical supplies â than any Mexican leader in recent history.

Under Cienfuegos, the Mexican army was accused of frequent human rights abuses, but that was true of both his predecessors and his successor in the post.

The worst scandal in Cienfuegosâ tenure involved the 2014 army killings of suspects in a grain warehouse.

The June 2014 massacre involved soldiers who killed 22 suspects at the warehouse in the town of Tlatlaya. Though some died in an initial shootout with the army patrol â in which one soldier was wounded â a human rights investigation later found that at least eight and perhaps as many as a dozen suspects were executed after they surrendered.",am
291,"OTTAWA â A two-year inquiry into Brian Mulroneyâs dealings with German-Canadian arms lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber has concluded that the former prime minister acted in an âinappropriateâ way when he accepted large amounts of cash from Schreiber.

The report by Justice Jeffrey Oliphant said Mulroney âfailed to live up to the standard of conduct that he himself adopted in the 1985 ethics code.â

The judge said he could not accept Mulroneyâs testimony that his acceptance of at least $225,000 in cash was an error in judgment. Rather, it was an attempt to hide the transactions, Oliphant said.

âThe reason Mr. Schreiber made the payments in cash and Mr. Mulroney accepted them in cash was that both wanted to conceal the fact that the transactions had occurred between them,â the judge said in a summary read to the media.

âSomething was amiss,â Oliphant said. âThese dealings do not reflect the highest standards of conduct, nor do they represent conduct that is so scrupulous it will bear the closest public scrutiny.â

If the dealings were appropriate, there would have been a contract, an exchange of letters or some documentation confirming the agreement, the judge said.

âWhy, then, was there a need for such secrecy? The answer is that Mr. Mulroney wanted to conceal the fact that he had received money from Mr. Schreiber.â

However, Oliphant rejected Schreiber's testimony that the lobbying agreement between the two men was made while Mulroney was still prime minister in 1993.

He said he was unable to determine whether Mulroney's statement that he received $225,000 from Schreiber was true or whether, as Schreiber testified, the amount was $300,000.

During the hearings, Mulroney said he took the money to lobby international leaders for the sale of light-armoured vehicles on behalf of Schreiber. But Oliphant expressed skepticism about Mulroney's explanation, saying âfor different reasons, none of the people to whom Mr. Mulroney says he spoke were availableâ to Oliphant commission of inquiry.

âI am not able to find that any services were ever provided by Mr. Mulroney for the monies paid to him by Mr. Schreiber.â

Oliphant noted that Mulroney accepted âcash-stuffed envelopes from Mr. Schreiber on three separate occasions,â did not make a record of the payments, did not deposit the money in a bank or disclose the payments when given an opportunity to do so later. The judge said that this âgoes a long wayâ to âsupporting my position that the financial dealings between Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Mulroney were inappropriate.â

Oliphant also criticized Mulroney's statements in 1996 during proceedings in his $50-million lawsuit against the federal government, in which he claimed damages arising from Ottawa's inquiry about Mulroney's financial holdings to the Swiss government. Speaking under oath in that case, Mulroney did not explain his dealings with Schreiber because, the former prime minister later explained, he was not asked specifically about those dealings. Instead, Mulroney said that he had seen Schreiber a couple of times for a âcup of coffee.â

Saying that the former prime minister did not âdisclose the true state of affairs,â Oliphant said, âI find that Mr. Mulroney acted inappropriately in failing to disclose his dealings with Mr. Schreiber and the payments he received when he gave evidencesâ in the Airbus lawsuit.

Mulroney received a $2.1-million settlement from the federal government in that lawsuit, but former Liberal cabinet ministers have said they would not have made the settlement had they known at the time of Mulroney's financial link to Schreiber.

In Question Period Monday, Liberal MP Siobhan Coady (St. John's South - Mount Pearl) asked whether Ottawa would press for the return of the $2.1 million, given Oliphant's findings. Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said only that the government would review the inquiry's recommendations.

The inquiry arose from a 2007 allegation by Schreiber that he paid a large sum of money to Mulroney as part of a lobbying deal the two men reached shortly before the Progressive Conservative politician left 24 Sussex in 1993.

Schreiber said it was $300,000 but Mulroney later said he took $225,000 in cash. Mulroney also disputed the timing, saying the two men met shortly before he stepped down as prime minister but no agreement was reached until later.

Schreiberâs allegations sparked national attention, prompting Mulroney to call for hearings to clear the air. Harper agreed and announced on November 14, 2007, that University of Waterloo President David Johnston would develop a mandate for a public inquiry.

Based on Johnstonâs recommendations, Harper established the Oliphant commission, which held public hearings in 2009. Oliphantâs report was due Dec. 31, but, citing the 150,000 pages of documents received at the inquiry, Oliphant asked for an extension until today.

Oliphant was asked to delve into the circumstances surrounding Schreiberâs payments to Mulroney, including when they were made, what was the source of the cash, what servicesâif anyâwere rendered in return for the money and what happened to the cash after Mulroney received it. The judge was also ordered to examine whether ethical rules or guidelines for MPs or former cabinet ministers were broken by Mulroney.

Estimates of the cost of the inquiry have reached $16 millionâincluding $1.8 million for Mulroneyâs lawyers.

Mulroney and Schreiber both testified at the Oliphant inquiry last year; Schreiber was extradited to Germany shortly after the hearings wrapped up. German authorities had been seeking his extradition for 10 years on charges of fraud and bribery in relation to a 1999 corporate bribery scandal that shook the countryâs political foundations.

Earlier this month, Schreiber was sentenced by a German court to eight years in prison for tax evasion.

Before Oliphant was appointed, Mulroney gave testimony on his dealings with Schreiber at a House of Commons committee. After the parliamentary hearings, Mulroney changed his mind about having a commission of inquiry, saying it was no longer necessary. But Harper went ahead anyway with the Oliphant commission.

A source close to the former prime minister said last week that he just wants to put the entire Schreiber affair behind him as soon as possible.

âThe absolute need from Mr. Mulroneyâs and his familyâs point of view at this stage is that this closes the door, that it is the end of the story and life continues in a different frame the day after,â the source said.",am
292,"Companies controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich donated tens of millions of pounds to a highly controversial Israeli settler group accused of displacing Palestinian families from Jerusalem, according to leaked documents seen by BBC News Arabic.

The billionaire Russian oligarch, who was granted Israeli citizenship in 2018, has been an avid philanthropist in Israel, donating huge sums to research and development projects and invest ing in local firms.

However, four companies he either owns or controls in the British Virgin Islands have contributed more than $100m (Â£74m) to Elad, a group that supports settlements in the Palestinian neighbourhood of occupied East Jerusalem called Silwan, BBC News Arabic reported.

Those figures would mean the British football club owner was the biggest single donor over the past 15 years to Elad, a Hebrew word which means âGodâs eternal faithâ, it added.

The group, which also receives backing from the Israeli government, has sought to strengthen the Jewish presence in the neighbourhood of Silwan at the expense of its Arab residents.

Elad runs an archaeological site in Silwan called the City of David that has become a huge tourist attraction. The dig has been criticised by European Union diplomats as seeking to ignore the ancient cityâs diverse history in favour of âan exclusively Jewish narrative, while detaching the place from its Palestinian surroundingsâ.

The City of David website said it is âcommitted to continuing King Davidâs legacy as well as revealing and connecting people to ancient Jerusalemâs glorious past through four key initiatives: archaeological excavation, tourism development, educational programming and residential revitalizationâ.

Elad, similar to other settler organisations, has expanded by buying Palestinian houses and using controversial Israeli laws that allow the state to take over Palestinian property. Approximately 450 settlers now live alongside almost 10,000 Palestinians in Silwan.

BBC News Arabic discovered the Abramovich donations while trawling through thousands of leaked documents detailing $2t n (Â£1.55tn) of potentially corrupt transactions that were washed through the US financial system.

More than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed with the US governmentâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) were leaked to Buzzfeed News, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, of which the BBC is a member.

Banks and other financial institutions file SARs when they believe a client is using their services for potential criminal activity. While a SAR in itself does not oblige a bank to cease doing business with the client in question, they point to contentious actions hidden in the financial world.

The leaks, dubbed the FinCEN Files, have already rocked the financial sector, with allegations of dirty money flowing freely around the world. Shares in the banking sector fell on Monday. Other high-profile figures, such as Trumpâs former political strategist, Paul Manafort, has also been identified in a SAR.

The BBC report did not say whether the Abramovich companies or the donations were included in an SAR, or accuse Abramovich or the firms of breaking the law in any country. Abramovich had been the subject of a 2016 SAR regarding offshore shell companies related to his football business.

In its report, aired on its flagship Panorama programme, BBC Arabic cited Elad as saying they abide by all Israeli non-profit organisation regulations but that they would not confirm if Abramovich was a donor.

The news channel quoted a spokesman for Abramovich as saying: â[he] is a committed and generous supporter of Israeli and Jewish civil society, and over the past 20 years he has donated over five hundred million dollars to support healthcare, science, education and Jewish communities in Israel and around the world.â

Settlement activity on occupied land is considered illegal under international law. Israel argues all of Jerusalem as its sovereign territory, although that claim is largely unrecognised.

Donald Trumpâs recognition of Jerusalem as Israelâs capital has emboldened the Israeli government and powerful settler movement. The US ambassador to Israel and vocal supporter of settlements, David Friedman, took part in an opening ceremony at the City of David.",am
293,"Daja (Uncle), is accused of being the leader of a well-structured criminal group which falsified documents, appropriated lands, bribed officials, and laundered money, according to an indictment submitted by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, prosecutor and obtained by Prishtina Insight.

The 264-page indictment, drafted by Italian Prosecutor Danilo Ceccarelli, which will be published by Prishtina Insight and BIRN Kosovoâs Albanian-language portal Kallxo in several installments, reveals how Sylaâs pension from Switzerland was allegedly used to finance the criminal group and sponsor group meetings in a Prishtina restaurant. The indictment also reveals the involvement of Kosovo Serbs in the group led by the former commander of Kosovo Liberation Armyâs, KLA, Headquarters.From a corner of a restaurant in Prishtinaâs Sunny Hill neighborhood, Azem Sylaâs âHQâ gave out orders, instructions, and guidelines for the other members of the group between 2006-2016, according to the indictment. The prosecution alleges that Azem Syla would sit at a table in the restaurant while his interlocutors would come and go, receiving various orders.The indictment, filed on October 24, accuses tens of individuals of misuse and appropriation of land in Prishtinaâs suburbs.Azem Syla, who was a member of the Kosovo Assembly during the 2010-2014 legislature, is on the top of the list of the accused. In the indictment obtained by Prishtina Insight, another 21 are accused of being members a group described by the indictment as one of the most active, well organized and long-lasting in Kosovoâs history.

In April 2016, criminal investigations resulted in a massive police raid by EULEX and Kosovo Police. On the morning of April 27, police raided Sylaâs personal compound but failed to apprehend him. A couple of days later, Syla surrendered to police. The prosecution filed two indictments, accusing two groups consisting of 22 and 17 people respectively, on various charges including organized crime, falsifying documents, bribery, fraud and money laundering.

The first count of organized crime accuses Syla and 12 others of having knowingly and intentionally committed serious crimes as part of a structured organized group, with the aim of obtaining financial and material benefits.In the indictment, Syla is described as the âorganizer, supervisor, manager and directorâ of the criminal group. The indictment also accuses him of: âcoordinatingâ and âsupervisingâ the entire operation; assigning other members their roles within a well-structured hierarchy; and approving or refusing operational proposals by the other members. Syla is accused of giving orders and instructions to the other members and asking for reports about the continuous criminal activities. He is also accused of participating in the âunderlying criminal offensesâ described by the indictment by giving instructions, guidance and approval, and receiving most of the profits from criminal activities.

Shaban Syla, who, like Azem Syla, was born in Kishnareke, played an almost identical role to the former MP. Syla, who in 2012 was found guilty for attempted murder of a member of the Kosovo Democratic League, LDK, as part of âthe Bllaca 2â case, is also described as an organizer, supervisor, manager and director of the criminal group. According to the indictment, Shaban and Azem Syla were constantly in touch with regards to strategic decision-making and planning.

âSpecifically, he [Shaban Syla] organized and managed all the actions aimed at identifying Serbian individuals who had verdicts and documents useful for the criminal activities, liaised with them and involved them in the organized criminal group; organized and coordinated the falsification of verdicts and of the related documents; identified the socially owned land parcels to acquire illegally; liaised with, and corrupted, officials in the Municipal Court, at the Cadastral Office and in other public offices in order to obtain the original documents to falsify, to receive favorable decision and to speed up the procedure,â the 2016 indictment says.

A similar role was played by Shpresim Uka, another defendant from the âBllaca 2â case, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder.

Ljubisa Vujovic, the only Serb indicted, was a member and supporter of the criminal group and actively participated in criminal activities.

âSpecifically, Ljubisa Vujovic provided the group with the original verdict no. 1164/90 dated 24 June 1992, which returned to his family the land parcel no.145 in Fushe Kosova, knowing that the group was going to falsify it replacing that parcel with others,â reads the indictment. Vujovic also supported the group by providing it with âfalse documents, photos, and personal data of his family members that were used to create false ID documents, authorization, power of attorney and Court certifications.â

Other Serbs involved in the criminal activities have not been indicted because they are unreachable to the prosecution, which suspects they are being sheltered in Serbia. Since Kosovoâs institutions are not recognized by Serbia, suspects have evaded justice in the past by fleeing to Serbia or northern Kosovo.

Thirty-nine people, including their alleged leader Azem Syla, were indicted on charges of organized crime, money laundering, bribery, aggravated fraud, fraud on duty, issuing illegal court decisions, abuse of duty, legalizing falsified content, and fiscal evasion.",am
294,"Washington â Federal prosecutors have charged Houston-based technology executive Robert Brockman with hiding $2bn in income from the IRS over 20 years, in the biggest tax fraud case against an individual in US history.

At the same time, the US attorney for the northern district of California announced he had struck a non-prosecution agreement with Robert Smith, the billionaire chief executive of Vista Equity Partners, in exchange for his help in securing the charges against Brockman. Smith was to pay a nearly $140m fine for concealing income offshore as part of the agreement, reports said.

At a press conference, US attorney David Anderson said Brockman used various offshore entities in Caribbean, Bermuda and Switzerland to evade taxes.

He said Brockman also bought and sold debt securities in his own company, ""breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt"".

Anderson said Smith, who famously announced at 2019's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the scheme.

""Although Smith wilfully and knowingly violated the law, Smith has accepted responsibility and agreed to provide complete and fruitful co-operation,"" Anderson said.",am
295,"A Toronto printer and acclaimed classical pianist accused of a multimillion-dollar fraud stretching back six years was arrested Tuesday, with a court appearance set for next month.

Tzvi Erez, 44, faces 10 charges of fraud, one for each alleged victim, encompassing losses of around $9-million.

The alleged fraud surfaced when Mr. Erez filed for bankruptcy two years ago, police say, and involved him telling the complainants he had secured large printing contracts with such big-league companies as Tommy Hilfiger, Colgate-Palmolive, Loblaw and Subway.

""Basically he asked people to invest in his printing business and promised them returns, but it turns out these contracts were fraudulent,"" said Detective Rudy Martin of the Toronto Police Service's Financial Crimes Unit.

The contracts ostensibly entailed producing catalogues, brochures and other promotional material.

Mr. Erez emigrated from Israel to Canada in 1982 and all his alleged victims belong to Toronto's Jewish community.

""They were business people and elderly people, all kinds, with money I guess, from all over the city,"" Det. Martin said.

Mr. Erez's name is well known in the city's Jewish circles because he is an accomplished pianist, beginning his career in Israel as a childhood prodigy.

Married with two children, he holds a business degree and has released two well-regarded CDs, one of which described him as ""a charismatic genius"" blessed with ""towering musical talent.""

The alleged frauds began in 2005 and continued until 2009, and this is not Mr. Erez's first brush with the law.

In 2009, he was accused of bilking dozens of investors out of $27-million in an alleged Ponzi scheme that went back to 2003.

Those charges, too, arose from the bankruptcy of his printing company, E. Graphix Ltd., and also involved supposedly major printing contracts yielding generous returns.

A receiver's report, however, concluded the operation was far smaller than claimed, its true size concealed with forged invoices and purchase orders, kept afloat with a Ponzi scheme whereby the first investors were repaid with funds put up by new ones.

In a move that generated wide controversy, prosecutors announced in September, 2010 that all the charges had been dropped because of insufficient resources to proceed with the complex case.

A lawsuit was also launched against Mr. Erez by one of the investors, but that too was abandoned as it became clear he had no money.",am

Estate agent group Countrywide has been hit with a Â£215,000 fine by HMRC for money-laundering failures.

The company was fined for failing to ensure that its money-laundering procedures and record-keeping were in line with regulations.

HMRC also made surprise visits to 50 estate agents in a week to crack down on money-laundering in the industry.

Countrywide told the BBC it has improved its anti-money laundering controls.

Economic Secretary John Glen said: ""I have zero tolerance for firms prepared to turn a blind eye to the law.""

Countrywide told the BBC it had ""conducted a full review of its anti-money laundering controls and has taken thorough measures to strengthen the processes that support and monitor compliance throughout the business.""

The changes include hiring and training more staff to monitor deals, it said in a statement.

The company is due to announce its 2018 results on Thursday.

The details of the fine are included in an HMRC list of businesses that have not complied with 2017 money-laundering regulations.

Other firms fined include the now-defunct online agency Tepilo, which was charged a Â£68,595 penalty.

Tax officers visited 50 estate agents across England after they were suspected of trading without being registered under the money-laundering regulations.

HMRC said it would now take action against businesses that failed to comply, although it has not named any of them.

However, 35 were in London, five in Leicester, four in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire combined, three in Greater Manchester and one in each in Watford, Wakefield and Wolverhampton.

Ben Wallace, Minister for National Security and Economic Crime, said: ""Criminals who seek to use this country as a place to launder money should be in no doubt that they have nowhere to hide.

""Estate agents are a crucial line of defence against them and that's why they're under a legal - and moral - obligation to file a report when they spot something amiss.""",am
297,"Israel Police recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for bribery and breach of trust in two cases Tuesday night, Israel's Channel 2 and Channel 10 reported. After a 14-month-long investigation, police announced on Tuesday that it found enough evidence to recommend the stateâs prosecution to indict Netanyahu for bribery and breach of trust in Case 1000, the âgifts affair"" and Case 2000, the "" Yediot Aharanot Affair.""In Case 1000, the âgifts affair,â it is alleged that Netanyahu improperly accepted expensive gifts from different businessmen.In Case 2000, the â Yediot Aharonot affair,â Netanyahu allegedly negotiated with publisher Arnon âNoniâ Mozes for favorable coverage of himself in Yediot Aharonot in exchange for support of a bill to weaken Israel Hayom, the largest circulation Hebrew-language paper and Yediot âs biggest competitor. Police also reccomended indicting Mozes and Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan, who is among those alleged to have given Netanyahu expensive gifts as bribes. The prime minister, in the past, rejected both allegations claiming that ""it is not illegal to accept gifts from friends"" and that ""Nothing will happen because nothing happened.""At this stage, the prosecution and Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit will examine the evidence that police collected throughout the investigations, and will later decide whether to actually indict the prime minister or not.Netanyahu is not required at this point to resign from office. The law says that only after a peremptory Supreme Court verdict (meaning after an appeal was submitted and rejected), the prime minister must resign from office.These police recommendations come in the shadow of an ongoing campaign by Netanyahu to discharge the credibility of his investigators. The premierâs attacks were made in response to remarks made by Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Roni Alsheich, who hinted that Netanyahu had sent private investigators to collect information against police officers who are involved in his case.On Thursday, Netanyahu said on Facebook: âItâs shocking to see that he [Alsheich] is repeating the outlandish and false claim that [I] supposedly used private investigators against police officers.ââEvery decent person will ask himself: How can people who say such outlandish things regarding the prime minister then question him objectively and be impartial when it is time to reach a decision about him?â Netanyahu asked.",am
298,"An international firm has agreed to be fined almost Â£20,000 after accepting it failed to carry out due diligence on a string of foreign investor clients. Taylor Vinters LLP made a regulatory settlement agreement with the SRA after admitting four rule breaches under money laundering regulations.

According to the settlement, the firm acted from 2014 in 161 matters for 88 overseas nationals buying expensive off-plan property plots in London. By 2018, it had received around Â£16.8m into the client bank account but an employee or manager of the firm had met only half of the clients. In 17 matters, involving nine clients, money was received without any customer due diligence being undertaken: in 26 further matters the firm held some due diligence documents such as passports but had not still completed all the checks required.

Taylor Vinters stated that its client bank account details had been provided to clients without its knowledge. The firm did not know who had provided the clients with its bank details. Once the firm became aware, it informed clients not to send funds until the required customer due diligence had been completed.

It was found that the firm itself had assessed the money laundering risks of these matters as âhighâ and so was required to conduct enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring. It implemented what it described as a âquadruple lockâ process of needing photo ID, confirmation of address, a copy of the clientâs bank statement and an online check.

But in 43 of the matters it was found the firm failed to conduct adequate checks before funds were deposited and failed to do ongoing monitoring.

The SRA acknowledged, in terms of mitigation, that client account details were given out without the firmâs knowledge, and that the firm put in place processes to mitigate the identified breaches.

The regulator also noted that retrospective customer due diligence was made following receipt of the monies on all but one client, the misconduct had not been repeated since and the firm had assisted the SRA throughout the investigation. There was no reason to suspect that any dubious transactions, which bear the hallmarks of money laundering, had taken place either.

The Â£19,200 fine was calculated as 0.2% of the firmâs Â£16m turnover for the relevant period, discounted to take account of mitigation. Taylor Vinters will also pay Â£5,800 costs.",am

Saraki is facing 13 counts of false declaration of assets and is due to be tried by the Court of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). He denies all the charges and went to the Court of Appeal to challenge the jurisdiction of the CCT, the BBC reports. When the Court of Appeal dismissed his challenge on October 30, 2015, Nigeria's Premium Times reports, Saraki appealed to the Supreme Court on November 4, 2015.

On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's ruling.

Saraki is the third-highest ranking political officer in the country and could be banned from holding any political officer for 10 years if he is found guilty. He will now face trial at the CCT, though a date has not yet been set.

The Senate president expressed his disappointment at the ruling but ""believes he will have his day in the court to prove his innocence,"" a statement issued by Saraki's media advisor Yusuph Olaniyonu on Friday said.

Among the allegations against Saraki are that he held a foreign bank account while in public office and that he acquired wealth beyond his legitimate earnings, according to Premium Times. The offenses violate the fifth schedule of Nigeria's constitution and are alleged to have taken place while Saraki was governor of Kwara state in western Nigeria between 2003 and 2011.

301,"Assets worth over Rs 22 crore, including a cinema hall and a hotel in Mumbai, oflate gangster Iqbal Mirchi's family have been attached in connection with a money laundering case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Tuesday.

A provisional order for attaching the properties has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

""The attached assets includes a talkies (cinema hall) and a hotel in Mumbai, an under construction hotel, a farm house, two bungalows and 3.5 acre land in Panchgani,"" the central investigative agency said in a statement.

The total value of the attachment is Rs 22.42 crore and it includes deposits kept in seven bank accounts, it said.

The total attachment in this money laundering case against the late gangster and his family is about Rs 798 crore as the agency had issuedattachments orders, including for overseas properties worth Rs 203 crore, in the past.

Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was alleged to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim in drug trafficking and extortion crimes.

""He (Mirchi) was an international drugs dealer and smuggler who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe,"" the ED had said earlier.

The agency alleged Mirchi ""indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai"".

It has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family and others last year to probe money laundering charges linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai.

This PMLA case is based on multiple FIRs lodged by the Mumbai police.

The agency had filed a charge sheet in this case before a Mumbai court in December and the court had subsequently issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi's sons Asif Memon and Junaid Memon and wife Hajra Memon.

302,"KABUL, Afghanistan â One of Afghanistan's most notorious warlords, designated a ""global terrorist"" by the United States and blacklisted by the United Nations along with Osama bin Laden, wants to come out of the shadows.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, now in his late 60s, says he wants a ""real and fair peace"" but with conditions the Kabul government is unlikely to even contemplate, such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and new elections in 2016.

The remarks reflect Hekmatyar's attempt to assert influence and gain new leverage in Afghan politics, but what role â if any â the once-feared warlord could play is unclear.

""Peace can be established and the fighting can end once the occupation is over, foreign forces leave and the people of the Afghan nation are given the right to choose their own destiny and establish their own choice of government and governance,"" Hekmatyar said.

The comments were provided to The Associated Press this week after being videotaped in Hekmatyar's hiding place, presumed to be somewhere in Pakistan, where he moved to after being ejected from Iran following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that removed the Taliban from power. His associates insist, however, that the warlord is in Afghanistan.

Hekmatyar has led an extreme life; his mujahedeen followers have been responsible for the deaths of thousands during the devastating Afghan civil war.

In his student days, he was known for throwing acid in the faces of women who did not cover up. He switched allegiances on the battlefields, fighting first the Soviets, for which he received millions in cash and weaponry from Washington, then the Taliban.

In politics, he espoused radical Islam, served twice as Afghan prime minister and saw Hezb-i-Islami, the party he founded in 1969, fracture and abandon him. The party's military wing offered bin Laden shelter after the al Qaeda leader fled Sudan in 1996, according to the State Department.

But history has relegated Hekmatyar to the sidelines and political analyst Haroun Mir describes him today as a ""spent force, frozen in time.""

The size of any following Hekmatyar could muster is difficult to gauge. The last known attack carried out by his militant group, Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, was in 2013, when at least 15 people, including six American soldiers, were killed in central Kabul.

Afghan security analyst Ali Mohammad Ali says Hekmatyar can no longer run a private army because ""most of his people have joined the Taliban"" or other militant groups, including the emerging ISIS affiliate which has established a presence in Hekmatyar's former strongholds in eastern provinces bordering Pakistan.",am
303,"One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.

Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265n) of investors' money at Capital Group.

BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.

Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.

The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.

Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.

""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.

Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.

This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.

Leaked documents

The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.

It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.

Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.

Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.

In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.

Conflict of interest

An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.

Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.

""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""

The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.

'Complied with duties'

Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.

""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""

Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.

However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.

Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.

The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.

Controversial energy deal

Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.

However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.

Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.

Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.

Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.",am
304,"The Hawaii Police Department said Friday that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has experienced an increase in reporting of financial crimes by individuals and businesses.

Those include identity thefts, theft offenses related to credit cards, computer-related crimes, forgery and financial exploitation.

âWeâve certainly had an uptick in fraud-type incidents,â said Lt. Rio Amon-Wilkins of the departmentâs Criminal Investigations Section in Hilo.

For example, he said there has been increase in scam calls to peopleâs cellphones.

âAnd then thereâs been a fair amount of mail thefts â¦ people reporting that credit cards and loan applications were applied for and granted in their name,â he said. âThereâs also been a handful of cyber crime issues involving apps. Somehow, these mobile apps are being linked to peopleâs bank accounts, and (criminals) are able to withdraw money from there. Theyâre able to withdraw great sums of money from their checking and savings accounts, and tracing that is extremely difficult.â

âParticularly during crisis situations, there is always an uptick in bad actors who take advantage of honest people,â said Krishna Jayaram, a special assistant to the state attorney general. âDuring this pandemic, we urge our communities to exercise extra caution and follow the recommendations of the Hawaii Island police.â

Police say many of the offenses are sophisticated crimes perpetuated by cyber criminals through âphishingâ and âspoofingâ â which are fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords and financial information by electronic communication.

Forms of communications include emails, phone calls and websites that originate from an unknown source but appear as being from a known or trusted source. The goal is to gain access a victimâs personal financial information, or spreading malware through infected links or attachments.

With the heavy reliance of computers, mobile devices and networks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber criminals are exploiting the vulnerability of individuals and businesses through data breaches of financial accounts. They also are targeting online shoppers, as well as focusing on stealing stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and paycheck protection program payments.

âSocial distancing and lockdowns are not slowing the business of fraud,â said Kealiâi Lopez, AARP Hawaii state director. âThe pandemic â and having more people staying home and working from home â has given scammers more opportunities to come up with new ways to take your money.

âWeâre seeing it at AARP Hawaii in the kinds of emails and text messages weâre getting. For example, one of our staff recently got text messages that appear to be a package scam, something the Federal Trade Commission recently warned us about. Donât click on the links in emails or text messages. Even messages from friends or government agencies can be spoofed and may not really be from them.â

Package scams are a phishing scam where the victim receives an email saying they have a package waiting for them and contains a link. That link leads to questions that ask for financial and personal information that shouldnât be given to unknown parties, and also allows the scammers to download malware on the victimâs device that could steal passwords and financial information.

While not totally eliminating the possibility of becoming a victim, police recommend taking the following precautions.

Conduct regular checks of your banking statements for accuracy and report any irregularities to your financial institution.

If your occupation requires you to work from home, you should consider a separate router to separate your home and work network traffic and using the strongest security configuration for online protection.

When examining an email to determine its legitimacy, look for unusual phrases, grammatical or spelling errors, or transposing of letters in the URL, also referred to as the âweb address,â because these are often indicators of spoofing or phishing attempts.

Donât click on unfamiliar links or download attachments you may receive in any emails. Instead, delete them.

If using mobile or computer applications to perform banking online, set up strong passwords and change them regularly.

You should also set up âtwo-factor authenticationâ which involves logging into your account with your user name and password and requiring a time-sensitive code sent to the device which needs to be entered by the user for verification.

If you receive a mobile or land-line call from an unknown or unfamiliar number, do not answer it. Instead, let the call go to your voice mail. These ârobocallsâ often use applications to display an area code from your area along with a random or unused phone number. If you happen to answer the call or hear a recording, do not provide any personal or financial information. Simply hang up.

To prevent further robocalls, consider looking for a âcall-blocking solutionâ or download the âdonotcallâ app from the Federal Trade Commissionâs website.

Finally, if you become a victim of a financial crime, prepare a packet that includes your financial statements as well as documents supporting the crime, such as emails, invoices, receipts, and others, to turn over to police when reporting the incident. It is recommended that you also retain a copy of all of your documents for file.

âStay vigilant. Log into your accounts regularly,â said Amon-Wilkins. âIf you see any suspicious activity at all, contact the police and contact the financial institution. And I always recommend not putting anything with a check or anything with confidential personal information in your mailbox at home. You should take it to the post office.

ââ¦ It think itâs also a great recommendation for people to get mailboxes that lock, so when you do put mail in there, itâs a lot more difficult for people to steal it from the box.â

In addition, the AARP Fraud Watch Network offers resources and help for victims of fraud. Itâs available at aarp.org/fraud or by calling 1-877-908-3360.

âWhether they are phishing with emails from your utility company or calling pretending to be contact tracers, the bottom line is they are trying to get your data and your money,â Lopez said.

305,"Zimbabweans have woken up to news that Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri has died and while President Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the passing in a moving tribute to his colleague, it was the unsavoury reactions to Shiriâs death which stood out.

Prior to joining government in 2017, Shiri had served in the Zimbabwe Air Force for 25 years and is also the cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, whom he helped remove out of office after 30 years at the helm.

âGood Riddanceâ, said one social media user.

He died in the early hours of Wednesday, 29 July 2020, however many have been less than pleasant in their responses to his passing â citing his role in the army massacres, known as âGukurahundiâ.

Perrance Shiri and the dark history of Gukurahundi

As many as 30 000 people were killed between 1983 and 1987, by a brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) â as part of a crackdown on dissidents in Matabeleland North Province, a homeland of the Ndebele.

Thousands of Ndebele were detained by government forces and either marched to re-education camps or brutally executed.

Shiri was also reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans in the late 1990s and has been accused by Zimbabwean opposition politicians of overseeing military assaults on illegal mineworkers in diamond mines east of the country.

âBlack Jesusâ

Shiri infamously referred to himself as âBlack Jesusâ, reportedly because he âcould determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or notâ, said an anonymous source to the BBC.

âI am deeply saddened to inform the Nation of the death of the Minister of Agriculture, Air Chief Marshall (rtd) Perrance Shiri, a long time friend and colleague. Cde Shiri was a true patriot, who devoted his life to the liberation, independence and service of his countryâ, Mnangagwa said in a statement.

Shiriâs deputy Vangelis Haritatos, also paid tribute to him and said he was an extremely hard worker and was dedicated to serving his nation.

However Zimbabweâs former Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo said it was sad that victims of the massacre couldnât receive justice.

âItâs tragic that Perence Shiri has departed without facing justice over the gukurahundi atrocities he committed in Matabeleland & Midlands provinces in the 1980s; nor telling the truth about those atrocities to help heal the nation. May God rest Shiriâs victims in eternal peaceâ, he said.

Ousting Mugabe

Shiri was part of the Zimbabwean Defence Forces which surrounded the home of then President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 and subsequently demanded his resignation. The army hasmaintained that his ousting was not a result of a military coup, however analysts have disputed this, citing the nature of the transition of power to Mnangagwa. Shiri subsequently took up a cabinet post under the new administration.",nam
306,"A SERIAL fraudster who posed as a police officer and a solicitor risked vulnerable mums losing the custody of their children in order to con them out of thousands of pounds.

âCareer criminalâ Stephen Davey targeted women living in Warrington who were battling their ex-husbands for care of the kids in the family courts.

Liverpool Crown Court heard today, Thursday, that the 49-year-old began to frequent Legends Sports Bar in the city centre in December 2018.

There, he met a woman who was a friend of the victims â striking up a sexual relationship with her after telling her that he was a police officer and probation worker called Steven Burns.

The conman offered to put one of his partnerâs friends, a domestic violence victim who was facing a custody battle with her ex-husband for their five children, in touch with a solicitor called Simon Davey specialising in family law.

But this solicitor was in fact the defendant, who took payments purporting to be for representing her in court and in order to hire a private detective who would investigate her estranged partner.

He later stated that his ex-husband was going to be arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences and possessing indecent images of children, and that he would be deported.

Davey claimed he had won the woman full custody of her kids and a Â£45,000 compensation claim, but in reality nobody had been present to represent her in court.

Between January and April this year, he took an estimated Â£8,000 from her â convincing him to give her money which he said he would spend on an engagement ring for his partner, but instead used to buy tickets for Liverpool FC matches.

Davey took Â£500 which he said he needed for private health scans, claiming he feared he had cancer and that NHS waiting lists were too long.

He also talked this victim into buying a laptop and case for Â£360 before asking to borrow the computer for work and never returned it, while a PlayStation 4 and television she bought for nearly Â£600 were pawned at Cash Converters.

Another friend of the woman Davey had seduced was going through family court proceedings against her ex-husband.

She paid the fake solicitor persona he had created Â£475 in order to apply for a restraining order against her former partner â who had also subjected her to domestic abuse â but no such application was ever made.

The defendant even forged emails purporting to be from Warrington Borough Council âs executive director of families and wellbeing Steve Peddie and Merseyside Police chief constable Andy Cook as part of his scam.

None of the three women targeted by Davey can be named for legal reasons.

Defence barrister Tom Watson told the court that his client had left school with no qualifications and had worked for the ambulance service, but was made redundant.

Since 2015, he has been studying criminology and psychology with the Open University and had volunteered with the probation service.

Davey had volunteered with the probation service and had hoped to gain employment in this area, but a job offer he received was later withdrawn.

Mr Watson added: âHe does accept that these victims have suffered as a result of what heâs done and he does not wish them to suffer any further.

âThis court will look at his record and see something of a life of crime, and a life of a particular type of crime â he does not attempt to deny that, but seeks to give an explanation for his continued behaviour.

âHis criminal behaviour began when he lost his job and he couldnât pay his mortgage, and he turned to fraud â he got into a life of behaving like that.

âHe regards himself as having no worth, and his criminal record which has grown and grown is something which he is disgusted with and not proud of.

âWhen the offer of employment was withdrawn he went off the rails and moved back into his old behaviour.

âIt sounds shallow and hollow, but he does offer his apologies to the victims in this case â he knows his behaviour and actions have had this impact upon them, and they are right to be distressed and upset.

âThough he has a record that does him no favours at all, his remorse is genuine.â

Judge Robert Warnock handed Davey â who had only been released from prison for fraud offences in London weeks before he hatched his latest callous scheme â four years behind bars.

Sentencing, judge Warnock said: âThis was a concentrated campaign of fraud against two vulnerable women.

âShortly after you were released from prison, you targeted your two victims, each of whom were mothers to young children.

âThis case involves six young children involved in contested family court proceedings.

âYou created two false personas, purporting to be a probation officers and police officer as well as working for a solicitors firm specialising in family law.

âNeither persona existed â you convinced them that you were working on their behalf, but you extorted money from them.

âThe real harm in this cause is the effect it had upon the cases involving these children.

âYou are an imbued dishonest fraudster who has been committing these kind of offences for a long time â you have a total of 94 offences with 17 convictions, starting in 1987.

âYour modus operandi was extensive, complicated and nationwide.

âThe time has come for you to stop committing fraud and to stop doing harm to others.â

Davey â who was also handed a restraining order banning him from contacting his victims for 10 years â is now due to face a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing in the New Year back at Liverpool Crown Court, where he could be ordered to pay back his ill-gotten gains.

He is also barred from entering the Tune Hotel in Liverpool â where he stayed for nearly a year, but did not pay for his accommodation.

The dad-of-two left his possession in his hotel after being rumbled by staff, with investigating officers discovering items including a fake police lanyard among other items used in the fraud.

The fake police lanyard found in Davey's hotel room

Prosecution barrister Nardeen Nemat said following the sentencing: âStephen Davey is a serial fraudster whose behaviour showed a disregard for the havoc and heartache he created in the lives of the people he conned.

âThe women thought he was trying to help them with difficult family problems, yet he just made things so much worse.

âBy telling the women that his âsolicitor friendâ was dealing with the family court matters and that they didnât need to attend court, he could have derailed their hopes of maintaining custody of their children.

âHis behaviour was reckless and heartless.

âThankfully, the women found the courage and perseverance to support this prosecution and help the Crown Prosecution Service build a strong case â so strong that Davey pleaded guilty at an early stage.

âThe Crown Prosecution Service would like to thank these women for their help in this case and wishes them well for the future.â

Detective constable Laura Gilbert added: âThis has been a complex and wide-ranging investigation spanning multiple force areas.

âStephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

âHe is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.

âI would like to thank the victims and witnesses in this case for coming forward and exposing his predatory behaviour, and for the bravery they have shown in doing so.

âThey have played a vital role in Davey being brought to justice for his crimes.

âWhen arrested and interviewed Davey completely denied the offences, and showed absolutely no remorse.

âHis offending showed significant premeditation and he attempted to cover his tracks at every turn.

âI am pleased that this case has been brought to a swift conclusion for the sake of the victims and I hope that the sentence imposed will motivate Davey to reflect on his behaviour going forward.â",am
307,"South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabweâs former first lady Grace Mugabe in relation to an alleged assault on a woman in a hotel in Johannesburg last year.

Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of beating the âhell outâ of her with an electrical extension cord in a room at the Capital 20 West hotel in Johannesburgâs Sandton district. After the alleged assault came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity. That immunity was overturned by a court this year after Engels, a model, challenged the decision.

âI can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,â said Vishnu Naidoo, a spokesman for South Africaâs police service. He said police were seeking Interpolâs help to enforce the warrant.

There was no immediate comment from Grace Mugabe.

The two countries have an extradition agreement, but Zimbabweâs deputy minister for information, Energy Mutodi, told Reuters that Harare would not extradite Mugabe.

âI believe the government of Zimbabwe will not tolerate any harassment or degrading treatment on the former president Mugabe and his immediate family members,â Mutodi said, adding that he would need to consult with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on a final decision.

Grace Mugabe, 53, was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband, Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year.

She has denied assaulting Engels with an extension cord, saying an âintoxicated and unhingedâ Engels attacked her with a knife after going to see the Mugabeâs sons at the hotel. The South African advocacy group AfriForum, which represented Engels, has accused Mugabe of lying.

Mugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted. Elections in August were won by Mnangagwa, his former righthand man in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

The warrant comes days after a long-awaited report into the killing of six people by soldiers during a post-elections protest in Harare. On Thursday, opposition figures dismissed the inquiryâs findings as âan effort to whitewash the killing of innocent livesâ.

Set up by Mnangagwa, the inquiry found that the military and police were responsible for the deaths, but that the deployment of troops had been lawful after the police had been overwhelmed by protesters. The protests were âpre-planned and orchestratedâ and leaders from the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had incited violence, the report added.

It recommended that soldiers should face âinternalâ disciplinary measures if found to have broken their codes of conduct.

Jacob Mafume, a spokesperson for the MDC, described the inquiryâs conclusions as âbizarreâ, telling the Guardian: âThey say itâs the MDC that incited violence yet blame the military for shooting the people.â

Opposition leaders have denied the charge of incitement.

The violence followed relatively peaceful elections and caused significant political difficulties for Mnangagwaâs government, which has made strenuous attempts to convince the international community that Zanu-PF has forgone the repression and brutality it was accused of during its 38 years in power under Mugabe.

The inquiry spent three months investigating the circumstances surrounding the shootings, interviewing dozens of witnesses.

Despite widely published photographs and video footage that showed members of the Zimbabwean army firing on people, generals said under oath they did not believe troops had shot at people.

Brig Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the elite presidential guard, told a hearing investigating the killings that âif any gunshot wounds were sustained by the victims, it was not from my menâ.

Mnangagwa said his government would study the report before deciding on its next steps.",am
308,"Malaysiaâs anti-corruption agency has charged the former prime minister Najib Razak with three counts of money laundering as part of its investigation into the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal.

The charges â which Najib denies â relate to three transfers totalling 42m ringgit (US$10m) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB fund that US investigators say was looted of billions by Najibâs associates.

A money laundering offence carries a penalty of a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine of at least fives times the value of the proceeds of any illegal transfers, or 5m ringgit, whichever is the higher.

Najib arrived at the courthouse in a four-car motorcade accompanied by his children. He was dressed in a grey suit and sat in the dock looking calm.

Last month Najib pleaded not guilty to abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust, just two months after the allegation led to his stunning election defeat.

He and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have been barred from leaving the country since he lost an election in May, and the new prime minister, his mentor-turned-foe Mahathir Mohamad, relaunched an investigation into 1MDB.

The 1MDB corruption scandal, described as the biggest in Malaysiaâs history, saw billions of dollars allegedly embezzled and lavishly spent around the globe on luxury property, a private yacht, Hollywood films and extravagant shopping sprees.

Lawsuits filed in US courts by the Department of Justice allege that an estimated $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates. 1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries including Singapore, Switzerland and the US.

Najib has consistently denied the charges, telling local news portal Malaysiakini in June that his trial would be a âtestâ for the Malaysian judiciary. âI believe in my innocence. Therefore the only way I can clear my name is through a system that is fair and a system that is predicated on the rule of law,â he said. âEverybody [should have] a chance to prove themselves under the system.â",am
309,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will try Gu Kailai, the wife of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai, on charges of murdering a British man, state media said on Thursday in the latest turn in a scandal that has rocked the government in Beijing and could bring Gu the death penalty.

The contentious dismissal of Bo has already shaken the Communist Partyâs looming once-in-a-decade succession, and now Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun will be prosecuted for allegedly poisoning businessman Neil Heywood last year over âconflict of economic interestsâ, the official Xinhua news agency said.

âThe facts of the two defendantsâ crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial,â said the Xinhua report summarizing the indictment. âTherefore, the two defendants should be charged with intentional homicide.â

Gu and Zhang will face trial in Hefei, a city in eastern China, far from Chongqing, the sprawling municipality in the southwest where Bo made his political base and where Heywood died in a hillside hotel in November.

Bo has not been named as a suspect in the murder case, but he is separately under investigation by party authorities and could also face trial at a later time.

Political observers have said a failure to forge a unified stance on handling the divisive Bo case could affect the Communist Partyâs focus on working out the leadership changes that will be decided at the upcoming congress.

Bo, the 62-year-old party chief of Chongqing before his dismissal, was widely seen as pushing for a spot in that new leadership until felled by the scandal brought to light by his former police chief, Wang Lijun.

âAs big as this case is, the party congress will now proceed quite smoothly,â said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor of Chinese politics at Boston University.

âThe party has handled this case as one of one person breaking the law. The ideological issues have been pushed to the side, although that doesnât mean theyâre not there.â

TRIAL SEEN IN EARLY AUGUST

Xinhua did not give a date for the trial, but Shen Zhigeng, a lawyer who had been employed by Guâs family, told Reuters that her trial was likely to start on August 7 or 8. Chinaâs party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants, and Gu and Zhang could face the death penalty.

In London, the British Foreign Office responded to news of the indictment by saying it was glad the investigation was continuing.

âThe details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities,â it added in a statement.

âHowever we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely,â it added.

The indictment comes around a week after Frenchman Patrick Henri Devillers, 52, flew from Cambodia to China to serve as a witness in the case. Devillers was detained last month in Cambodia at the behest of Beijing because of his suspected business links to Gu.

Bo and his wife have had no chance publicly to address the accusations against them since Bo was ousted from his Chongqing post in March.

But shortly before his dismissal, Bo said that he and his family had been the victims of slanderous accusations by foes of his policies, especially his controversial crackdown on organized crime. Since Boâs sacking, supporters of his left-leaning policies and rhetoric have continued to argue that he is the victim of a political plot.

The removal of Bo has triggered rifts and uncertainty, disrupting the Communist Partyâs usually secretive and carefully choreographed process of settling on a new central leadership in the run up to the 18th Party Congress.

The congress, scheduled to be held late this year, possibly in October, will appoint that leadership. President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao will then step down from their government posts at the National Peopleâs Congress in early 2013, when Vice President Xi Jinping is likely to succeed Hu as president.

âThis just shows that the Party has put the Bo Xilai case behind. It shows the center is on top of this case and the whole Partyâs priority is the party congress,â Wang Zhengxu, senior research fellow at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, University of Nottingham, said of Guâs indictment.

Gu has been in police custody for months on suspicion of committing or arranging Heywoodâs murder, though no details of the motive or the crime itself have been publicly released, other than a general comment from Chinese state media that he was killed after a financial dispute.

Xinhua said that the economic dispute between Gu and Heywood involved her son.

After his dismissal from the Chongqing post, Bo was suspended from the partyâs top ranks in April, when Gu was named as a suspect in the November 2011 murder of Heywood.

The businessman was a long-time friend of the couple whose son had earlier studied in England with the help of Heywood. The son, Bo Guagua, graduated from Harvard University this year and is still believed to be in the United States.

Since Bo was ousted, he and Gu, formerly a powerful lawyer, have disappeared from public view.

âBoâs career has been over for a long time,â said Fewsmith, the professor of Chinese politics.

âI donât think itâs a surprise,â he said of the indictment of Gu, âbecause itâs pretty clear that they wanted to get the Gu Kailai case out of the way before the party congress.â",am
310,"Action Sanctions Individuals and Businesses Linked to Los Cachiros

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of seven individuals and five businesses tied to the Honduran drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros. The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization: Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros). In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization's drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.

""Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,"" said Treasury's Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin. ""Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are - drug traffickers and money launderers.""

Today's action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.

""Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers. We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,"" said DEA's Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.

This action marks the U.S. Government's second action against Los Cachiros in four months. In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today's action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.

In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime. Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.

The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization. The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

311,"As former Defense Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos prepares to spend the Orthodox Easter weekend in a police cell, a 103-page prosecutors? report has provided shocking evidence of an extensive money-laundering network that appears to have financed a life of luxury.

According to the report by prosecutors Evgenia Kyvelou and Eleni Siskou, the 73-year-old minister has pocketed millions of euros in under-the-table payments for defense procurements since 1997, with the frequency of illicit transactions peaking between 1999 and 2002. These activities were concealed with the help of close associates who ran three offshore companies to hide the money, some of which was used to buy the ex-minister?s array of assets, the report said.

The report lists all the transactions, including the names of the financial institutions involved.

Millions of euros? worth of deposits in several European banks, including 16.2 million Swiss francs (or 13.5 million euros) in Switzerland, have been linked to the procurement of Tor M1 missiles.

The three implicated offshore firms -- Cyprus-based Torcaso, Liberia-based Nobilis and US-based Blue Bell -- all belonged to Tsochatzopoulos, according to the report, but were run by close associates including his first cousin, Nikolaos Zigras, also a former minister.

Zigras is to face an investigating magistrate on Tuesday, as is the entrepreneur Giorgos Sachpatzidis and Efrosini Lambropoulou, an accountant and representative of one of the three offshore firms. A fourth suspect, Asterios Economidis, head of one of the offshore companies, testified before a magistrate Thursday.

The money laundering was conducted chiefly through the purchase of properties in Athens, according to the report, which notes that the transactions traced are believed to be only a fraction of those carried out over a decade or so.

One example is the purchase of the ex-minister?s luxurious home on Dionysiou Areopagitou Street in central Athens. The neoclassical building was purchased in 2010 by Tsochatzopoulos?s wife, Vassiliki Stamati, for 1.38 million euros though it had previously belonged to Torcaso and Nobilis, two of the offshore companies listed in Tsochatzopoulos?s name.

In a related development Thursday, Tsochatzopoulos?s daughter, Areti, denied media reports that gold bars were found at her home. She said that police seized 10 pieces of gold leaf, which weigh 99 grams each and are worth a total of 29,000 euros, as well as nine 1935 gold sovereigns that she inherited from her grandfather.

Tsochatzopoulos?s wife and daughter could also face charges in connection to the probe into the veteran politician?s property dealings.",am

Former Party of Democratic Action official Amir Zukic has joined a lengthy list of politicians from Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics blacklisted by the US for corruption.

The US State Department has blacklisted Amir Zukic, a disgraced former high-ranking official of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, SDA, for being involved in corruption.

Zuikic, who had served as a member of the parliament of Bosniaâs Federation entity for the SDA and as the partyâs secretary-general, has been on trial for alleged involvement in illegal public-sector employment since 2018, following his arrest the year before.

âIn his official capacity as a Member of the House of Representatives in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FBiH, and as the General Secretary of the Party of Democratic Action, SDA, Zukic was involved in corrupt acts that undermined the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina,â a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Milorad Dodik, the Serbian member of Bosniaâs three-man presidency, is among dozens of people from Bosnian and ex-Yugoslav republics who have been blacklisted or whose assets have been frozen by the US government.

314,"SINGAPORE: After her husband was hauled to court for giving illegal loans to borrowers including a client of hers, a property agent bribed her client to give a false statement for her husband's trial.

When she was nabbed and given her own charges for witness tampering, the woman absconded in the midst of her trial and fled to Malaysia on the pretext of attending to work-related matters.

Sally Lai Guek Ling, 45, returned to Singapore about a year later and turned herself in. She was sentenced on Friday (Oct 30) to two years' jail and fined S$78,000. As she cannot pay the fine, she will serve another three months' jail in default.

Lai pleaded guilty to four charges of instigating a witness to make a false declaration for use in the trial against her husband, offering this witness a bribe, conspiring with her husband to carry on a business of unlicensed moneylending and absconding from her trial.

Another four charges were taken into consideration.

The court heard that Lai was hired as a property agent for Salinah Ahmad and Sazali Ramli to assist in the sale of their flat in 2012. The couple was facing financial difficulties and had spoken to Lai about their problems.

Lai later introduced Salinah to Lai's husband, Kenny Tay Ann Siang, 46. Lai said her husband could give Salinah a loan, to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of her flat, without indicating the interest rate.

The couple agreed to the proposal as they needed cash, and Salinah borrowed S$30,000 from Tay over a few months even though Tay and Lai were not authorised to carry on a moneylending business.

In August 2012, Lai sold Salinah's flat for about S$270,000, but claimed about S$108,000 from the sales proceeds as repayment of the loan, with an interest rate of about 260 per cent.

In 2014, a senior manager with the Council of Estate Agencies lodged a police report in relation to the sale of Salinah's flat on suspicion of illegal moneylending activities by Lai.

The police investigated Lai and her husband, and Tay was arrested and later charged for unlicensed moneylending offences including the loan extended to Salinah.

HER HUSBAND CLAIMED TRIAL

Tay said he would claim trial and trial dates were fixed, but his wife contacted Salinah in March 2015 to say she needed Salinah's help for the trial. This was despite knowing that Salinah would be called as a witness in Tay's trial.

Between June and July 2015, Lai promised Salinah S$3,000 if she agreed to provide false testimony in Tay's trial, to exculpate him from the offences, and Salinah agreed.

Lai prepared a false declaration and Salinah signed it. However, her criminal acts were uncovered and Lai was charged in April 2017 for bribing witnesses.

Lai claimed trial to her offences and the trial began in June 2018. On the 13th day of her trial, she asked to leave Singapore to attend to work-related matters in Malaysia.

The judge granted this request, but Lai absconded and did not return to court for her trial on Dec 19, 2018. A warrant of arrest was issued against her, and she surrendered herself to the court in January this year.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yonghui asked for 27 months' jail and a fine of S$78,000, in default three months' jail. He highlighted that while Lai pleaded guilty, this was after she absconded in the middle of her trial.

SHE HAS SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS: DEFENCE

Defence lawyer Thong Chee Kun from Rajah & Tann asked for no more than 18 months' jail, saying that Lai's mental condition was a central theme of her mitigation.

""She has suffered from depression for almost 20 years,"" said Mr Thong. ""She was affected by her depression and her concern for her family.

""Based on 20 years of major depression she suffered, a lot of her actions were affected by the way she thought about the whole matter, by her desire to protect her family.""

He highlighted that Lai ultimately ""made the difficult decision to surrender herself voluntarily"".

""Against the backdrop of her mental condition, one can imagine the anguish and the suffering she had to go through while on the run. It was not an easy period for her, especially since she was separated from her children at the time,"" said the lawyer.

He said that while there was another lawyer representing Lai, Mr Thong and his colleague had represented Lai during her trial and was ""doing this at extremely low cost to help her complete the matter"".

He urged the court to impose a lenient in-default sentence as Lai cannot afford any fine.

""She looks forward to being reunited with her children ... and she wishes to start her life anew as soon as possible. She's also instructed us to apologise to the court and the prosecution for all the problems she has caused,"" said Mr Thong.

District Judge John Ng said: ""Madam Lai, I think the moment you stopped running, the moment you came back, you already started ... towards the road to recovering your life.""

He said she should be able to put this behind her within the year, as her jail term will be backdated to the date of her remand in January.

""You should be able to put this behind you, and as you wish, to look after your children and focus on them. Then please make your life in order after that,"" said the judge.

The trial for Lai's husband is still pending.",am
315,"A British bank moved money that may have been linked to terrorist financing, leaked documents show.

Standard Chartered Bank processed almost $12m (Â£9.4m) in payments for Jordan's Arab Bank from 2014 to 2016.

In 2016, Standard Chartered filed a report alerting authorities to more than 900 transactions that it suspected might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"".

The report raised concerns about ""possible terrorist financing"".

The payments were reviewed after a US jury in 2014 found Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the early 2000s.

The verdict was later overturned, but in 2015 the bank reached a settlement with 597 victims or the relatives of victims of 22 Hamas attacks in Israel.

In response to the leaked documents, Arab Bank stated that it ""abhors terrorism and does not support or encourage terrorist activities"".

Arab Bank said it was never notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions processed for its customers.

Standard Chartered said it took its responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously.

The leaked documents - known as the FinCEN files - were shared by BuzzFeed News with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and BBC News Arabic.

What was Arab Bank accused of doing?

Arab Bank is one of the world's largest Arab banking networks, with 600 branches spread across five continents.

In 2015 it agreed to a settlement with the victims and relatives of Hamas attacks carried out in Israel between 2001 and 2004.

image copyrightAFP

The previous year, a US civil jury found that Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and charities it controlled. This verdict was later overturned as the judge had incorrectly instructed the jury.

The 10-year legal case produced evidence that Hamas had used the bank to move money and pay the families of suicide bombers in the early 2000s.

Gary Osen, a US lawyer who represented the victims in the US lawsuit against Arab Bank, told the BBC: ""A terrorist organisationâ¦ can't move the kind of money that an organisation like Hamas needs to operate. You need banking services, and Arab Bank was simply the largest and most convenient route.""

Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by the US, Israel, the EU and several other nations due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence.

In 2005, after an investigation by US regulators, Arab Bank was no longer authorised to process US dollar payments. It was also fined $24m for failing to adequately guard against money laundering and terrorist financing, and properly report suspicious activities.

What do the documents show?

Banks across the world rely on major Western banks like Standard Chartered to help them move money in US dollars. The service is known as correspondent banking.

The FinCEN files show that Standard Chartered began an investigation into US dollar payments that it had processed for Arab Bank after the 2014 trial.

image copyrightReuters

In early 2016, Standard Chartered issued a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), which alerts authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing.

The SAR highlighted more than 900 payments that Standard Chartered believed might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"".

The payments were labelled as ""charities"", ""donations"", ""support"" or ""gifts"", but ""a large majority"" of them were made ""by individuals who could not be verified in the public domain"", according to Standard Chartered's review.

Other payments triggered ""terrorism"" alerts. Some appeared to be intended for ""Specially Designated Nationals"" who were under US sanctions.

According to the SAR, the suspicious payments prompted Standard Chartered's New York branch to ""[exit] its relationship"" with Arab Bank in 2016.

What do the banks say?

Arab Bank said: ""In every country where it operates, Arab Bank is in good standing with government regulators and complies with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws. No government or regulator has ever found that accounts or transactions processed by Arab Bank violated anti-terrorism laws.""

It said many of the allegations ""date back nearly 20 years"", and that the vast majority of the accounts involved had no known terrorist links at the time.

Arab Bank added that it had never been notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions it processed for Arab Bank customers. Although Standard Chartered stopped processing US dollar payments for Arab Bank, it continued to maintain a very good business relationship with Standard Chartered, it said.

Standard Chartered said it ""initiated account closure"" with Arab Bank shortly after the 2014 court verdict but that it was a process that took some time.

It also said an SAR ""is not an admission of fault on the part of the bank, nor is it conclusive evidence that wrongdoing has taken place"".

""Only the proper authorities are in a position to make that determination.""

It added that it took its ""responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously"" and that it had ""invested substantially in compliance programmes"".

It had ""nearly 2,000 staff"" monitoring suspicious transactions, who last year ""monitored more than 1.2 billion transactions for potential suspicious activity"".

The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash.

316,"Collin County Man Found Guilty of Financial Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme Victimizing Senior Citizens, School Districts, and Charities

Defendant Engaged in Identity Theft, Cyber Fraud, and Elder Fraud,

Laundering Money for Nigerian Co-Conspirators

SHERMAN, Texas âA 30-year-old Plano, Texas man has been convicted of federal violations related to a bank fraud and money laundering conspiracy in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox today.

Babatope Joseph Aderinoye was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering; wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and mail fraud. The guilty verdict came following a four-day trial before U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant.

âWe are committed to protecting East Texas victimsâand especially our senior citizensâfrom financial threats, both foreign and domestic,â said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox. âWe will hold perpetrators of these fraudulent schemes accountable wherever they are and will use all tools at our disposal to punish offenders and recover their ill-gotten gains.â

According to information presented in court, Aderinoye would obtain fake passports in the names of others. He would then use those fraudulent passports and the identifying information of others to establish false business entities and fraudulent bank accounts. To this date, 13 individual aliases and 12 business aliases have been tied to Aderinoye, and there is evidence to suggest more aliases exist. Once Aderinoye would open the fraudulent bank accounts, co-conspirators would engage in various business email compromise scams and telephone compromise scams to defraud individuals and businesses out of money. In these scams, co-conspirators would pose as a known individual and direct the targeted victims to wire or send funds to Aderinoye or the fraudulent accounts Aderinoye had set up. Once the money hit Aderinoyeâs fraudulent accounts, he would immediately withdraw the funds, transfer them to other fraudulent accounts, or wire them internationally to a bank account he had set up in Nigeria. The illicit proceeds were used to pay off co-conspirators and further fund their fraudulent schemes. From June 2018 through September 2019, over $6.7 million was deposited into alias accounts of Aderinoye, with almost all of those funds being withdrawn or wired internationally. The victims of the BEC scams included school districts such as Community ISD, Project 4031, a non-profit organization that helps families of the terminally ill, an individual whose identity was used to drain his retirement account, and an elderly man who had over $352,000 stolen from his investment account. The investigation is ongoing, as co-conspirators and victims continue to be identified.

Under federal statutes, Aderinoye faces up to 30 years in federal prison at sentencing. The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.

This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Wes Wynne and Will Tatum.",am
317,"A subsidiary of Goldman Sachs pleaded guilty on Thursday and agreed to pay more than $2.9 billion in a foreign corruption probe tied to the Malaysian 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was looted of billions of dollars in a corruption scandal.

In addition, several current and former top executives at Goldman will have to return to the company millions of dollars in pay and bonuses they had pocketed in prior years, a financial penalty for those in charge after the scandal unfolded.

Goldman Sachs Malaysia entered the plea in federal court in Brooklyn. As part of its plea, the company admitted that it ""knowingly and willfully"" conspired to violate U.S. anti-bribery laws.

The $2.9 billion includes payments to U.S. and overseas regulators. The penalties also include roughly $600 million in profits Goldman made off the 1MDB scandal that it will have to return. Goldman had previously reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the government of Malaysia.

Goldman Sachs' board of directors decided to claw back pay and bonuses from top executives, including current CEO David Solomon and former CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

The Wall Street bank is in talks with additional executives to return part of their pay to the company over their role in the scheme, including Gary Cohn, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cohn became president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs 2006. He left the firm in 2017 to become a top economic adviser for the Trump administration. His payout from Goldman upon exiting was roughly $285 million. Cohn resigned from his role at the White House soon after in 2018.

Clawbacks are uncommon

In total, more than $174 million in pay and bonuses are being returned to the company, the board said. The penalty is more than many expected, as clawbacks are not all that common on Wall Street. Wells Fargo executives in the wake of the bank's phony account scandal, and JPMorgan bankers tied to London Whale trading losses, were also hit by clawbacks.

""The Board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,"" Goldman's board said in a separate statement.

Malaysian and U.S. prosecutors had alleged that bond sales organized by Goldman Sachs provided one of the means for associates of former Prime Minister Najib Razak to steal billions over several years from a fund that was ostensibly set up to accelerate Malaysia's economic development.

""Sweeping international corruption scheme""

""Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than $1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York, in prepared remarks.

In court on Thursday, Goldman Sachs' general counsel, Karen Seymour, said that agents and employees of Goldman Sachs Malaysia had violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by ""corruptly promising and paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business for Goldman Sachs.""

The fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MBD, was set up in 2009 by Najib to promote economic development. It relied primarily on debt to fund investment and economic development projects and was overseen by senior Malaysian government officials, according to court records.

Najib set up 1MDB when he took office in 2009, but it accumulated billions in debts, and U.S. investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by his associates.

Public anger spurs election defeat

Public anger in Malaysia over the corruption allegations contributed to the shocking election defeat of Najib's long-ruling coalition in May 2018.

Two Goldman Sachs executives have also been personally charged for fraud. Tim Leissner, who was the chairman of Goldman's Southeast Asia division, pleaded guilty to money laundering and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Another Goldman executive, Ng Chong Hwa, also known as ""Roger Ng,"" will stand trial for money laundering and violating the FCPA in March 2021.

""While it is abundantly clear that certain former employees broke the law, lied to our colleagues and circumvented firm controls, this fact does not relieve me or anyone else at the firm of our responsibility to recognize two critical realities,"" Solomon said in a statement.

The Department of Justice bought similar charges against Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian national with close relations to Malaysia's ruling party at the time who was the central player in the 1MDB fund. Jho lived a lavish lifestyle in New York, buying luxury goods and even a yacht. Jho's whereabouts are unknown, although he's believed to be somewhere in China and out of the reach of international authorities.",am
318,"Former mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is one of the most controversial figures in modern Afghan history.

A former prime minister, he is remembered chiefly for his role in the bloody civil war of the 1990s.

Mr Hekmatyar is currently in a tenuous alliance with the Taliban, although both sides remain suspicious of each other.

In 2003, the US state department designated him as a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

Observers say his current willingness to hold talks with the Afghan authorities is significant as it may now put pressure on the Taliban to also start reaching out to the government.

Civil war

Mr Hekmatyar's mujahideen faction, the Hezb-e-Islami, was one of the groups which helped end the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

For a majority of Afghans, he was one of the heroes of that struggle.

But in the free-for-all that followed in the early 1990s, his group of fundamentalist Sunni Muslim Pashtuns clashed violently with other mujahideen factions in the struggle for control of the capital, Kabul.

The Hezb-e-Islami was blamed for much of the terrible death and destruction of that period, which led many ordinary Afghans to welcome the emergence of the Taliban.

The civil war also led to Mr Hekmatyar's fall from grace - he quickly became one of the most reviled men in the country.

For some time, Mr Hekmatyar himself enjoyed considerable support from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. But eventually Islamabad turned against him, preferring to give full support to the Taliban instead.

So like the other mujahideen factions, Mr Hekmatyar and his men were forced to flee Kabul when the Taliban swept into power in 1996.

Wild card

He ended up being given refuge in Tehran, where he lived a quiet life, waiting for his fortunes to change.

The Iranians may have regarded him as a potentially useful Pashtun card to have up their sleeve, but he turned out to be too much of a wild card for them.

His vocal opposition both to the Americans and to the new regime of President Hamid Karzai was an embarrassment to the Iranian government, which threw its official weight behind Mr Karzai.

In February 2002, the Iranian authorities expelled Mr Hekmatyar and closed down the offices of his Hezb-e-Islami in Tehran.

They accused him of abusing Iranian hospitality with his comments vowing to fight the Karzai administration.

He returned to an undisclosed location in Afghanistan following threats by the Afghan government to arrest him and try him for war crimes.

In March of the same year he offered an olive branch to Mr Karzai.

A spokesman for Hezb-e-Islami in Pakistan said Mr Hekmatyar was now giving full support to the Karzai administration, although the warlord's whereabouts remained a mystery.

Missile attack

Soon after, however, the Afghan administration arrested 160 people in Kabul in a suspected anti-government plot.

The government said the detainees had been conspiring to plant bombs in Kabul and that most were members of Hezb-e-Islami.

Mr Hekmatyar remained elusive. In May 2002, the CIA reportedly spotted him in the Shegal Gorge, near Kabul, and tried to kill him with a missile from an unmanned spy plane. It missed.

The US continued to tighten the screw and was reportedly behind the arrest in Islamabad in October of Mr Hekmatyar's son, Ghairat Baheer.

Mr Hekmatyar's response was defiance. At the end of that year, he warned that a holy war would be stepped up against international troops in Afghanistan.

His message was distributed along the Afghan-Pakistan border to drum up recruits.

The message read: ""Hezb-e-Islami will fight our jihad until foreign troops are gone from Afghanistan and Afghans have set up an Islamic government.""

Attacks

Since then, Mr Hekmatyar has slowly and steadily rebuilt his power base, especially in eastern Afghanistan.

He has also continued to reiterate his ties to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

In a 2006 interview, he claimed his fighters had helped Osama Bin Laden escape from Tora Bora.

At the moment, his insurgents are strongest around Kunar and Nagarhar.

They have also been involved in some audacious attacks in Kabul, including an attempt on the life of President Hamid Karzai in April 2008.

Independent analysts say he is currently one of the three most important insurgent leaders, along with Mullah Omar and another Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani.",am
319,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States blacklisted four men and their companies based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, for purported ties to an organization accused of laundering money for drug traffickers and Chinese, Colombian and Mexican crime groups.

Among them was Pakistani national Obaid Khanani, whose father Altaf Khanani was arrested by U.S. authorities in September 2015 and accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of laundering billions of dollars for the Taliban and other groups.

The department said in a statement that Obaid Khanani, 29, continued to help lead his fatherâs money laundering organization after the arrest. Altaf Khanani is set to be tried on money laundering charges in Miami this month, according to federal court records.

Another man on the list, Hozaifa Khanani, also 29, is Altaf Khananiâs nephew and was involved in real estate investments on behalf of his uncleâs organization, the Treasury Department said. Muhammad Javed Khanani, Altaf Khananiâs brother, was âheavily involved in laundering criminal proceeds via money service businessesâ Treasury said. It said a fourth man, Atif Polani, helped move funds on behalf of Khananiâs organization.

The sanctions block any assets the men or companies might have had in the United States, and bars Americans from dealing with them.

The 82-year-old former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was questioned for over six hours on October 19 in the case.

After the questioning on Monday, Abdullah had said he was not worried and would cooperate in the probe.

The last round of questioning took place four days after Jammu and Kashmir's mainstream political parties, including the NC and the PDP, met at Abdullah's residence and formed the People's Alliance for 'Gupkar Declaration'.

ED officials said Abdullah's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as in the past. He was questioned for the first time in July last year in Chandigarh.

The ED is understood to be questioning Abdullah about his role and decisions taken when the alleged fraud took place in the association when he was the JKCA president.

The agency's case is based on an FIR filed by the CBI, which booked former JKCA office-bearers, including general secretary Mohammed Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza.

The CBI had also filed a charge sheet in 2018 against Abdullah, Khan, Mirza as well as former JKCA treasurer Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali and former accountants Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh for the ""misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore"" from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to promote the sport in the erstwhile state between 2002 and 2011.

His lawyer has not yet commented.

Mr Valladares' father, who is the Guatemalan ambassador to London, said the accusations were baseless and part of a smear campaign by drug dealers.

Acisclo Valladares Molina said a drug trafficker was setting up his son in revenge for the role the now-ambassador played when he was prosecutor-general of Guatemala in the 1990s in paving the way for the extradition of drug smugglers to the US.

""All the extraditions of drug traffickers are based on the legal opinion I issued as Prosecutor-General of the Nation (1994-1998). Sufficient reason for revenge,"" Mr Valladares Molina tweeted in Spanish.

The whereabouts of Mr Valladares junior are not known.

South Florida federal prosecutors have charged Mr Valladares Urruela with ""helping to launder close to $10 million of illegal drug proceeds and other ill-gotten money"". The prosecutors allege that ""during a four-year conspiracy, Valladares Urruela enabled the illegal drug trade by creating a demand for untraceable cash, cash that Valladares Urruela used to bribe corrupt Guatemalan politicians"".

This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider whom improperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of Syrian regime officials. This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

""Rami Makhluf has used intimidation and his close ties to the Asad regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians,"" said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The Asad regime's cronyism and corruption has a corrosive effect, disadvantaging innocent Syrian businessmen and entrenching a regime that pursues oppressive and destabilizing policies, including beyond Syria's borders, in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories.""

Syria is well known for its corrupt business environment, which denies the Syrian people economic prosperity and other freedoms. The considerable role the Asad family, their inner circle, and the Syrian security services exert over the economy, coupled with the absence of a free judicial system and the lack of transparency, concentrates wealth in the hands of certain classes and individuals. In turn, these classes and individuals depend upon this corrupt system for their success and fortune. Syrians without these connections are unable to improve their economic standing, and suffer as a result of policies implemented by an unaccountable regime.

President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13460 on February 13, 2008 to take additional measures to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by certain conduct of the Government of Syria.

This new authority builds on E.O. 13338, which was issued by President Bush in May 2004, by targeting activities that entrench and enrich the Syrian regime and its cohorts thereby enabling the regime to continue to engage in threatening behavior, including actions that undermine efforts to stabilize Iraq. Corruption by the regime also reinforces efforts that deny the people of Syria political freedoms and economic prosperity, undercut peace and stability in the region, fund terrorism and violence, and undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon.

Pursuant to E.O. 13460, any assets that Makhluf holds under U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in business or transactions with Makhluf.

Rami Makhluf is a powerful Syrian businessman who amassed his commercial empire by exploiting his relationships with Syrian regime members. Makhluf has manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals. He employed these techniques when trying to acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign companies in Syria and to obtain contract awards.

Makhluf is the maternal cousin of President Bashar al-Asad and through this relationship, Makhluf has become a focal point of Syria's telecommunications, commercial, oil, gas and banking sectors. Despite President Asad's highly publicized anti-corruption campaigns, Makhluf remains one of the primary centers of corruption in Syria.

Makhluf's influence with certain Syrian government officials has led to his being able to control the issuance of certain types of profitable commodities contracts. His close business associations with some Syrian cabinet ministers have enabled him to gain access to lucrative oil exploration and power plant projects. Makhluf's preferential access to Syrian economic sectors has led to complaints about him from members of the Syrian business community.

Makhluf is the brother of Syrian General Intelligence Directorate official Hafiz Makhluf, who was previously designated under E.O. 13441.",am
323,"SALT LAKE CITY â After nine years of court wrangling, including a dismissal and a mistrial, a Utah real estate investor accused of bilking investors out of tens of millions of dollars appears headed to prison.

A jury found Claud R. ""Rick"" Koerber guilty of 15 counts of wire fraud, fraud in the offer and sale of securities and money laundering Thursday after a three-week trial in U.S. District Court. The eight-man, four-woman jury acquitted him on two tax evasion charges.

Federal prosecutors say it's one of biggest Ponzi schemes in state history. U.S. Attorney John Huber called it ""emblematic"" of the types of fraud in Utah.

""Mr. Koerber, using talents that he has, gathered up almost $100 million dollars of investors' money. He used a substantial portion of that to repay other investors under the guise of interest payments. It was all a fraud. It was all a swindle,"" Huber said.

Koerber, who has profusely proclaimed his innocence throughout the long running case, did not immediately emerge from the courthouse for comment. He has maintained that he defrauded no one but ran a profitable business and was singled out by bureaucrats angered by his radio show, ""The Free Capitalist.""

Judge Frederic Block scheduled a sentencing hearing for Jan. 21. Prosecutors will make a sentencing recommendation over the next few months. Koerber will remain free from custody in the interim.

""It's in your best interest to behave yourself,"" the judge told him.

""There won't be any problems, your honor,"" Koerber replied.

The indictment alleged Koerber used his businesses â Founders Capital, and related companies Franklin Squires Investments and Franklin Squires Cos. â as a $100 million Ponzi scheme from 2004 to 2008. Prosecutors say about half the money was ""redistributed"" to other investors.

While investors believed their money would be used in secure real estate investments, Koerber spent it instead on luxury sports cars, producing a low-budget horror movie and his own lavish living, according to federal prosecutors.

Huber said it would be difficult to get investors' money back because much of it is gone.

Federal prosecutors first filed charges against Koerber in 2009.

Judge Clark Waddoups dismissed the case before it reached a jury in 2014, citing a ""pattern of widespread and continuous misconduct"" and violations of the Speedy Trial Act.

Prosecutors went on to file charges against Koerber a second time, but after weeks of testimony and seven days of deliberations last year, the jury couldn't reach a unanimous decision. Judge David Nuffer declared a mistrial, leaving the door open for prosecutors to refile the case.

Huber said it was worth the resources spent over the past nine years to get a conviction.

""It's always worth it to seek justice and to find justice,"" he said, adding federal agents and prosecutors would not let go of the case.

Huber said every trial, jury and judge is different, so it's hard to pin down how the second trial ended with a conviction.

""We know from our review that the majority of the jurors in the past case saw it our way, but that's the beauty of this system, that someone who's accused of a crime has the community judging them and not a prosecutor,"" he said.",am
324,"Former Helsinki narcotics chief Jari Aarnio is facing a homicide charge for his alleged involvement in the contract killing of Volka Ãnsal in Vuosaari, Helsinki on 16 October 2003, according to a statement by Deputy Prosecutor General Jukka Rappe.

Authorities suspect that Aarnio received advance information about the planned killing, but did not act to prevent it. Aarnio was the head of the Helsinki Police Departmentâs Narcotics Unit at the time of the killing and, under Finnish law, can be convicted to a life sentence if he's found guilty of failing to prevent the offence from taking place.

In addition to Aarnio, former gang leader Keijo Vilhunen will also face a homicide charge.

New information comes to light

Four people -- three Finns and the Swedish man who ordered the hit -- have already been sentenced to life imprisonment for their part in the killing. The Deputy Prosecutor General is working with new information received since those convictions and now has reason to believe that more people were involved in the murder.

Ãnsal had stolen money from a crime associate after a robbery at Stockholmâs Arlanda airport and subsequently entered a witness protection programme, which he later abandoned.

Aarnio was sentenced to 13 years in prison for a slew of offences related to drug trafficking and official misconduct, and his conviction was upheld on appeal in June last year.

Both Aarnio and Vilhunen have denied having any role in the killing.",am
325,"A PRISONER from Renfrew ran a drugs smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone call and letter.

Craig Sutton, 37, mentioned his drug dealing in the letters and spoke openly about it on prison phones which should have been monitored.

He carried out the drug dealing in heroin and ecstasy between February 2015 and July 2017 when he was a prisoner at HMP Perth, then HMP Edinburgh and then HMP Addiewell.

The High Court in Glasgow heard that the offences only came to light on July 19, 2017 at HMP Addiewell when a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell to Sutton.

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said: âFor safetyâs sake prison officers began checking the surrounding cells including Mr Suttonâs which had been locked from the inside.

âOn unlocking the door they observed a number of people in the cell including the accused. A smell of burning was noticed and they were ordered out and the cell searched and a small quantity of heroin was found and drug related paraphernalia and a suspected tick list.â

Suttonâs cell was sealed and fully searched by police on September 8, 2017 and this revealed dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Mr McGuire said: âThis would be by arranging for third parties on the outside to conceal multiple quantities of drugs internally; commit high value shoplifting and claim to be of no fixed abode so that they would be remanded in custody.â

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 30, also from Renfrew, admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit Â£30,000 of criminal money.

Mr McGuire added: âThose recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and Ecstasy inside and outside of the prison.

âDiscussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamsonâs bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs. Regular mention was made of drugs which he had either supplied or arranged to have supplied and for which payment had not been made.

âThe money received into Williamsonâs account make it clear the drugs trafficked by Sutton were worth at least Â£30,000.â

Judge Lord Burns said: âThere was a time when letters were examined in the prison did that not happen?â

Mr McGuire replied: âThere are two possibilities â the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done or they were not monitored.â
Lord Burns said: âIt is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.â

He ordered the prosecutor to investigate.

Williamsonâs defence counsel Paul Nelson said: âMr Sutton cajoled her to let him use her bank account.â

Sutton, who appeared via a video link, was remanded in custody and Williamson was granted bail. Both will be sentenced next month.",am
326,"The US Treasury has added an alleged Sinaloa Cartel member linked to drug lord Juan Jose âEl Azulâ Esparragoza Moreno to its Kingpin List, as the authorities increase the pressure on Mexicoâs leading criminal organization following the arrest of Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman.

According to the treasury, Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, his family and ten of his businesses are involved in drug trafficking for Esparragoza Moreno who, together with Chapo and Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias âEl Mayo,â is one of the three principal leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel.

Cuellar, who has joint Colombian and Mexican nationality, began his career in drug trafficking moving cocaine to the United States through Mexico for Pablo Escobarâs Medellin Cartel. After moving part time to Mexico in the late 1990s, he began working for the Sinaloa Cartel.

The treasury identified six businesses in Colombia and four in Mexico, including several pawn shops, a hotel and an ostrich farm, as fronts for his drug trafficking activities. It also added a further six people to the list involved in Cuellarâs activities, five of them family members.

In a statement the Treasury said the move was the ânext stepâ in taking on the Sinaloa Cartel following the arrest of Chapo.

Azul has been on the Treasuryâs âKingpin Listâ since 2003, while the Sinaloa Cartel organization was placed on the list in 2009.

InSight Crime Analysis

With the Sinaloa Cartel looking to regroup following the capture of Chapo, the US and Mexican authorities will now be looking to capitalize on the moment to attack the groupâs remaining structures.

SEE ALSO: Azul Profile

To do this, they will not only have to target dismantling the organization left behind by Chapo, but also the networks managed by Azul and Mayo. While all three drug lords are considered leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, in reality their organizations are overlapping and complementary, but distinct.

In the months leading up to the capture of Chapo, authorities landed several blows against Mayo, to the extent that before the arrest it was widely thought Mayo was the primary target of operations. This latest move by the treasury suggests they also have Azul firmly in their sights.",am
327,"The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion PNB scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case.

The extradition case of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering, is expected to enter its final stages at Westminster Magistratesâ Court in London on Tuesday. The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case, during which District Judge Samuel Goozee will hear his defence teamâs arguments against the admissibility of certain evidence provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in order to establish a prima facie case against the accused. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, will stress that the evidence meets the required criteria for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system.

The jeweller is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of âLetters of Understandingâ (LOUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of âcausing the disappearance of evidenceâ and intimidating witnesses or âcriminal intimidation to cause deathâ added to the CBI case.

Tuesdayâs hearing follows two separate sets of hearings in the extradition case being presided over by Justice Goozee, the first in May and then in September, during which the CPS sought to establish Modiâs fraudulent actions and played videos in court in support of the additional charges. Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including further commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited.

The defence team, on the other hand, sought to not only establish that Modiâs actions related to PNB-issued LoUs did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his severe depression and deteriorating mental health behind bars. These were further ramped up at a bail hearing last week, when the court was urged to allow Modi to be shifted to a specialist facility under strict bail conditions. However, Judge Goozee turned down the plea, reiterating the concerns from six previous bail attempts that Modi remains a flight risk who would abscond or interfere with the case if granted bail.

After this weekâs hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities, it has been indicated that the case would move to a final hearing for the judge to hear the closing submissions in the case from both sides, either next month or early next year depending on the outcome of Tuesdayâs hearing. A ruling by the District Judge, which would determine whether the case can be sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to order Modiâs extradition to India, is expected by next year, a few weeks after the final hearing.

Modi, meanwhile, remains in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard. The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs. The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.

Modiâs team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His family history of suicide and severe depression have also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition, which would make prison conditions at Barrack 12 in Mumbaiâs Arthur Road Jail inadequate for Modiâs pre-trial incarceration in India.",am
328,"Seattle â A Bothell, Washington, man is charged in an eight-count complaint for operating an illegal money exchange business involving bitcoin, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. KENNETH WARREN RHULE, 26, made his initial appearance on the criminal complaint in U.S. District Court in Seattle yesterday. RUHLE is charged with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business, five counts of laundering of monetary instruments, and one count of conspiracy to produce and distribute marijuana.

According to the criminal complaint, RHULE came to the attention of law enforcement in April 2018 as someone operating an unlicensed bitcoin exchange business under the name âGimacut93.â At various locationsâprimarily Starbucks coffee shopsâin Western Washington, RHULE met repeatedly with undercover agents posing as criminals who needed to launder funds. Through their conversations the undercover agents made it seem they were laundering money related to human trafficking activities. RHULE agreed to exchange bitcoin for cash apparently knowing the cash was the proceeds of criminal activity. In fact, RHULE offered the undercover agents advice on virtual currency and how to hide the source of the funds. RHULE asked the agents no questions as required under the âknow your customerâ rule.

Even as he was engaged in the operation of the unlicensed financial exchange business, RHULE was operating a marijuana products business that has no license with the State of Washington. The facility, based in Monroe, Washington, manufactures hash oil and other marijuana products using the names HerbinArtisans, Heady.Watr, and KlearKrew. Electronic messages reviewed in the case indicate RHULE was exchanging various marijuana products for cryptocurrency. RHULE claimed that he was manufacturing in the Seattle area but selling some of his product in Florida.

Operating an unlicensed money transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison. Laundering monetary instruments is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to manufacture and distribute the amount of marijuana involved in this case is punishable by a mandatory five years in prison and up to 40 years in prison.

The charges contained in the complaint are only allegations. A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The case is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.",am
329,"Former Namibian Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Bernhard Esau, has been arrested following allegations of corruption and money laundering in the Namibian fishing industry.

Esauâs arrest on Saturday came in the wake of a joint investigation by Al Jazeeraâs Investigative Unit, the Icelandic State Broadcaster RUV, and the Icelandic magazine Stundin based on leaked documents provided by the whistle-blowing group, WikiLeaks.

Warrants have also been issued for the former minister of justice, Sacky Shanghala, former chairman of the state-owned fishing company, James Hatuikulipi, and Esauâs son-in-law, Tamson Hatuikulipi.

Al Jazeeraâs investigation exposed the roles of well-connected Namibians who facilitated Samherjiâs entry into the industry, in part based on the âFishrotâ archive released by WikiLeaks.

Fishrot is a database of more than 30,000 documents containing internal emails, memos, Powerpoint presentations and media provided by former Samherji employee-turned-whistleblower Johannes Stefansson.

Shortly after the release of the archive, Esau and Shanghala resigned from their positions as ministers.

191113161947877

The two were accused of receiving bribes in return for giving Samherji, one of Icelandâs largest fishing companies, preferential access to Namibia âs rich fishing grounds.

James Hatuikulipi resigned as chairman of the state-owned fishing company, while the CEO of Samherji, Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson, stepped aside from his post pending an independent investigation.

Preferential treatment

During his time as the minister of fisheries and marine resources, Esau developed close ties with Samherji, allocating it a significant portion of Namibiaâs fishing quota.

Whistle-blower Stefansson alleged that this preferential access to fishing quotas was given in return for âbribesâ paid to Esau, Shanghala, and their associates, James Hatuikulipi and Tamson Hatuikulipi.

191114153732937

According to the leaked documents, Samherji made payments from 2012 onwards to businesses associated with Shanghala worth close to $10m.

In return, the well-connected politicians appear to have fixed a bilateral fishing agreement with neighbouring Angola in order to provide Samherji with greater access to the Namibian fishing quotas.

âNo recollectionâ

Samherji is one of Iceland âs largest fishing conglomerates with an annual turnover of more than $700m. The company sells its fish to supermarket chains such as Marks and Spencer, Carrefour, Tesco and Sainsburyâs.

In a statement, Samherji said it took the allegations seriously and solicited the aid of an international law firm to investigate.

âWe are deeply shocked that Johannes Stefansson not only admits being involved in illegal activities, he is now also making allegations against colleagues. This is not how we do business. This is not Samherji,â Samherji CEO Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson was quoted as saying.

In a press release, Namibian President Hage Geingob thanked Esau and Shanghala for their âpatriotism and contribution to the work of governmentâ.

Geingob appointed acting ministers to replace them.

Warrants have also been issued for the former Minister of Justice Sacky Shanghala and several others [Sacky Shanghalaâs F acebook]

Following his resignation, Esau denied allegations of corruption and said âno one has presented [him] with any evidence of monies or favours that Bernhard Esau receivedâ in exchange for âduties as a ministerâ.

Shanghala had a swift ascent in Namibian politics, from being the chairman of the Law Reform and Development Commission to be the countryâs attorney general until he became the justice minister.

When Shanghala was first confronted with evidence against him, he told Al Jazeera: âI have no recollection of money coming from any relationship with Samherji.â

James Hatuikulipi denied all allegations of bribery. He said he was engaged in âprivate consultancyâ for Samherji, and that payments made to him were lawful and âsubmitted to the relevant statutory bodiesâ. He added that he had âno control overâ the bilateral agreement between Namibia and Angola, and was ânot a party to any conspiracyâ.

Tamson Hatuikulipi denied that all the money he received from Samherji were bribes. He said his âconsultancy feesâ were paid in return for introductions he made. He claimed, âAll my books are up to date, and all relevant invoices are traceable.â

330,"Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Leslie R. Caldwell, and Assistant Director Grant Ashley of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division announced today that David W. Delainey, former chief executive officer of Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, has pleaded guilty to insider trading.

Delainey, 37, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Kenneth Hoyt at U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Delainey pleaded guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with insider trading, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 78ff and 78j(b). As part of his plea agreement, Delainey has agreed to cooperate fully with the government's ongoing criminal investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation.

Delainey faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million at his sentencing, which will be scheduled at a later date. Delainey has agreed to forfeit all interest in more than $4.25 million in net proceeds from the offense to which he is pleading guilty.

""Today's guilty plea shows that the tireless work of the Enron Task Force is continuing to hold accountable those who participated in the massive fraud at Enron,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division. ""At the same time, securing the cooperation of the CEO of a major Enron business unit is an important step forward in the thorough and continuing investigation of this sophisticated corporate fraud.""

As described in the indictment and plea agreement, Delainey knew of and participated in aspects of a scheme by Enron's senior managers from at least 1998 through late 2001 to deceive the investing public about the nature and profitability of Enron's businesses and thereby to inflate the share price of Enron's stock. Delainey admitted that the fraudulent scheme included the improper reserving of hundreds of millions of dollars of unreported earnings to hide volatility in Enron's earnings and improperly set aside earnings for later use; the use of excess profits generated in one business unit's California energy trading to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of losses in another business unit; the manufacturing of earnings through fraudulent over-valuation of assets; and the structuring of financial transactions using improper accounting techniques in order to meet budget and earnings targets set by top Enron management.

Delainey further admitted that based on material non-public information in his possession, including Enron's fraudulent accounting schemes, he sold Enron stock for net proceeds totaling $4,256,006.67 at various times between January 10, 2000 and January 11, 2001.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigations Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. The Task Force investigation is continuing.",am
331,"Finlandâs Supreme Court has denied convicted former drug cop Jari Aarnio leave to appeal a 10-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of a welter of offences relating to drug trafficking and official misconduct.

In June, the Helsinki Appeal Court upheld a lower court verdict that found the once-celebrated drug buster guilty of smuggling hashish into Finland in barrels â resulting in the ""barrel case"" moniker. Aarnio was sentenced to 10 years in prison on five counts of aggravated drug offences, aggravated evidence tampering, witness intimidation and several counts of official misconduct.

The Supreme Courtâs refusal to grant Aarnio leave to challenge the appellate courtâs ruling means that his prison sentence will remain in force. Altogether, he will serve a 13-year sentence: 10 years for the drug and official misconduct offences and three years in a separate case in which he used his position as a police squad chief to purchase equipment from a company in which he was involved -- the so-called Trevoc case.

However the Supreme Court will continue to hear appeals regarding other aspects of the ex-cop's drug smuggling case. One of the appeals relates to a female defendant convicted on a series of drug offences, as well as an appeal related to the sentencing and dismissal of one of Aarnioâs subordinates. The court will provide a limited hearing of these challenges.

In the latter case, the district court had ordered the dismissal of Aarnioâs subordinate. The appeal court reversed that order, but the prosecutor appealed the higher courtâs decision. The individual later resigned from the Helsinki police department.

Apart from Aarnio, his subordinate and the female defendant, all of whom filed appeals, the Aarnio case features other central figures. One of them is the so-called ""Malmi woman"" who was sentenced to three years in prison for aggravated drug offences. The other was former gang leader Keijo Vilhunen. In both of those cases, the courtâs sentence remained in force.

New suspicions: Senior police officer accused of helping Aarnio

On Wednesday a new suspect emerged in the web of crime surrounding Jari Aarnio. The Helsinki prosecutorâs office said that it had laid charges against a senior Helsinki police officer suspected of official misconduct.

According to the charge sheet, the detective chief inspector in question had, at Aarnioâs request, checked to see whether or not police were in the process of obtaining information about Aarnio. The suspected offences are believed to have occurred between November and December 2016.

The suspect has denied the charges and the case will be heard later on in the Helsinki district court. Two other suspects were also under investigation for the same reason. Aarnio and another police officer are believed to have pressed the suspect to fulfill Aarnioâs requests.

However no charges were laid against Aarnio over these suspicions, as they would not have affected his other sentences. He had already been convicted and had lost his position as head of the Helsinki drug squad.

In the case of the other suspect believed to have acted in concert with Aarnio, investigators did not find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. During the preliminary investigation he admitted to asking his colleague ""to back Aarnio up mainly to calm him down"", but he received a negative response.",am

Syriatel is owned by Rami Makhlouf, first cousin and childhood friend of President Bashar al-Assad and the countryâs most powerful businessman. In the past decade, he has emerged as a strength and a liability of a government that finds its bastions of support shrinking and a figure to watch as Mr. Assadâs inner circle tries to deal with protests shaking his familyâs four decades of rule.

Leery of the limelight, he is alternatively described as the Assad familyâs banker or Mr. Five Percent (or 10, or whatever share gets the deal done). His supporters praise him for his investment in Syria, but they are far outnumbered by detractors, who have derided him in protests as a thief or worse. Sometimes more than Mr. Assad himself, he has become the lightning rod of dissent.

333,"Jerusalem (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was formally indicted on corruption charges Tuesday, just hours before he was set to meet President Donald Trump for the unveiling of the US administration's long-anticipated Middle East plan.

Netanyahu has been charged with bribery and fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption cases. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit submitted the indictment in Jerusalem District Court on Tuesday shortly after Netanyahu withdrew his request for parliamentary immunity, a request he was almost certain to lose.

Netanyahu has insisted he is innocent, calling the investigations an ""attempted coup"" driven by the left and the media.

The charges in court mean that Netanyahu will be the first sitting prime minister to face trial in the country's history. A trial date has not been set yet, but the legal process could possibly take years.

Under Israeli law, Netanyahu does not have to resign upon indictment. Instead, he only has to resign if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.

The Knesset was due to start debating Tuesday whether to convene the committee tasked with weighing the immunity request. Lawmakers appeared certain to reject his bid, a factor likely to have influenced Netanyahu's decision not to proceed.

The Trump administration's plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be released with Netanyahu standing next to Trump, in a powerful image for Israel's embattled leader, reinforcing his claim that this is a ""historic"" opportunity.

""At this fateful hour for the people of Israel, while I am in the United States on a historic mission to shape the final borders of Israel and safeguard our security for generations to come, another show in the immunity-removal circus is set to begin,"" Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page before his indictment.

Renewing his strategy of seeking to delegitimize the corruption cases and the investigation process, Netanyahu added: ""This is the continuation of a personal and obsessive hunt against me by the 'Anyone But Bibi' people. Instead of understanding the magnitude of the hour and rising above political considerations, they continue to deal in cheap politics that endangers a crucial moment in the history of the nation.

""I will not allow my political opponents to use this matter to interfere with the historical move I'm leading,"" he said.

Rival Benny Gantz, whose Blue and White party emerged the largest in the Knesset after the last elections, said Netanyahu cannot lead the country and deal with his legal problems.

""Netanyahu goes to trial. We must proceed,"" Gantz said on Twitter.

""The citizens of Israel have a clear choice -- a Prime Minister that will work for them or a Prime Minister dealing with himself. No one can run a country and at the same time run three severe criminal cases on bribery, fraud and breach of trust.""

Political deadlock

The charges against Netanyahu, which relate to three separate corruption cases, were unveiled in November.

Prosecutors say that in the most serious case, known as Case 4000, Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth more than 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to his friend, millionaire Shaul Elovitch, who owned the Walla! News website as part of his control of the Bezeq telecommunications company.

Prosecutors say that in exchange Netanyahu, who also served at that time as Israel's Minister of Communications, received favorable news coverage on Walla! as well as influence over the choice of stories and language used.

Netanyahu has maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing criminal proceedings, calling it an ""attempted coup"" led by the left and the media.

Meanwhile Israel has also been gripped by political deadlock, following elections in April and September, both of which failed to result in the formation of a new government.

334,"Masoud Dalvand (Freedom Star): In order to know more about the terrorist activities of the Iranian regime in the region of the Middle East and in the whole world, in addition to missile activities and support for militias and terrorist groups, the seemingly economic and commercial activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) must be carefully considered.

The IRGC intervenes like an octopus in all security, political, military, social, Internet and economic sectors, because it protects the dictatorship of the mullahs from overthrow by the Iranian people.

Most of the major oil and economic projects in Iran are under the control of this terrorist and corrupt force. Money from economic activities by the IRGC is spent on missile projects and the continuation of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the repression of uprisings of the Iranian people inside the country.

An important part of these funds is also paid to the accounts of the senior IRGC commanders because they are all corrupt and thieves. In one word, the IRGC is a corrupt mafia of assassinations and crimes in Iran, the Middle East and the entire world.

One of the companies owned by this terrorist force, is Mahan Air (an airlines company), which was recently banned by Germany and the United States. This so-called airline has its main task of sending weapons and militias and members of the IRGC to Syria to continue the war and protect the bloodthirsty dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.

The following article provides readers with information on this airline owned by the IRGCâs terrorist force. I invite you to read this article. Published on the official website of the Peopleâs Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK).

A look at Mahan Air, the IRGC-owned Iranian airline spreading death and destruction

Jan. 28, 2019 â Just a few days ago, Germany announced that Iranian airline Mahan Air is no longer allowed to enter German airspace. In response, the Iranian regimeâs minister of roads and urban development Mohammad Eslami said, âAll the companies and airline industry of the Islamic Republic are sanctioned, and Mahan Air is among them.â

On January 21, Reuters quoted German sources that Mahan Airâs license for flying to German has been canceled. According to Reuters, the German federal government cited âsafety problemsâ and the possibility of Iranian use of Mahan Air for âmilitary purposesâ as the reasons for its decision.

In a January 21 meeting between EU foreign ministers, German FM Heiko Maas said that Iranian Mahan Air transports weapons and soldiers to war-torn areas in Syria.

In a separate statement, German foreign ministry announced, âthis decision has been taken in light of the recent sanctions agreed upon by the EU Council after the [terroristic] developments in France and Denmark.â

In June last year, the Iranian intelligence ministry plotted a failed attempt to plant a bomb in a grand gathering by the Iranian Resistance. At least three Iranians were arrested in connection with the attack, one of them an Iranian diplomat named Asadollah Assadi, from the Iranian regimeâs embassy in Vienna, Austria.

Considering the recent developments, the foreign commission of the National Council of Resistance of Iran published a detailed report of Mahan Airs past record and its connections with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).

Mahan Air, while registered as a private company, has had vast links to the highest levels of Iranian officials from day one and has benefited a semi-official status of state-sponsorship throughout its life.

The Mola Almowaheddin institute, which describes itself as a charity, owns 100 percent of Mahan Airâs stock.

Mahan Air was founded in the city of Kerman, the capital of Kerman province in Iran. Mahan is the name of a small city 35 kilometers from Kerman. Ataâollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture and guidance during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, chose the name for Mahan Air.

Mahan Air was founded shortly after the Quds Force, IRGCâs foreign terrorist arm, was established.

Virtually all Mahan Airâs decision makers and major players are members of the IRGC and commanders of Qassem Soleimaniâs Quds Force. A short list of some of them follows:

Hamid Arabnejad, chairman and CEO of Mahan Air, is a very close friend to Qassem Soleimani
Hamid Aslani, currently advisor to Hamid Arabnejad, is a Brigadier general of the IRGC. He is a former member of IRGCâs SWAT teams and later became head of the human resources in IRGC. At the same time, he became the HR head of Mahan Air.
Hamid Asgari, heads Mahan Airâs catering through a company named Arman. Formerly, he was one of the commanders of IRGCâs 41 st division, known as the Tharallah Division. He is close to Qassem Soleimani.

Through connections in the highest levels of Iraqâs government, particularly Hadi Al-Amiri, former Iraqi minister of transportation and head of the Badr Organization, Qassem Soleimani organized Mahan Airâs flights over Iraqi airspace to transport weapons and equipment to Syria.

On a daily basis, Mahan Air conducts flights from Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Abadan to Damascus over Iraq to transport weapons, equipment and fighters to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

In groups of approximately 200 individuals each, Mahan Air transports militias, including Afghan nationals who have been hired by IRGC, to Damascus.

Iraqi militias affiliated with the Quds Force, are transported from Iraqâs Basra to Iranâs Abadan by bus, and from there flown to Damascus by Mahan Air.",am
335,"(CNN Business) John McAfee, the antivirus software magnate and former Libertarian presidential candidate, has been indicted for tax evasion.

McAfee allegedly failed to file his taxes for four years despite earning millions in income between 2014 and 2018 from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary, according to the indictment filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.

The indictment alleges that McAfee evaded taxes by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency accounts in the names of others, while also using the names of others to conceal ownership of property and assets including a yacht.

The amount McAfee owes was not specified in the indictment.

The June 15, 2020 indictment was unsealed following McAfee's arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition, prosecutors said.

According to an attachment to the indictment, if convicted, McAfee faces a maximum of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum of one year for each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and over $350,000 in monetary penalties, according to the indictment.

The cybersecurity tycoon was also hit with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, accusing him of making millions by recommending several cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Twitter without disclosing that he was being paid to promote them by the companies issuing the offerings.

He also ""falsely claimed to be an investor and/or a technical advisor when he recommended several ICOs,"" the SEC said in its complaint. The SEC alleges this gave the impression that he had vetted the companies involved and that he was willing to invest his own money in them.

""In reality, McAfee's tweets were paid promotions disguised as impartial investment advice,"" the complaint added.

The SEC said McAfee made more than $23 million from his recommendations, which the agency labeled as ""materially false and misleading for several reasons.""",am
336,"Mostafa Mahamed (born 14 February 1984, Port Said, Egypt), [1] known as Sheikh Abu Sulayman al-Muhajir (or Mostafa Farag) [2] is an Egyptian-born Australian Muslim who is a senior member of al-Qaeda 's Al Nusra Front. He is a 32-year-old from Sydney's southern suburbs now living in Syria. He is believed to be the highest ranking Australian member of al-Qaeda. [3]

Abu Sulayman was born Mostafa Mohamed in Egypt and migrated with his family to Australia soon after his birth. In 1985, he was granted an Australian passport. He was raised in Sydney 's predominantly Anglophone southern suburbs and was reportedly the only Muslim at his primary school. [3]

Abu Sulayman reportedly was devoted to Islam from early in his life and set up the first students' Islamic society at his school. [3]

He later became a preacher in Bankstown in Sydney's Western Suburbs, at the now defunct Al-Risalah centre. [4] [5]

Islamist militancy[ edit ]

By the early 2000s, he was associated with a small group of fundamentalists within Sydney's Muslim community. In 2003, those associations brought him to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He was approached by ASIO officers and asked to provide information about a small group of Sydney men he knew, but he refused. Two years later those men were arrested in Operation Pendennis. He was seen appearing at court to support some of the men, who were convicted of planning terrorism. [3]

Abu Sulayman was also close to Bilal Khazal, an Al-Qaeda member who had travelled to Afghanistan and met Osama bin Laden. This supports what is commonly supposed, that he was associated with Al-Qaeda long before his travel to Syria. When Khazal returned to Australia he became a key facilitator for Australians who wanted to join Al Qaeda. He was also an associate of Houssam Sabbagh, a Lebanese al-Qaeda leader in Tripoli, Lebanon who lived in Sydney from 1989 to 2005. [3]

Move to Syria[ edit ]

Abu Sulayman arrived in Syria in late 2012 and soon after was appointed as one of the most senior religious scholars within Jabhat al-Nusra. [3]

According to The Australian, Abu Sulayman was threatened by Australian Jihadist Khaled Sharrouf. [6]

Sulayman reportedly has three children and a wife, whom he left behind in Sydney. [5]

US and Australian sanctions[ edit ]

In May 2016, the United States declared Abu Sulayman a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist."" [3] However, The Australian reported that Abu Sulayman was put on a US ""kill list"" a few years before. [6]

In August 2015, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop included Abu Sulayman on Australia's counter-terrorism sanctions list. In a statement released by the Australian Foreign Minister's office, Bishop maintains that Abu Sulayman has solicited funds to finance Al-Nusrah Front's terrorist activities and has recruited Australians to travel to Syria to join the ""terror "".

337,"PHOENIX - Drug Enforcement (DEA) Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman announced today the unsealing of an indictment against Jose Guadalupe Tapia-Quintero, 42, a Mexican national and high ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Tapia-Quintero was indicted by a federal grand jury in February 2013 on various counts including Conspiracy to Distribute Methamphetamine with Intent to Import, Conspiracy to Possess with the Intent to Distribute Methamphetamine and Conspiracy to Commit Concealment Money Laundering.

âOur strategy of targeting the highest level of the Sinaloa Cartel continues to pay off,â said DEA Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman. âDEA and our law enforcement partners on both sides of the border remain committed to using every law enforcement tool to attack these criminal organizations so they are put out of business, and their leaders are brought to justice.â

Jose Guadalupe Tapia-Quintero, aka âLupeâ, is a resident of Sinaloa, Mexico and owned various businesses including bus and tractor-trailer companies in Mexico. As a transportation coordinator for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, Tapia Quintero used his businesses to move large quantities of methamphetamine at a time from the interior of Mexico to the U.S/Mexico border including Arizona.

Tapia-Quintero, a trusted ally of the Sinaloa Cartel, controlled key drug distribution routes from Sinaloa, Mexico to destination points along the Southwest Border

In total, the long term investigation has resulted in seizure of 148.5 pounds of Methamphetamine; 30 kilograms of Cocaine; over $770,000; and three arrests.
The investigation preceding the indictment was led by the DEA Phoenix OCDETF Strike Force and IRS Criminal Investigation with the assistance of the DEA Special Operations Division, Scottsdale Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

The DEA Phoenix OCDETF Strike Force brings a synergy to drug trafficking investigations by combining, side-by-side, the resources and expertise of all participating investigative agents and prosecutors. By coordinating their efforts in that way, OCDETF Strike Force has achieved great success against the major Mexican cartels.

An indictment is simply a method by which a person is charged with criminal activity and raises no inference on guilt. An individual is presumed innocent until competent evidence is presented to a jury that established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.",am
338,"Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar, who was arrested and charged with racketeering last month in an ongoing pay-to-play probe, now faces additional charges including bribery and money laundering, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

The new charges were included in a 34-count grand jury indictment expanding on earlier allegations that Huizar headed up a criminal enterprise that leveraged his power at City Hall for financial gain, aiding real estate developers who handed over bribes including cash, free flights, casino chips and other perks.

The 113-page indictment also includes claims that others conspired with Huizar in the scheme, including a former deputy mayor who previously headed the Department of Building and Safety. Federal prosecutors allege that Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million in illicit financial benefits.

He is the fifth person to be charged in the ongoing investigation, which has netted guilty pleas from former Huizar aide George Esparza, real estate consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim and former Councilman Mitchell Englander.

The indictment alleges that Huizar tried to cover up the illicit money in several ways, including guiding his aide on how to avoid bank reporting requirements and using family members to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. It also alleges that he made false statements to federal prosecutors and the FBI.

Huizar, 51, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Attorneys for the councilman have previously stated that Huizar âintends to respond to the governmentâs allegations in court.â He is now being represented by attorneys from the federal public defenderâs office, one of whom declined to comment Thursday.

Many of the allegations in the indictment were revealed last month in a criminal complaint against the councilman, including that a Chinese billionaire planning a new skyscraper in his downtown district provided $600,000 in collateral to help Huizar quietly settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former aide.

But the document lays out additional details about the alleged crimes. For instance, the criminal complaint alleged that a businessman who wanted Huizar to introduce him to developers paid for gifts including expensive suits, meals and hotel stays for the councilman to meet with a woman with whom he was having an affair.

The indictment, in turn, lays out an itemized list of those alleged gifts with dates and dollar amounts, such as a âsuit and shirtsâ worth $6,000 on June 13, 2016, and âhotel accommodationâ worth $1,513.49 on June 19, 2017.

In another instance, the criminal complaint filed in June included allegations that a real estate developer provided political donations as part of a bribery scheme to win approval for an Arts District project. The indictment adds another allegation: that an executive with that development company talked to Huizar about hiring the councilman after he left office.

Federal prosecutors have not named the former deputy mayor allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise, but biographical details included in the indictment and criminal complaint make clear it is Raymond Chan, who has not been arrested or publicly charged in the case.

His attorney, Harland Braun, did not immediately provide comment Thursday but has previously stated that Chan did nothing wrong.

The charges that Huizar faces carry maximum sentences that could stretch for decades, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorneyâs office in Los Angeles. Money laundering, for instance, can be punished by up to 20 years in federal prison, while making false statements to a financial institution carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.",am

340,"CHICAGO (CBS) â A northwest suburban man has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for wire fraud.

Sean Moran, 39, pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Sept. 14, 2016, according to FBI spokesman Garrett Croon.

Moran was the owner and president of DCL Capital, Inc., an Arlington-Heights-based trading company, according to federal court documents.

One client invested about $750,000 with DCL Capital, according to the court documents. Moran lied to the investor about his investment of $225,000 made on Nov. 6, 2013, according to court documents. Instead of trading the money, he instead used it for his own expenses, including to pay down substantial credit card debt.

Throughout 2014, Moran lied to the investor and claimed his money was generating positive returns from trading, when instead he knew his trading of the remainder of the investorâs funds had resulted in substantial losses, according to court documents. He prepared and sent several false account statements to the investor, showing that his principal and profit was available and invested, when in reality he had either spent or lost a substantial amount of the funds.

For example, on Dec. 8, 2014, Moran sent the investor a fake statement showing an account balance of $818,900 in principal and a year-to-date profit of $35,753, according to court documents. However, in reality, he only had about $126,000 of the investorâs funds left.

Moran ended up losing about $600,000 of the investorâs money, according to court documents.

Moran, of Arlington Heights, was sentenced to 24 months in prison Thursday by Judge Harry Leinenweber, according to Croon.",am

Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman, also known as Abu Jibril, has been a close associate of Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, a.k.a. Hambali (QDi.087). He was Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)'s (QDe.092) primary recruiter and second in command - running JI operations and heading its regional âshuraâ before his arrest by Malaysian authorities in June 2001. He was also reportedly a financial conduit for Al-Qaida (QDe.004) in the region.

Abdurrahman has been part of the leadership of Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia (KMM, Malaysian Mujahideen Organization), which has close ties to JI and was established in 1995 at a meeting of Afghanistan veterans. KMM leadership has included Abu Bakar Baâasyir (QDi.217) and Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin.

Abdurrahman was elected deputy leader of the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI) in 2008. MMI was founded, inter alia, by Baâasyir and chaired by Ifran Suryahadi Awas who was the younger brother of Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman. MMI was associated with the JI organization in Indonesia, which came to be known as Mantiqi II and was headed by Abdullah Anshori (QDi.216). Anshori and Baâasyir used MMI as a financial conduit to support JIâs goals and to bring together the various like-minded groups within South-East Asia. MMIâs board members included Agus Dwikarna (QDi.111) and other JI members. Abdurrahman also controls Ar-Rahmah Media, a pro-JI video production company.

Abdurrahman and Agus Dwikarna were also part of the leadership of the Laskar Mujahideen and the Laskar Jundullah, two paramilitary organizations established by JI to engage in sectarian conflict in 1999-2001. The former was closely linked to JI and Al-Qaida.

342,"Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers and U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced the unsealing of a six-count federal indictment against Seyed Sajjad Shahidian, 33, Vahid Vali, 33, and PAYMENT24 for conducting financial transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit offenses against and to defraud the United States, wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. Shahidian, who was arrested and extradited from the United Kingdom, made his initial appearance earlier today before Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Vali remains at large.

According to the allegations in the indictment, PAYMENT24 was an internet-based financial services company with approximately 40 employees and offices in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, Iran. The primary business of PAYMENT24 was helping Iranian citizens conduct prohibited financial transactions with businesses based in the United States, including the unlawful purchase and exportation of computer software, software licenses, and computer servers from United States companies. According to PAYMENT24âs website, the company charged a fee to circumvent âAmerican sanctions,â and claimed to have brought in millions of dollars of foreign currency into Iran.

According to the allegations in the indictment, beginning in or before 2009 through November 2018, Shahidian, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of PAYMENT24, conspired with Vali, the Chief Operating Officer of PAYMENT24, and other individuals to commit offenses against the United States by violating the restrictions on trade and exports from the United States to Iran. On its website, PAYMENT24 sold a package to assist its Iranian clients with making online purchases from United States-based businesses, which included a PayPal account, a fraudulent âID card and address receipt,â a remote IP address from the United Arab Emirates, and a Visa gift card. The PAYMENT24 website also offered its clients advice on how to create accounts with a foreign identity and how to avoid restrictions on foreign websites, including advising clients to ânever attempt to log into those sites with an Iranian IP address.â

As part of the scheme, Shahidian and Vali made material misrepresentations and omissions to United States-based businesses regarding the destination of the United States-origin goods. In order to accomplish the transactions, Shahidian obtained payment processing accounts from United States-based companies using false residency information, fraudulent passport documents, and other false documents fabricated using the identity and personally identifiable information of another person.

Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized exports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States or by a United States person are prohibited.

This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Minneapolis Division of the FBI. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs secured the extradition from the United Kingdom with significant assistance from law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom.

344,"WASHINGTON â Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated two individuals based in Indonesia for their links to the terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT). Said Ahmad Sungkar has been involved in fundraising efforts for JAT and supporting JI operatives. Afif Abdul Majid is a senior JAT leader who has overseen the recruitment and training of terrorists in Indonesia. These designations are part of the Treasury Departmentâs ongoing efforts to target these organizations as well as disrupt their financial and logistical support networks.

âThe threats posed by terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiya and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,â said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

JI is a Southeast Asia-based terrorist network with links to al-Qaida. It has been designated by the UN and the United States since 2002 and is responsible for numerous acts of terrorism including the Bali bombing in 2002, in which over 200 people from 27 nations were killed.

JAT is also an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to JI. In February 2012 the State Department designated JAT pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, while the Department of the Treasury designated three JAT leaders: JATâs acting Emir Mochammad Achwan, JAT spokesperson Son Hadi bin Muhadjir, and JAT leadership figure Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba'asyir, who was involved in recruiting and fundraising activities.

JAT seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia, and has carried out numerous attacks on Indonesian Government personnel and civilians in order to achieve this goal. Abu Bakar Baâasyir, the founder and leader of JAT, and a UN 1267 listed individual, was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2011 for his role in organizing a terrorist training camp in Aceh.

Said Ahmad Sungkar

Said Ahmad Sungkar (Sungkar) is being designated for providing financial, material, or technological support, or financial or other services, to JI and JAT. Sungkar has been involved in supporting Indonesia-based JI and JAT terrorist networks over a number of years. Most recently, Sungkar conducted fundraising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.

Sungkar previously had served as JIâs media chief. Also, on several occasions, Sungkar has extended logistics support to JI operatives seeking to evade capture and provided extremist operatives with fake documents.

In addition to providing support and services to JI and JAT Sungkar was linked to a terrorist training camp in 2010 in Aceh, Indonesia, that was under the leadership of senior JI operative Joko Pitono (a.k.a. Dulmatin) and gathered militants from various regional groups, including some with links to al-Qaâida. The militants, using the name âal-Qa'ida in Aceh,â plotted to kill U.S. aid workers and Western tourists and attack churches and Western NGOs. Dulmatin was killed in an Indonesian police raid in March 2010.

Afif Abdul Majid

Afif Abdul Majid (Abdul Majid) is being designated for acting for or on behalf of JAT. Abdul Majid since 2008 has served as a JAT leader, overseeing JAT fighters. In 2012, Abdul Majid played a role in coordinating the activities of regional JAT leaders. Abdul Majid was a member of JATâs governing council, also called the âMajelis Syuro,â from 2008 to 2013.

Abdul Majid also served as the head of JATâs Central Java branch, as of late 2011. Abdul Majid in August 2010 conducted a swearing in ceremony for hundreds of JAT fighters, some of whom were expected to take violent action against the Indonesian police. In past years, Abdul Majid headed JAT recruitment efforts for a paramilitary wing that provided training for fighters, weapons experts, and hackers.

Abdul Majid has supported training activities for terrorist networks outside JAT, as well. As of early 2010, Abdul Majid donated approximately $2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp, including weapons and ammunition purchases.

The US justice department told the NBI the Iranian was indicted in the District Court of Columbia for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel âwith nuclear applicationsâ which were considered suitable for gas centrifuges used in uranium enrichment.

Money laundering

Records showed Khaki was also charged by the US justice department with money laundering and violating US laws with respect to the American embargo against Iran.

NBI records showed the Iranian was on his way back to Iran when he was arrested by NBI agents at Naia Terminal 1 on May 26, 2012.

Khakiâs extradition to the US did not push through, however, after the Iranian Embassy filed a petition in Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 21 opposing his extradition.

The Iranian remained in NBI custody while his extradition case was pending in the Manila court.

NBI foreign liaison chief Daniel Daganzo said Khaki suffered a heart attack around 8 p.m. on Monday and was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital but he succumbed around 11 p.m.

He said that with the death, Khakiâs case would now be handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.

348,"A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about Â£8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than Â£400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about Â£400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

Magistrates' court

Most criminal cases are heard in a magistrates' court. The magistrates are usually people who live in the local community, sometimes called justices of the peace. There are usually three magistrates who are supported by a legally trained advisor. Sometimes cases are tried by one magistrate, called a district judge, who is a lawyer.

Magistrates' courts are not as formal as the Crown Court, the magistrates do not wear wigs and only the ushers (court officials who keep everything running smoothly) wear black gowns.

Crown Court

Some cases are heard in the Crown Court. There are three situations where a case may be 'tried' at the Crown Court:

Serious crimes
Cases where the defendant (the person accused of the crime) has asked to have his case tried by a jury
Magistrates may send a case to the Crown Court if they feel they do not have the power to set a sentence as severe as the crime deserves

Cases at the Crown Court are tried by a jury. These are 12 people from the general public who listen to the evidence presented during the trial and decide if the defendant is guilty of the crime. The judge decides on matters of law during the trial, such as whether certain evidence is allowed to be presented. The judge also makes sure the trial proceeds in a fair way. At the end of the trial if the defendant is found guilty the judge decides the sentence for the crime (for example how long the defendant must spend in prison).

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.",am

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said its investigation would question whether Westpac, its directors and senior managers breached the newly introduced Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) legislation.

âAUSTRACâs statement of claim in relation to Westpac contains serious allegations that question the prudential standing of Australiaâs second largest bank,â APRAâs deputy chairman John Lonsdale said in the statement.

350,"Same way as they arrested Marry Mubaiwa â an open letter

Source: ZACC must now arrest Constantine Chiwenga â The Zimbabwean

Editor,

In this open letter to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which I will copy to the international bodies who have been concerned about the Zimbabwean situation, I will want to argue that ZACC must now move in to arrest Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, in the same way as the same body arrested Mary Chiwenga.

One of the charges Mary Mubaiwa has been arrested for involves externalizing foreign currency, a revelation made by Vice-President Chiwenga. Now that Mary Mubaiwa, the estranged former Army Generalâs wife, has also disclosed that the couple acquired properties outside the country, which have been registered in the names of family members and friends, some of the money used having been corruptly acquired from bribes given by business persons among other sources, ZACC must now move in and arrest the former army general. We are told by Mnangagwa and other Zanu PF heavyweights that no-one is above the law, so the Acting President must be arrested and prove his innocence in the courts of law.

The fact that the Acting President is now trying to persuade his estranged wife for an out of court settlement tells volumes. Mary should stand her grounds and refuse such advances from a cruel man who has tormented her so much. Mary needs protection from all well meaning people as she has some crucial information that could deal a huge blow to corruption by the top brass in the country.

351,"A fraudster has been jailed today for seven years for conning elderly and vulnerable victims out of nearly Â£3m in a âboiler roomâ fraud operation.

Mohammed Tanveer, 30, led an operation which cold-called potential victims and offered them the chance to invest in corporate bonds that were supposedly only available to private investors.

Victims were persuaded to invest huge sums of money - with one losing life savings of nearly Â£1m.

Tanveer was convicted of money laundering offences by a jury at Southwark Crown Court. He had already been found guilty of conspiracy to defraud in relation to the âboiler roomâ scam at an earlier trial.

Three co-defendants - Lucy Richardson, 25, Mark Bowman, 55, Mandy Cross, 59 - were also convicted of money laundering offences today in relation to money from the scam.

Mandy Cross, the mother of co-defendant Shaun Cross, allowed more than Â£160,000 to pass through her account.

Barry Spearing, 58, was convicted of money laundering at an earlier trial. Shaun Cross, 30, Ryan Weston, 27, and Philip Hunt, 32, each pleaded guilty to money laundering at earlier court hearings.

Victims of the high-pressure sales tactic scam were shown marketing brochures and company reports to support the legitimacy of the scam and promised large annual returns of between 8-10%.

To make the investments seem more legitimate they were told their funds would be invested in large blue-chip companies such as Thames Water, BT and Rolls Royce.

Once they made an investment, victims received a fake âdividendâ payment, enticing them into further investments.

If victims continued to invest they received further dividends.

However, once the victims decided to stop investing any further, the dividends were stopped and brokers became unavailable.

The scam also caused more misery for existing victims, returning to them a second time and demanding money to help them with a bogus âexit strategyâ.

More than 50 victims came forward as part of the investigation.

Alistair Dickson, from the CPS, said: âThis was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didnât exist.

âCommon to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable. Persuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told. The reality is that the gang conned their way to nearly Â£3m.""

352,"Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a âsyndicated criminal mafiaâ meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Policeâs revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;

571 Zengeza Township;

9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);

Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and

431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.

353,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. admitted its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in U.S. enforcement history, reaching multiple international settlements to end probes into its fundraising for the scandal-plagued Malaysian fund known as 1MDB.

Goldman officials helped spread $1.6 billion in illicit payments across Malaysia and the Middle East as part of a scheme that diverted money raised for development projects into an international spending spree on mansions and lavish parties, the bank said.

The bank agreed to billions of dollars in new penalties to the Justice Department and other U.S. authorities, as well as to regulators in the U.K., Hong Kong and Singapore. The payments brought its overall tab to more than $5 billion to resolve probes into bond deals it arranged for 1MDB.

The Wall Street giant will cut the pay of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and other current leaders and claw back compensation from his predecessor Lloyd Blankfein and several other former executives, the bank said Thursday.

A small Malaysian unit of the U.S. bank pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge on Thursday. But Goldmanâs parent company avoided a criminal conviction to resolve the investigations, as part a deal that allows the bank to put off any prosecution as long as it cooperates with ongoing U.S. investigations and submits compliance reports.

The deferred-prosecution agreement is a win for Goldman Sachs, because a conviction might have risked losing some institutional clients that are restricted from working with financial firms with criminal records. The bankâs shares rose 1.2% on Thursday.

The global resolutions announced Thursday conclude more than a half decade of investigations into Goldmanâs role in raising $6.5 billion for 1MDB in three bond offerings. To smooth the way for those bond deals, Goldman officials conspired with a 1MDB official to bribe Malaysian officials and officials of a sovereign wealth vehicle in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. Justice Department said.

U.S. authorities said that Goldmanâs misconduct rose to the bankâs highest ranks, despite its insistence for years that rogue employees were responsible. âThe scheme was principally carried out by senior officials in Goldman,â Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said.

In all, some $2.7 billion of the money raised for 1MDB was stolen by people connected to the countryâs former prime minister and diverted for bribes, a luxury yacht, fine art and even funding for the Hollywood movie âThe Wolf of Wall Street.â

The Justice Department settlement concludes one of the biggest bank probes inherited by the Trump administration. The bank will pay more than $2.3 billion in the plea deal, U.S. prosecutor Alixandra Smith said, the largest penalty in U.S. history for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Airbus SE paid $2.09 billion earlier this year to settle global bribery probes.

The case against the Wall Street firm focused on its fundraising work in 2012 and 2013 for the state-owned 1MDB, formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd. From about 2009 to 2014, the bankâs Malaysia unit âknowingly and willfully agreed to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by corruptly promising, and paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business for Goldman Sachs,â the bankâs general counsel, Karen Seymour, told U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn in a video hearing on Thursday.

Goldmanâs investment-banking group, led at the time by Solomon, collected $600 million from the bond sales.

Prosecutors in court filings described a corporate culture at Goldman that displayed a casual indifference to bribery, at least among a few senior executives.

In a statement of facts accepted by Goldman, prosecutors highlighted a call in which a managing director discussed with a senior executive problems the bank was having in securing an investment from an Abu Dhabi investment fund related to 1MDB.

The managing director said it was clear that a government official in Abu Dhabi was âtrying to get something on the side in his pocketâ from the deal. âI think itâs quite disturbing to have come across this piece of information,â he added.

âWhatâs disturbing about that?â the senior executive replied, according to the filing, which didnât identify the individuals. âItâs nothing new, is it?â

The suspected mastermind of the 1MDB fraud, a Malaysian financier known as Jho Low, conspired with bankers Tim Leissner, Roger Ng and others to bribe high-ranking officials in Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment Company, and a unit, Aabar Investments PJS, the bank admitted. IPIC agreed to be a guarantor of a 2012 1MDB debt deal, a role that helped the bond offering move ahead.

Bribes also went to the Malaysian government and 1MDB officials, prosecutors said.

At a February 2012 meeting, Low explained to Leissner, Ng and others that âgovernment officials from Abu Dhabi and Malaysia needed to be bribed to both obtain the guarantee from IPIC and get the necessary approvals from Malaysia and 1MDB,â they said.

Goldmanâs compliance employees were on notice to keep an eye out for any transactions that might involve Low, who was considered a significant risk. Yet in the 1MDB bond deals, they didnât take âreasonable stepsâ to keep him out of it, according to the statement of facts.

For example, Goldman failed to review electronic communications of members of the deal team for evidence of Lowâs involvement, which by 2012 wouldâve shown Lowâs role in the matter, the statement says.

Low, who has professed his innocence, remains at large. Leissner, who was the bankâs southeast Asia chairman, pleaded guilty in the U.S. to conspiring to launder money. Heâll be sentenced in January. Ng was charged with conspiring with Low to launder money. He has denied wrongdoing.

âThe board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,â Goldmanâs board said in a statement Thursday announcing the executive pay cuts.

The Justice Department penalty against Goldman credits more than $1 billion in fines paid to other U.S. agencies and foreign authorities. That includes $400 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $150 million to New Yorkâs Department of Financial Services and $154 million to the Federal Reserve. After disgorgements of Malaysia profits, the Justice Department places the total U.S. penalty at roughly $2.9 billion.

Goldman Sachs units will also pay $350 million to Hong Kongâs financial regulator, $122 million to Singaporeâs government and 96.6 million pounds ($126 million) to the U.K.âs Financial Conduct Authority, those bodies announced Thursday.

Goldman reached a settlement in July with Malaysia, which included a payment of $2.5 billion and an unusual provision that the bank would guarantee that the Asian nation would recoup an additional $1.4 billion from 1MDB assets seized around the world. Malaysia dropped criminal charges against the bank as part of that deal.

Goldman will seek U.S. Labor Department permission before the Malaysia unitâs December sentencing to continue handling retirement funds for Americans, its lawyers said. Banks must secure a waiver from the department to continue handling such funds after an admission of criminal conduct.

The 1MDB saga devolved into a plot to pressure the U.S. to go easy on some of the alleged looters, casting a wider web that has embroiled a prominent Republican fundraiser, an official in the Justice Department and even a former Fugees rap star.",am

355,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A former military officer and policeman who were suspected of leading a group of rebels were killed on Wednesday in a shoot out with security forces east of Burundiâs capital, the police spokesman said.

The deaths are the latest in a wave of violence gripping the poor African nation and a further sign of the armed rebellion against the government of President Pierre Nkurunziza, who sparked the crisis with his re-election for a third term.

Army Captain Idi Omar Bahenda Saidi and police Brigadier Jean Claude Niyongabo were killed in the Muramvya province of Burundi, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Bujumbura, police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye told Reuters.

Police had sought to arrest the men but they had resisted, leading to a shoot out, he said. Weapons were also seized, including an assault rifle and explosives, the spokesman said.

Opposition sources said they believed Saidi was a member of FOREBU, a rebel group which was launched in December and led by another former senior army officer, Edouard Nshimirimana.

FOREBU could not immediately be reached for comment.

Opponents of Nkurunziza accuse him of violating the constitution and a peace deal that ended the 12-year civil war in 2005 by seeking a third mandate. Loyalists cite a court ruling that said he could run.

Nkurunziza announced his bid for re-election in April and won a disputed vote in July after much of the opposition boycotted the polls.

Western powers and regional states fear that an escalation in violence could turn a crisis that has so far largely followed political allegiances into a renewed ethnic conflict.

The civil war pitted what was then an army led by the Tutsi minority against rebel groups of the Hutu majority, including one led by Nkurunziza.",nam

Kobe Steel has been indicted for allegedly violating Japan's competition law after the firm admitted it had fabricated strength and quality data of products sold to hundreds of clients.

Kobe Steel, which is Japan's third-largest steelmaker, first admitted to the wrongdoing last year.

The firm said on Thursday it was deeply sorry ""for the enormous amount of worry and trouble"" it had caused its clients.

Kobe Steel supplies makers of cars, planes and trains around the world.

Manufacturing giants including Boeing, Toyota and General Motors have been investigating whether they used any of the sub-standard materials; however, no safety issues have yet been reported.

""We once again deeply apologise for the considerable trouble we have caused to our customers, suppliers, shareholders and many others concerning the misconduct at Kobe Steel Ltd and its group companies,"" the firm said in relation to the indictment by the Tokyo District Prosecutors Office.

A report that Kobe Steel released in March said there had been a total of 688 cases of ""misconduct"" - 525 announced when the problem was first revealed in October last year, and 163 fresh cases.

It confirmed that staff had changed or made up data on the quality of some of its products before they were shipped.

Kobe Steel had ""deep-seated issues"" around corporate culture and compliance, the report admitted.

He took over as head of the mafia family after his fathers arrest and the murder of his uncle. Mariano was now leading the family in a bloody war over drug turf against the Scissionisti clan a rival Camorra faction. The turf war has claimed the lives of dozens of known mobsters from both clans in recent months. Despite his age Italian police say that Mariano was a very powerful and dangerous mobster.

Abete was found hiding in a small hidden room in his mothers house in Naples.

The designation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury generally bars U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with the six named leaders and allows their financial assets to be frozen by federal investigators, authorities said.

Known as MS-13, the gang was founded in the Pico-Union and Westlake neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran refugees who had fled a civil war raging in their country.

A 2005 investigation by The Times found that years of deportations of MS-13 leaders from California helped spread the gang across Central America and Mexico and back into more than 30 states in the U.S.

Last year, MS-13 became the first street gang designated by the Treasury Department as a transnational criminal organization. The six reputed leaders identified by federal authorities Wednesday are all Salvadoran nationals and include the suspected Central American leader of the gang.

Once called the ""King of Good Times"" due to his extravagant lifestyle, controversial Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya has been embroiled in financial scandals since 2012.

Accused of fleeing from India in 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (Â£785m), a London court has now ruled he should be extradited from the UK to India where he faces fraud charges - charges he denies.

The extradition ruling will be passed to the Home Secretary for approval. If he is sent home from the UK and found guilty, it will be a spectacular fall from grace for a man whose lifestyle brands have achieved global recognition and who has even spent time as a politician.

Mr Mallya became chairman of conglomerate United Breweries Group in 1983 aged just 28, inheriting the job when his father died.

It is best known for producing Kingfisher, India's most popular beer, but has also branched out into chemicals, paints and publishing, buying The Asian Age newspaper and Bollywood film magazine Cine Blitz.

However, the businessman's more recent ventures have courted controversy.

Kingfisher Airlines, launched in 2005, grew to become India's second largest domestic carrier, but racked up debts of more than $1bn (Â£755m) - much of which remains outstanding.

It was wound down in 2012 amid reports that pilots and cabin crew had worked unpaid for 15 months.

Mr Mallya was also forced to resign as chairman of United Spirits, India's biggest distiller, after its new owner Diageo accused him of financial wrongdoing.

Diageo is now suing the tycoon to recover payments worth $181m.

Despite the controversies Mr Mallya has maintained his trademark flamboyance and indulged his passions.

He helped co-found a Formula 1 team, Force India (although it went into administration in July when his assets were frozen), and bought Indian Premier League cricket franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for more than Â£70m.

He was even a member of the upper house of India's parliament, elected in 2002 and then again in 2010. He quit in 2016 amid allegations of wrongdoing.

Since then his creditors and regulators have been closing in.

A group of Indian banks are seeking to recover more than $1bn of loans granted to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

361,"Buenos Aires, Argentina: Assets belonging to former Argentine president Cristina Kirchner were frozen Friday after she was charged with damaging national finances by manipulating the Central Bank's exchange operations during her last months in office.

Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio said it was ""evident that the then president gave instructions -- which without a doubt were developed jointly -- to her economy minister to carry out the financial operation,"" according to a statement released on the Supreme Court's website.

Bonadio ordered assets worth 15 million pesos' ($1 million) held by Kirchner to be frozen.

He delivered the same charge and asset freeze against Axel Kicillof, Kirchner's minister of the economy from 2013 to 2015, and against former Central Bank president Alejandro Vanoli and 12 other former members of its board.

Kirchner, who held office from 2007 to 2015, is accused of having caused a loss in monetary authority through speculative dollar sales by the Central Bank at the end of 2015, just before the election of center-right President Mauricio Macri.

According to the current government, which opposed Kirchner, the operation caused a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars to Latin America's third-largest economy.

Kirchner's defenders say that the issue cannot be taken to court as it concerns disagreements over monetary policy aimed at maintaining the value of the peso.

On December 16, just six days after taking office, Macri ordered measures that led to a 34-percent devaluation of the Argentine peso, resulting in an exchange rate of one dollar per 15 pesos.

Kirchner, 63, left office in December after two consecutive terms and is no longer protected by political immunity.

The leftist former leader appeared in court in mid-April, where she refused to answer questions and instead presented a document demanding Judge Bonadio's dismissal.

Bonadio is an open critic of Kirchner, who in the past tried to have him dismissed from his post.

Kirchner has also been implicated in an embezzlement case, and along with her son, has been swept up in legal proceedings over irregularities in family real-estate activities.

Bipartisan allegations of corruption

Several former Kirchner administration officials have been tainted by allegations of corruption, but the Macri administration also faces problems.

Lazaro Baez, a wealthy entrepreneur close to the Kirchners who obtained lucrative public works contracts, is in prison while he is investigated on money laundering charges.

The Bank of China's You Huitong scheme helps people to send money overseas by transferring the cash in renminbi and then changing it.

The bank said in a statement  later deleted from its microblog account  that the service was part of a pilot programme in line with government policy, for people applying for immigrant investor schemes or buying property overseas.

""In the operation of this service, the Bank of China has followed relevant regulations and anti-laundering requirements and established very strict operating procedures.

""The procedures set unified and clear standards requiring proofs of the uses and sources of the money. The mentions of 'underground finance' and 'money laundering' in the reports are not based in fact."" It also noted that several commercial banks were trialling similar services in Guangdong.

Steve Tsang, head of the school of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham, said it was very unusual to see such aggressive reporting on a major state-owned enterprise (SOE) in state media.

""It is something which reflects on decisions at a very senior level,"" he said. ""I would be surprised if whoever is in charge at CCTV would have done a report like this without clearing it with the propaganda department, who would therefore have cleared it with someone even more senior.""

Making allegations of that kind against such a high-profile SOE could be seen as causing significant reputational damage to China as a whole, he noted. Even if journalists believed they had reliable sources, he said, ""if it's politically unacceptable to the leadership, you don't run it"".",am
363,"The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists leaked to the public millions of documents held at the offshore law firm Appleby, which included information related to former energy minister and current head of the Kazakh national oil and gas company, Sauat Mynbayev.

The so-called Paradise Papers show that Mynbayev was a shareholder in Meridian Capital Ltd. since its incorporation in Bermuda in 2002. Since then, an article on Eurasianet shows, Mynbayevs career and Meridians fortunes seemed to improve at a similar pace. In 2005, according to documents of the 2015 Swiss Leak, Meridian was estimated to be worth around $1.2 billion. The following year, its assets had grown to $3 billion. Mynbayev in the meantime had been appointed to the post of deputy prime minister first, and then promoted to head the Samruk-Kazyna sovereign wealth fund. After another sudden career jump, in 2007 he was put at the highest ministerial post dealing with energy issues. Since 2013, Mynbayev has served as the chairman of the national oil and gas company Kazmunaigas.

Immediately after the leak, government sources and Kazmunaigas dismissed the claims. Only a few days after, Mynbayev finally confirmed that he had been a shareholder for several years. His share amounted to 18.75 percent in 2006, but could have been even higher in previous years. Mynbayev also added that he never concealed his ownership of Meridian in his tax returns and that he had left the company a few years ago. In retrospect, distant ties between Meridian and Mynbayev had already been exposed two years ago in a local investigative outlet.

The other owners all shared a similar background: they were all managers or shareholders in one of Kazakhstans largest banks, Kazkommertsbank. Mynbayev himself had been a deputy chairman of Kazkommertsbank in 1993-1995. After some restructuring and rebranding, Kazkommertsbank, now Qazkom, has become part of Halyk Bank, owned by president Nursultan Nazarbayevs daughter and her husband.

Mynbayev and some of his Meridian associates were also linked to another offshore scheme, concerning the ownership of TengizTransGaz, the largest private fleet of oil and gas rail cargo. TengizTransGaz is owned by Dutch company TTG Group, in turn owned by another Dutch company, whose mother company is based in Cyprus. Journalists at the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project were unable to trace the ultimate owner of the company. Owning this additional segment of the oil industry would have given Mynbayev a clear vantage point against any competitor. TengizTransGazs main customer was the consortium operating the Tengiz oilfield, for decades the largest producer in Kazakhstan.

Unlike several other figures controlling the oil sector in Kazakhstan, Mynbayev originates from Taldykorgan, near Almaty, thousands of miles away from the rich oil fields around the Caspian Sea. His profile was closer to the financial elites and became closely linked to a rampant figure in Kazakhstans oil sector, according to Maurizio Totaro, PhD Fellow at University of Ghent, whose work focuses on the Kazakhstani oil region of Mangystau.

Mynbayev is not from western Kazakhstan, but the director of Meridian Petroleum [one of Meridian Capitals subsidiaries], Baltabek Kuandykov, is from Makat, in the Atyrau oblast. Kuandykov is not only a geologist by training, but has been very much involved in the government in the first half of the 1990s. With his knowledge, both technical and political, Kuandykov could have been one of the anchors of Meridian to the oil regions, Totaro told The Diplomat.

Despite a potential conflict of interests, the partnership between Meridian and Kazkommertsbank thrived in the first decade of this century. Meridian and its two Cayman Island-registered subsidiaries took out loans from Kazkommertsbank to implement their diversified business portfolio, which ranged from oil and gas to real estate. Below Meridian Capital CIS Fund and Meridian Capital International Fund were a vast range of companies whose ownership structure looked like a typical offshore Russian doll network.

One of Meridians most famous exploits was the sale of the Galereya shopping mall in St. Petersburg to financial giant Morgan Stanley in 2012 for $1.1 billion. The leaked documents show that the company owns businesses in Kazakhstan and around the world, but the name Meridian is nowhere to be found in shareholding declarations.

Importantly, Mynbayev had always been regarded as an irreprehensible and loyal public servant, one of those trustworthy figures that Nazarbayev would turn to when a government reshuffle was warranted.

In the meantime, however, Mynbayev was conducting business while holding public office, without declaring a potential conflict of interest. According to the leaked documents, Mynbayevs co-venturers would have behaved in violation of Kazakhstans law, in force between 2005 and 2011, banning bank shareholders from owning offshore assets. The legislation was put in place to counter potential capital flight, with banks lending out to offshore companies that would, in turn, not be accountable for non-payments. And this is precisely what happened.

The financialization of the oil sector, in particular, created a scheme all too familiar to observers of Kazakhstans trade flows.

Tax havens are one of the crucial nodes of the financialization of the oil trade. For instance, in 2015, roughly 15 percent of the crude oil exported from Mangystau, worth around $1 billion, was destined to Bermuda. It is quite unrealistic to assume that the crude was physically delivered to the Caribbean. The same can be said for Mangystaus largest importer, Switzerland (57 percent), where some of the largest companies trading oil futures are based, Totaro said.

Mynbayev, together with many others in the industry, could have benefited from the agile and obscure practice of selling oil through offshore entities. His position of privilege, within the highest echelons of the energy sector, however, could have given him and his associates an unfair advantage.",nam
364,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has revoked the capital markets services licence of Apical Asset Management (AAMPL) on Tuesday (Jul 28).

The revocation of the company's license is due to ""serious breaches of MAS' anti-money laundering/countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements"", according to the authority's media release.

For a company to conduct financial activities under the Securities and Futures Act, it has to hold a capital markets services (CMS) licence.

'SEVERE DEFICIENCIES'

The MAS said it uncovered ""severe deficiencies"" in the companys AML/CFT controls from 2013 to 2018. The financial institution did not have the relevant basic policies and procedures in place which exposed it to the ""risk of receiving and/or laundering the proceeds of crime"".

This risk was heightened with complex ownership structures, comprising multiple layers and investment entities used by some of the AAMPL's customers.

The MAS stated four breaches made by the company.

AAMPL did not conduct any enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is crucial to allow an entity to better understand its overall vulnerability to money laundering and terrorist financing risks. This assessment, which is conducted at least once every two years or when there are material trigger events, helps a company develop appropriate measures to address such risks.

The company did not properly assess its customers to determine whether they presented higher money laundering or terrorism financing risks.

AAMPL's ongoing monitoring controls and procedures were also found by MAS to be deficient, ""resulting in its failure to conduct enhanced monitoring of a fund related to a politically exposed person for a significant length of time"".

Lastly, AAMPL did not subject its AML/CFT controls to independent audits to assess their effectiveness.

CEO AND DIRECTOR REPRIMANDED

The MAS also reprimanded AAMPL's CEO and director Yeh Yin Yee and director Bernard Kan Cheok Yin for failing to discharge their duties and functions to ensure that the company complies with all laws and rules governing its operations.

Both Mr Yeh and Mr Kan were the only directors on AAMPL's board and were responsible for the management of its affairs, said the MAS.

The authority noted that the men have ""failed to exercise sufficient oversight or take reasonable steps"" to ensure the company put in place controls to detect and deter the flow of illicit funds through the financial system.

""MAS will not hesitate to take appropriate action against financial institutions whose policies and controls clearly fail to address the money laundering/terrorism financing risks in their business activities. Board and senior management who fall short in their duties will also be taken to task, said Ms Loo Siew Yee, assistant managing director for policy, payments and financial crime at MAS.",am
365,"A Chinese national whose Instagram page features pictures of him wearing a VIP pass at a 2018 rally for President Donald Trump, is now on U.S. soil after being charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine and laundering the illicit funds, according to court documents filed earlier this week.

Tao Liu, whose alias is Antony Liu, is in the custody of the Alexandria (Virginia) Sheriffs Office, where he will be held pending his initial appearance likely sometime next week.

Liu is one of six Chinese nationals charged in a conspiracy that allegedly netted at least $30 million from 2008 to late last month and involved funneling illicit drug money to Latin American traffickers, the indictment says.

Federal prosecutors allege that the men, in part, laundered their drug proceeds by purchasing products in the U.S. and shipping them to China. The products were then sold through black market merchants in China, the indictment says, with the money sent back to drug traffickers in Latin America, often Mexicans, through Chinese currency.

The effort, the indictment says, required special care and skill in money laundering.

Liu was also charged with trying to bribe two men, who turned out to be undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents, in order to get fraudulent passports.

An Instagram page belonging to Liu features several photos of him at a September 2018 Trump rally in Wheeler, W.Va.

The Instagram page includes numerous photos from the rally as well as an image of a red USA hat with a signature that appears to be the presidents.

Thanks for the gift from Mr. President Trump, reads a post that accompanies the photo.

NBC News found no records indicating that Liu donated to the Trump campaign and it would be illegal for Liu, as a foreign national, to donate money to a political campaign.

Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment.

Liu, who was taken into custody in Alexandria, Va., could not be reached. It was not immediately clear if he had hired a lawyer.

The other five men were identified in court documents as Xizhi Li, Jianxing Chen, Jingyan Li, Eric Yong Woo, Jiayu Chen. The men were all born in China but now reside in New York, California and several Latin American countries, according to the indictment.

Federal prosecutors allege that Xizhi Li, who went by the aliases Juan Lee and had a WeChat name of JL 007 and SUPERKING 99, developed close ties with drug traffickers and cartels in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, and elsewhere to obtain contracts to move drug proceeds for the dealers.

The other five men are accused of working with Xizhi Li to help launder the drug money in a scheme that began in 2008 and lasted up until late last month, the indictment says.

Xizhi Li allegedly had bank accounts with BBVA Compass in Miami, Florida, which he used as part of the conspiracy.

In a 2019 DEA seizure application for BBVA accounts in Tennessee, investigators told the court that in the course of investigating a local drug gang they determined that the cocaine in the greater Memphis area was being supplied by the Sinaola cartel and the money laundering efforts for those transactions were allegedly directed by Xizhi Li.

BBVA Compass declined to comment.

The indictment also says Xizhi Li owned and operated a casino in Guatemala City, Guatemala, which he used to launder money and provided him a place to meet drug traffickers.

Liu is accused of trying to fraudulently obtain passports for multiple people in April. He allegedly struck a deal with undercover agents who told him they knew someone at the State Department who could illegally provide passports at a cost of $150,000 each.

The indictment says that Liu agreed to deposit about $5,000 in cryptocurrency and $5,000 in cash into what turned out to be a DEA-controlled account in order to start the process of getting the passports.

Liu was also hit with a separate money laundering charge for allegedly moving some of the funds for the bribes through cryptocurrency.

He attended several events in New York City and the surrounding area with Trump associate Joe Cinque, according to press reports and social media posts. Cinque presented him with an award when Liu held a kickoff for his investment company called Blue Water Capital. Little about Blue Water Capital, purportedly located at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, is known publicly.

A website for the firm is now defunct. There is no listing at 1 Rockefeller Plaza for Lius company and at least one firm that Liu touted as a business connection in a company video says theyve never heard of the man.",am
366,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in trouble yet again for trying to get a free ride. It recently came out that back in June, he had requested a government plane to take his wife on their honeymoon in Europe, with the lame justification that he needed secure communications. This was counter to standard government practice  as a former White House ethics counsel explains, you don't need a private plane to have a secure phone or internet connection  and Mnuchin didn't get the request approved.

Still, it's both a blackly amusing story, and a window into an administration that is absolutely suffused with penny-ante corruption. If there's anything that characterizes basic government operation under President Trump, it is constant grifting.

This is something of a pattern for the secretary. Before this latest revelation, Mnuchin got in trouble for the exact same reason, when he took his wife Louise Linton on a government plane to Fort Knox, Kentucky, during the solar eclipse. Linton posted a shockingly gauche picture of the trip on Instagram, showing her and Mnuchin descending from a government plane, carefully noting the names of all the hyper-expensive designer clothing she was wearing with hashtags (#valentino).

Then when someone commented about the taxpayer expense, Linton came unglued in typical elitist fashion, as Jia Tolentino notes:

In a few aggrieved sentences, Linton managed to frame her husbands $300 million net worth as a burden, her six months in Washington as harrowing public servitude, and an ordinary American as a contemptible member of the economic underclass. She punctuated this bit with two emoji, a flexed bicep, and a kissy face, which were meant to convey nonchalance but instead communicated a type of strained, hierarchical female fury that I have not witnessed in person since cheerleading camp, in 2005. [ The New Yorker ]

Then on Thursday last week, Mnuchin dug himself in even deeper. At a Politico conference, he managed to strain credulity to the breaking point while also scoffing that only stupid country rubes (e.g. Trump voters) could care about an eclipse anyway. ""Being a New Yorker and [also from] California, I was like, the eclipse? Really?"" he said. ""I don't have any interest in watching the eclipse."" Yeah, sure Steve. It was merest coincidence that you took your wife to within a few dozen miles of the eclipse totality zone during the 45 minutes that it passed by.

All these episodes make for a combination of deeply irritating rich New Yorker elitism and Mobutu-esque abuse of the public fisc. Somewhat by coincidence, Linton is also notorious for publishing a ""memoir"" about a gap year in Zambia, where she supposedly had dangerous encounters with rebels fighting the Second Congo War. Locals  as well as anyone who had been to Zambia at the time  immediately pointed out that many of the lurid details were obviously invented (and full of disgusting racist stereotypes to boot). They pulled the book, and it cannot now be purchased on Amazon.

However, all this is just the tip of the iceberg for the Trump administration. Since Trump took office, there have been a constant trickle of stories of him abusing his position as president to enrich himself, his family, and his businesses  from his daughter getting patents from China on the same day he met with the Chinese president, to charging the Secret Service to use his golf carts or an obscene rent in Trump Tower, to a revelation on Friday that the government had paid $1,092 for officials in the National Security Council to stay at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.

Corruption is even being given official sanction. Last week it came out that the Office of Government Ethics (whose chief resigned in protest in July, saying the U.S. has become ""close to a laughingstock"" on ethics) will allow legal defense funds for aides caught up in the Russia investigation to accept anonymous donations from lobbyists.

Trump could probably just write himself a billion-dollar check from the Treasury (or perhaps print a billion-dollar platinum coin, with his face on it of course), but that appears to be beyond his imagination. Instead, it's going to be an endless parade of this kind of relatively small-bore looting. That is almost certainly why Mnuchin feels comfortable asking for a $25,000-per-hour perk. If everyone else has their hands in the till, why not him?",am
367,"A special CBI court on Thursday sentenced B Ramalinga Raju, his two brothers and seven others to seven years in prison in the Satyam fraud case.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 5 crore on Ramalinga Raju, the Satyam Computer Services Ltd's founder and former chairman, and his brother B Rama Raju and Rs 20-25 lakh each on the remaining accused.

HT presents a lowdown of the country's biggest-ever corporate accounting scandal.
What is the Satyam scam about?

It is about corporate governance and fraudulent auditing practices allegedly in connivance with auditors and chartered accountants. The company misrepresented its accounts both to its board, stock exchanges, regulators, investors and all other stakeholders.
Is this an accounting fraud, a market manipulation/fraud or both?

It is a fraud, which misled the market and other stakeholders by lying about the companys financial health. Even basic facts such as revenues, operating profits, interest liabilities and cash balances were grossly inflated to show the company in good health.
Who is to blame here? The promoters?

The promoters are primary culprits, although it is almost impossible to misrepresent such facts without the connivance of the auditors and some executive board members. Independent directors, it seems, were kept in the dark about the actual books of accounts.
What about the auditors?

The role of external third party auditors, who were tasked to ensure that no financial bungling is undertaken to carry out promoters interest or hide facts, have also been brought to question.

Anatomy of a fraud

1. Maintaining records
· Raju maintained thorough details of the Satyam's accounts and minutes of meetings since 2002.

· Raju stored records of accounts for the latest year (2008-09) in a computer server called ""My Home Hub.""

2. Fake invoices and bills
· Details of accounts from 2002 till January 7, 2009  the day Raju came out with his dramatic, five-page confession - were stored in two separate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
· Fake invoices and bills were created using software applications such as 'Ontime' that was used for calculating hours put in by an employee
· A secret programme was allegedly planted in the source code of the official invoice management system creating a user id 'Super User' with the power to hide or show the invoices in the system.

3. Web of companies
· A web of 356 investment companies was used to allegedly divert funds from Satyam.
· These companies had several transactions in the form of inter-corporate investments, advances and loans within and among them.
· One such company, with a paid up capital of Rs 5 lakh, had made an investment of Rs 90.25 crore and received unsecured loans of Rs 600 crore.

4. Why did he need the money

· The cash so raised was used to purchase several thousands of acres of land across Andhra Pradesh to ride a booming realty market.

· It presented a growing problem as facts had to be doctored to keep showing healthy profits for Satyam that was growing in size and scale.

· Every attempt made to eliminate the gap failed.

· As Raju put it, ""it was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.""

· Cashing out by selling Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties to Satyam for an estimated Rs 7,800 crore was the last straw. The attempt failed and Raju made the stunning confessions three weeks later.",am
368,"May 28, 2013 -- Internet bank Liberty Reserve is being charged with laundering $6 billion in suspected crime proceeds, including the illegal profits from credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking.

Prosecutors say it ""may be the largest international money laundering case ever brought by the United States.""

Liberty Reserve was a ""black market bank,"" created and structured to ""facilitate criminal activity,"" according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Bharara and top officials from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network unsealed an indictment against Liberty Reserve and seven of its principals today, charging them with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Liberty Reserve is estimated to have had more than 1 million users worldwide, including more than 200,000 users in the United States.

All told, the government charges, Liberty Reserve processed 55 million separate financial transactions and laundered $6 billion in criminal proceeds. According to the indictment, Liberty Reserve operated a digital currency system designed to provide criminals with a way to launder their profits without leaving a trace.

""As alleged, Liberty Reserve deliberately operated in a way to attract and aid criminals who wished to use digital currency to break the law and to launder the proceeds of their crimes,"" Bharara said. ""We have indicted Liberty Reserve itself because, as alleged, its entire existence was based on a criminal business model.""

In addition to indicting the company and its principals, the government is restraining more than $25 million in alleged criminal proceeds from the company, forfeiting its domain names, and seizing its servers around the world.

The investigation and takedown involved law enforcement action in 17 countries, including Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Spain, Morocco, Sweden, Switzerland, Cyprus, Australia, China, Norway, Latvia, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada and the U.S.

The government charges that Liberty Reserve was so intent on attracting criminal customers, it didn't even bother to ask its clients for basic identifying information, or to validate their identities, all in the interest of keeping transactions untraceable.

Users routinely established accounts under false names, including such blatantly criminal names as ""Russia Hackers"" and ""Hacker Account,"" according to the indictment.

As part of the investigation, the indictment says, a law enforcement agent opened and executed transactions through an undercover account at Liberty Reserve in the name of ""Joe Bogus"" and the address ""123 Fake Main Street"" in ""Completely Made Up City, New York.""

The government also charges that Liberty Reserve, based in Costa Rica, tried a number of dodges to stay in business, even after the governments of the U.S. and Costa Rica tried to shut them down.

The defendants were allegedly caught lying to anti-money laundering authorities in Costa Rica and pretending to shut down Liberty Reserve after learning the company was being investigated by U.S. law enforcement. They then allegedly continued operating the business through a set of shell companies, and moved tens of millions of dollars through shell company accounts maintained in Cyprus, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Morocco, Spain, Australia and elsewhere.

Liberty Reserve today was also named a ""financial institution of primary money laundering concern"" under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This Treasury Department action includes a notice to the Federal Register proposing to prohibit U.S. banks and financial institutions from opening or maintaining accounts for foreign banks that are being used to process transactions involving Liberty Reserve.

Five defendants were arrested on May 24, 2013, including Arthur Budovsky, the principal founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Spain; Vladmir Kats, the co-founder of Liberty Reserve, who was arrested in Brooklyn, N.Y.; Azzeddine El Amine, a manager of Liberty Reserve's financial accounts, who was arrested in Spain; and Mark Marmilev and Maxim Chukharev, who helped design and maintain Liberty Reserve's technological infrastructure, who were arrested in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, respectively.

Two other defendants, Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani (Yassine) and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez (Hidalgo), are at large in Costa Rica.

ABC News' efforts to reach a representative of Liberty Reserve were unsuccessful.

""The global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking."" Bharara said. ""As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth.""",am
369,"Notorious warlord and world-renowned terrorist Gulbuddin Hikmatyar announced his candidacy for the Afghan presidential election on Saturday, presenting President Ghani with yet another challenge upon his return from his Taliban-imposed exile after twenty years. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar led a faction of the mujahedeen against the Russians during the invasion of the 1990s, and until 2016, he remained isolated from Afghan politics.

Hikmatyar announced his decision amidst pledges to restore stability and peace and accused the Ghani-led government of failing to reign in the Taliban. At a news conference held in Kabul, Hekmatyar said, Our countrys situation requires a powerful central government led by an elected president supported by the majority of people.

This sudden decision is undoubtedly a grave challenge for the already cornered Ghani, and analysts regard it as the warlords ploy to politically validate his party, the Hizb-i-Islami.

The Afghan President granted Hikmatyar immunity in 2016 after signing a peace deal; a decision that Washington also accepted. However, Hekmatyar continues to criticize the governance of Ghani, along with the legitimacy of the parliamentary election process back in October. While President Ghani has set his ambitions on a second term, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is not the only challenger to the throne.

On Friday, Mohammad Hanif Atmar former National Directorate of Security (NDS) adviser who bid goodbye to the government back in August has emerged as the most powerful challenger to Ghani. Atmar has pledged to save the country from the maladministration of the Ghani-led government.

Atmar is an addition to the list of names who have formally joined the presidential race, including former chief of intelligence, Rahmatullah Nabil. Zalmai Rassoul, the former foreign minister, who emerged third in the controversial elections of 2014, has also announced his decision to join the race. Lastly, Shaida Abdali, a former diplomatic aide to former President Hamid Karzai, will also be competing in the election.

Given the deadlock that has emerged in the negotiations between the Taliban and the US diplomatic mission, analysts are entertaining the possibility of a delay in the election. Experts have also noted that the peace negotiations might end up in a settlement that allows the Taliban a role of governance in the future.

The Afghan elections scheduled for July this year are circled with challenges, as Taliban control major areas of the country, security is the greatest concern. Moreover, the challenges and public at large are afraid that fraudulence will undermine the sanctity of the vote, as the 2014 election was widely accused of being mismanaged and heavily rigged.

372,"As Venezuelas oil-based economy continues to crumble, a politically connected class of businessmen with financial ties to Miami has grown fabulously wealthy from energy deals with the socialist government. Among the Venezuelan upper crust who have made fortunes during the Bolivarian revolution: Alejandro Betancourt.

Without any experience in the energy industry, Betancourt co-founded a power company called Derwick Associates a decade ago that has reaped billions of dollars in government contracts for a string of new plants in Venezuela  drawing barbs about being overpaid for the projects and having cozy relationships with top politicians.

With his windfall, Betancourt not only expanded his business into the United States but also bought a penthouse apartment in Manhattans Olympic Tower, along with a castle estate and other luxury properties in Spain, according to court documents.

In Miami, Betancourt has surfaced in a massive money laundering case that charges his cousin and several of the so-called Boliburgueses  young , well-educated entrepreneurs close to the Venezuelan regime  with conspiring to bribe government officials to approve a loan scheme to embezzle $1.2 billion from the countrys national oil company during the presidency of Nicolas Maduro.

Although Betancourt is not identified by name in the federal case filed in Miami, several sources familiar with the widening investigation say that he is Conspirator 2 among the dozen unnamed Venezuelan conspirators and officials listed in a criminal complaint that details the alleged international racket.

Betancourt, 39, and some of the other unidentified conspirators and officials could be added as defendants to an indictment, according to sources familiar with the federal case. So far, nine defendants have been charged in the Miami case, with two pleading guilty and one awaiting trial. The remaining six defendants, including Betancourts cousin, Francisco Convit Guruceaga, are considered fugitives by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Miami.

Betancourts attorney, prominent Miami lawyer Jon Sale, issued a statement Friday denying his involvement. My client denies any wrongdoing, Sale said.

In Miami, Houston and New York, several corruption cases have been pursued by the Justice Department alleging bribery, embezzlement and money laundering activities in Venezuela and the United States that have taken a devastating toll on Venezuelas economy. The country has suffered the loss of billions of dollars embezzled from its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A, or PDVSA, mainly because of green-palming between government officials and the countrys elite business class, federal authorities say.

Russell Dallen, a lawyer and investment manager, spoke about foreign corruption at the Latin America Summit on Friday in Miami, spotlighting the prosecution of the PDVSA money-laundering case and others. Dallen, head of Caracas Capital in Miami, said Venezuelas rampant corruption has caused dramatic declines in oil production and income over the past two decades, fueling hyperinflation, widespread poverty and the exodus of more than four million people.

Instead of reinvesting the money and rebuilding the country, it was all stolen through these currency-exchange and loan schemes, said Dallen, pointing out that Venezuela was once among the biggest oil producers in the world.

The Venezuelan people are starving, he added. The [minimum wage] is $5 a month, up from $2. Thats all they make  its less than Haiti, less than Cuba. Thats why people are voting with their feet and leaving the country.

In the Miami case, federal court records say that Conspirator 2 was among the ring of Boliburgueses and government officials who received hundreds of million of dollars in late 2014 from PDVSA as payment for a loan that they made to the state-owned oil company. A criminal affidavit alleges the ring used a shell company to loan $42 million worth of bolivars and then got repaid in euros at the governments favorable exchange rate. That currency exchange transaction instantly multiplied the loan repayment to the equivalent of $600 million.

Betancourts cousin, Convit, who also sits on the board of directors of Derwicks Oil and Gas Corp., is the lead defendant mentioned with Conspirator 2 in the introduction to the complaint affidavit.

Betancourts chief financial officer at Derwick, Orlando Alvarado, is listed as Conspirator 4 in the Miami case and also as an associate of his cousin, Convit. According to the affidavit, Conspirator 4 discussed a plan in 2016 with one of the rings leaders to create fake foreign currency exchange contracts to make the embezzlement of the national oil companys funds look legitimate so the proceeds could be transferred to Convit and several others, including Conspirator 2 and Venezuelan officials accused of accepting bribes.

Conspirator 4 [Alvarado] suggested a meeting with everyone who has an interest to sort things out and fix the papers before things get bad when it is too late, the affidavit says.

The close relationship between Convit, Betancourt and Alvarado raises questions about what Betancourt knew of the alleged loan scheme at Venezuelas state-owned oil company and the flow of laundered money. The detailed affidavit, however, does not provide evidence of Betancourts knowledge of the illicit PDVSA loan scheme. Nor does it provide proof, such as a bank record or wire transfer, showing he was aware of the source of the laundered money he allegedly received.

According to the affidavit filed in July of last year, PDVSA repaid the rings loan to a shell company called Rantor Capital, transferring the $600 million to Portmann Capital Management in Malta. The oil companys loan repayment was eventually turned over to another shell company, Eaton Global Services Limited, set up in Hong Kong, which was controlled by the Venezuelan leaders of the money-laundering conspiracy, federal prosecutors say.

The $600 million windfall was then divided up among the group of wealthy Venezuelan businessmen, the three stepsons of Maduro and PDVSA officials, according to an email obtained by agents with Homeland Security Investigations and sources familiar with the criminal case. The president and his stepsons  Yosser Gavídia Flores, Walter Gavídia Flores and Yoswal Gavídia Flores  are under investigation in the Miami case, sources said.

According to the affidavit, here is how the government funds were distributed in in late 2014 and early 2015:

? $272.5 million went to Raul Gorrín, the Venezuelan tycoon who owns a Caracas TV network, insurance company and other businesses. He has not been charged in the Miami case, but is considered a main suspect in the federal investigation. In turn, Gorrín kept about $72.5 million for himself  wiring some money to pay for aviation, yacht and brokerage services in Miami  and gave the balance, $200 million, to Portmann Capital Management for the benefit of Maduros three grown stepsons from his marriage to Cilia Flores.

? That account was set up for the stepsons in the name of a straw representative, Mario Enrique Bonilla Vallera, a Venezuelan businessman who owns a handful of Florida companies with addresses linked to four multimillion-dollar homes in the exclusive Cocoplum neighborhood of Coral Gables. Bonilla has been charged in the money-laundering indictment, but remains at large.

? $272.5 million also went to Convit and Conspirator 2. Of that total, $94 million was distributed to Pedro Binaggia, an attorney and businessman who was tasked to launder millions of dollars from Venezuela to Europe and the United States. (In 2016, Binaggia became a confidential source for Homeland Security Investigations out of fear that he would get caught laundering funds.)

? Binaggia redistributed about $20 million to: Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, former legal counsel for the Venezuelan Ministry of Oil and Mining; Abraham Edgardo Ortega, a former director of finance at PDVSA; Jose Vicente Amparan Croquer, described as a professional money launderer, and three other unnamed Venezuelan conspirators with ties to the state-owned oil company.

Those three are Victor Eduardo Aular Blanco, a former PDVSA vice president of finance who authorized the state-owned oil companys loan with the ring; Alvaro Ledo Nass, a former PDVSA general counsel, and his lawyer-brother, Adolfo Ledo Nass, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

The remaining funds were absorbed by the cost of the initial loan to the oil company and Portmann Capitals charges related to the transaction.

Significantly, some of Venezuelas embezzled money was funneled through shell companies into fabricated investment funds, U.S. banks and South Florida luxury real estate, forming the foundation for the federal money-laundering case in Miami. Gorrin, who was close to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as well as Maduro, invested tens of millions of dollars in Cocoplum and in luxury condominiums in Miami and Manhattan.

The news media in Venezuela and the United States have focused on Gorrin because of his high profile in business and political circles. Although he has not been charged in the Maduro-era money laundering case, Gorrin has been indicted in a similar $1 billion bribery and embezzlement scheme involving the former Venezuelan treasurer, Alejandro Andrade, in the Chavez administration. Andrade, who cooperated with federal authorities, has already pleaded and begun a 10-year prison sentence..

Betancourt, though less well known, exerts tremendous influence in Venezuela as well. A graduate of Suffolk University in Boston, Betancourt founded Derwick a decade ago with Pedro Trebbau Lopez, the energy companys vice president. (Trebbau has not been implicated in the ongoing Venezuelan kleptocracy case in Miami.) Betancourt and Trebbau made immediate inroads with the Chavez administration as it looked for private partners in the oil and energy industries.

Ever since, Derwick has been surrounded by controversy. At times, the company has been accused of corruption for obtaining huge energy construction contracts from the Venezuelan government without having the required know-how. The company has also been accused of overcharging for the installation of used and inadequate equipment.

According to a 128-page report on the energy sector written by ONG Transparencia Venezuela, the local chapter of Transparency International, Derwick was awarded 11 construction contracts worth $5 billion. But the government contracts were overbilled by $2.9 billion, an average increase of 162 percent, the report says.

José Aguilar, an engineer who was tasked with investigating Derwick for the Wall Street Journal, said the company records he reviewed suggests that it charged the Venezuelan government between $2 billion and $2.2 billion for the 11 projects  work that could have been done for between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.

There was at least $800 million in overbilling, Aguilar told el Nuevo Herald, noting the company hired inexpensive contractors to do much of its work.

But a study written by a professor at the Simon Bolivar University in Caracas commended Derwicks work, saying it was one of the few government energy contractors that actually completed their plants within budgets.

But not all of Derwicks plants came online, and at least one never produced electricity, Aguilar said. The output of all these plants has been traditionally poor, he said.

Derwicks rapid rise led to confrontations with a leading financial institution, Banco Venezolano de Credito, which adopted an anti-Chavez stand and accused the energy company of being in league with the president. The rivals accusations sparked defamation lawsuits, with Derwick firing the first salvo with a libel suit in Miami.

Then, Otto J. Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela and diplomat in three Republican administrations, was hired by the Venezuelan bank to take on Derwick in a public relations war. Reich himself ended up suing Betancourt and other Derwick officials in a libel case filed in New York federal court, accusing them of paying bribes to Venezuelan government officials. Reichs suit against Betancourt, Derwicks CEO, and its vice president, Trebbau, was dismissed. After the dismissal, Reich reached a confidential settlement with a third defendant in 2016.

Derwicks Betancourt and Alvarado have been collaborating on energy- and oil-related business deals for years.

Betancourt and Alvarado made headlines in 2015, when they became major shareholders in a Panama-based company called OHara that sought to take control of a Canadian oil company, Pacific Rubiales, which ran some of Colombias largest oil fields.

According to press reports, OHara joined with other investors to acquire about 20 percent of Pacific Rubialess shares, establishing the group as the companys largest shareholders. But Betancourts investment push  along with his becoming a member of Pacific Rubiales board  led to strained relations with the companys original shareholders.

Facing imminent bankruptcy amid falling oil prices, the Canadian oil company was sold to another investment group in an emergency transaction  but Betancourt, Alvarado and other investors lost millions in the end.

Betancourt and Alvarado continue to face potential trouble as they come under scrutiny in the Miami money-laundering case. It is moving along, despite the absence of six defendants who are at large in Venezuela and possibly elsewhere.

Matthias Krull, an international banker who catered to mega-rich Venezuelans including Gorrin, pleaded guilty soon after his arrest in July of last year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Krull admitted that he was retained by Gorrin to help launder some of the Venezuelan rings $600 million from Europe to the United States in 2016, including efforts to move $200 million through straw representatives for Maduros three stepsons..

But Krull has been allowed to remain free on a bond in Miami because of the value of his cooperation with the U.S. Attorneys Office, according to his lawyer, Oscar S. Rodriguez.

Krull, the German-born son of a Lutheran pastor who was raised in Venezuela and educated in Switzerland, was based in Panama as a banker for the Swiss bank Julius Baer before his arrest. According to court records, he has helped investigators understand the complex web of relationships between the defendants and other suspects in the huge money laundering case.

Mr. Krulls value actually comes from the fact that he has been a banker in Venezuela ... for a long time, prosecutor Michael Nadler said in September while alerting a federal judge that he would be recommending a sentence reduction for Krull when he surrenders in March. The amount of people that he has put us in contact with ... is large.

Abraham Edgardo Ortega, a former executive director of financial planning at PDVSA, also pleaded guilty a year ago to accepting millions of dollars in bribes that were secretly wired to U.S. and other financial institutions with the assistance of a Miami investment manager and others.

Ortega, who worked at PDVSA for more than a decade, admitted he used his official role to give priority status to Venezuelan companies that did business with the government so they could tap into its vast oil income to make overnight fortunes through loan and currency exchange schemes. He has been free on bond while cooperating with authorities and still awaits sentencing.

In February, Miami investment manager Gustavo Hernandez Frieri faces trial on charges of helping launder at least $12 million in bribery payments to Ortega. Hernandezs alleged role was to put that money into a fake mutual fund so that it looked legitimate and then launder it into U.S. banks for a fee.

Hernandez, who lives in the exclusive Bay Point neighborhood of Miami and ran his business from a Brickell Avenue office, remains free on bond. Nadler, the prosecutor, indicated in court that Hernandez may not go to trial because he and his attorney Michael Pasano, are in discussions about pleas and that the terms are still being worked out.",am
373,"(CNN) New York federal prosecutors on Thursday charged President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon and three others with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump's border wall.

Bannon, 66, was arrested at 7:30 a.m. Thursday near Westbrook, Connecticut, on the yacht of exiled Chinese dissident Guo Wengui, according to two law enforcement officials. Federal agents, officials from the United States Postal Inspection Service and the United States Coast Guard, assisted, officials said.

During an initial court appearance in New York later Thursday, Bannon pleaded not guilty and was set to be released on bail including a $5 million bond to be secured by $1.75 million in cash or real property. As part of his bail conditions, he will be prohibited from travel on private airplanes, yachts or boats without permission from the court.

Appearing via video conference, Bannon sported a white face mask, a button-down shirt and a sunburn.

As he exited the federal courthouse, Bannon removed his mask and waved at supporters before confronting a group of reporters.

""This entire fiasco is to stop people who want to build the wall,"" Bannon said.

The four men were indicted for allegedly using hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to an online crowdfunding campaign called We Build the Wall for personal expenses, among other things. Bannon and another defendant, Brian Kolfage, promised donors that the campaign, which ultimately raised more than $25 million, was ""a volunteer organization"" and that ""100% of the funds raised...will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose,"" according to the indictment unsealed Thursday.

But instead, according to prosecutors, Bannon, through a non-profit under his control, used more than $1 million from We Build the Wall to ""secretly"" pay Kolfage and cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses.

Kolfage, according to the charges, spent more than $350,000 of the donations on personal expenses, including cosmetic surgery, a luxury SUV, a golf cart, payments toward a boat, home renovations, jewelry, personal tax payments and credit card debt.

Bannon, Kolfage and the other two defendants, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea, are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Kolfage, Badolato and Shea didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.

""As alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,"" Acting Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement. ""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle.""

The indictment describes a sleight-of-hand perpetrated by the defendants on donors to the We Build the Wall group. Within days of launching the group, Kolfage, along with Bannon and Badolato, made a ""secret agreement"" in which Kolfage would be paid ""$100k upfront [and] then 20 [per] month,"" according to the indictment. To disguise the transfer of the money to Kolfage, Bannon agreed to pass the payments through the non-profit he controlled, according to prosecutors, and in February 2019, Bannon and Badolato directed the non-profit to pay Kolfage $100,000 from We Build the Wall.

Trump: 'I feel very badly'

Speaking at the White House in the hours after Bannon's arrest, Trump said he felt ""very badly.""

""Well I feel very badly. I haven't been dealing with him for a long period of time,"" Trump said, noting that he was ""involved in our campaign"" and ""for a small part of the administration very early on."" Bannon served in the Trump administration from the inauguration through August 2017.

As for the border wall fundraising project, Trump claimed he knew ""nothing"" about it and did not know the people involved with it, even though other key allies are on its board.

""I know nothing about the project other than I didn't like when I read about it. I didn't like it. I said this is for government, this isn't for private people, and it sounded to me like showboating and I think I let my opinion be very strongly stated at the time: I didn't like it, it was showboating and maybe looking for funds, but you'll have to see what happens. I think it's a very sad thing for Mr. Bannon,"" he said.

In February, CNN reported that We Build the Wall had communicated with the administration on plans to build a wall along the southern border and donate it to the US government.

Text messages and 'secret deal'

Prosecutors appear to have reviewed text messages between Bannon, Badolato and others that show the $100,000 was intended as salary for Kolfage, and that in each of the following two months, Bannon paid Kolfage another $20,000 in monthly salary ""consistent with the secret deal Bannon had approved.""

When Kolfage texted Badolato to say the We Build the Wall group would have to disclose payments to the non-profit in its tax filings, according to the indictment, Badolato replied, ""better than you or me lol.""

After Kolfage told Badolato to make the payments to Kolfage's spouse, the non-profit filed a tax form falsely saying it had paid his spouse for ""media,"" according to court filings.

In subsequent months, Kolfage's ""secret monthly salary"" was allegedly passed through other third-party entities that prosecutors described as purported vendors for We Build the Wall, and eventually through a new shell entity created by Shea to ""conceal the source and nature of the payments,"" which Kolfage told Shea they could describe as for ""social media.""

In October 2019, however, Kolfage, Bannon and Badolato began taking steps to conceal their behavior after learning from a financial institution that We Build the Wall might be under federal criminal investigation, according to the indictment.

At that point, Kolfage and Bannon began using encrypted messaging applications on their phones, Kolfage stopped receiving secret salary payments and a statement on the group's website that said he wasn't receiving compensation disappeared, according to the indictment. Instead, the website subsequently read that he would be paid a salary beginning in January 2020.

According to a law enforcement official, officials at Justice Department headquarters were briefed in advance of the indictment of Bannon and others, but this person didn't indicate when that briefing occurred.

Attorney General William Barr's abrupt removal of then-Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman in June drew scrutiny of Barr's relationship with the New York prosecutors' office, but department officials have said the firing wasn't related to the handling of any particular case.

Bannon's history with Trump

Bannon was once an influential voice inside the White House as Trump's chief strategist, until he was ousted by the President in August 2017.

Bannon had helped run Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, alongside now-White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, and was credited as a driving force behind Trump's populist appeal, nationalist ideology and controversial policies.

Furious from an interview in which Bannon was quoted contradicting Trump on North Korea and claiming he had authority to make personnel changes at the State Department, Trump fired Bannon.

He and the President had a falling-out in 2018 after Bannon was quoted calling an infamous 2016 meeting of a Russian lawyer, Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner ""treasonous.""

Before joining Trump's campaign, Bannon was the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that traffics in incendiary headlines, many of them outwardly racist, misogynist, anti-Semitic. Bannon returned to Breitbart after leaving the White House, but left again in 2018.

We Build the Wall controversy

We Build the Wall Inc., a group founded by Air Force veteran Kolfage, gained national attention after raising millions of dollars in a GoFundMe campaign, and launching two private wall projects in New Mexico and Texas. Those projects were constructed on private land -- a strategy that largely shielded them from government intervention.

Kolfage has come under scrutiny for his inflammatory rhetoric and promises. In the past, he's been accused by some of his donors as overpromising and underdelivering. Other allegations against him include being clandestine in his operations and unwilling to disclose certain logistics. He often uses his Twitter account to spar with or confront liberal critics. In the past, Kolfage has defended himself against criticism.

He previously told CNN that his group is a ""game-changer for border security"" and is ""trying to make America safer.""

As of October 2019, the group said it raised roughly $18.5 million in direct donations, with an additional $6 million in pledged donations dependent on meeting ""certain milestones,"" according to its website. The group said it had more than 500,000 donors.

We Build the Wall has been the subject of an ongoing federal lawsuit brought by the North American Butterfly Association, which oversees a 100-acre wild butterfly habitat near the private wall's Texas location, along the banks of the Rio Grande.

""WE TOLD YOU SO!!!"" tweeted the National Butterfly Center in part on Thursday, accusing Bannon of a ""scheme to raise dark money"" for the administration.

""We are happy the Justice Department is moving quick on this to stop people like this from profiting off hate and divide,"" Javier Peña, a lawyer for the center, told CNN.

The center's lawsuit alleges that the private wall effort could cause permanent damage to neighboring properties by changing the flow of surface water.

As a part of the litigation, the center documented erosion at the base of the private wall in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna in July. Photos of the wall, viewed by CNN, show cracks in the ground between the wall and the river.

374,"A trove of documents obtained by German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung has shed light on how co-founders of an intensely nebulous, Bermuda-based offshore investment vehicle, Meridian Capital, obtained generous loans from a major Kazakhstani bank whose survival was only made possible by multibillion dollar government bailouts.

That is among multiple revelations in an article published over the weekend by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP  one in a consortium of outlets poring through 6.8 million confidential records leaked from Bermuda law firm Appleby, which handled paperwork for Meridian, a highly diversified entity involved in the energy, real estate, mining, banking, aviation and transportation sectors.

In another explosive detail, the OCCRP reported the hitherto unknown fact that one of Meridians founders appears to have been Sauat Mynbayev  current chief executive of Kazakhstans state-owned KazMunaiGaz oil and gas company, and a former oil and gas minister, from 2010 to 2013.

But it is the alleged role of Kazkommertsbank that is going to cause the government most headaches in the foreseeable future.

OCCRP claimed in their report that Appleby data shows that other Meridian co-founders included top executives and shareholders of Kazkommertsbank, a lender that now operates under the Qazqom brand.

It was this bank that provided the easy credit that made Meridian an empire that now stretches from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia, and even Australia, the report noted. [The] leak reveals that the group used a large portion of the banks deposits to fund project after project. This enabled them to grow quickly, and at little risk to themselves.

But one piece of correspondence from an unidentified central bank official states that whenever Meridian projects would fail, the losses would simply be dumped onto the banks books.

This is significant as Kazkommertsbank has endured severe liquidity crises that prompted the government in March to use $7.5 billion in state funds to clear the institutions mountain of bad loans. That bailout was rushed through in advance of a merger between Kazkommertsbank and another top lender, Halyk Bank, which is controlled by President Nursultan Nazarbayevs second daughter, Dinara, and her husband, Timur Kulibayev.

The OCCRP said it was unable to estimate the extent of the damage caused to state coffers by Kazkommertsbanks lending to Meridian, but suggested that Kazakhstans citizens could be on the hook for billions of dollars.

The timing is mortifying for Nazarbayev, who publicly complained only a few days ago about purported shenanigans at RBK Bank  far smaller entity than Kazkommertsbank. Shady practices at that lender, the president said, has culminated in accountholders being unable to access their savings.

Thieves should go to jail, which is where they will be sent, Nazarbayev said on November 3, speaking to a congress of the ruling Nur Otan party.

Unlike for Kazkommertsbank, there has been no talk yet of a bailout for RBK.

Still, Kazkommertsbank is likely to be shielded from excessively nosy coverage in local media, which is almost all largely loyal to the authorities. On November 6, some online outlets had cursorily referred to the OCCRP report and the wider document leak, which has been branded Paradise Papers, but without dwelling on any of the specific details or mentioning the Kazkommertsbank connection. Almost all local reports are straight pick-ups of a sweeping article on Paradise Papers by Russias TASS news agency.

The government will likely be actively engaged in containing the damage.

When unsubstantiated rumors began spreading last week, via a popular mobile phone communicator app, about Kazkommertsbank being on the verge of bankruptcy, the bank was swift to put out a statement of denial.

To protect the interests of the bank, we have filed a statement with law enforcement bodies with the aim of finding the source disseminating the rumor, Kazkommertsbank said in its statement.

As of the late afternoon on November 6, Mynbayev had yet to make a public statement about a report that identified him as once controlling 18.75 percent of Meridian. The OCCRP supported that claim by citing a 2006 document that named Askar Alshinbayev, Yevgeniy Feld, Nurzhan Subkhanberdin, Nina Zhussupova, Azat Abishev and Ian Connor as the other shareholders. OCCRP cited a much more recent UK disclosure by Meridian as naming Alshinbayev, Subkhanberdin and Feld as beneficiaries, but not Mynbayev.

Meridian certainly seems to have proven lucrative for its owners.

Previously leaked notes from a 2005 meeting between Connor and officials with HSBC has the Meridian shareholder estimating the companys assets at around $1.2 billion.

In that meeting, Connor  said he had received a $9 million dividend payment from the group the previous month, OCCRP reported.

Connor said Meridians investment ranged included Kazakhstani gold and oil companies and a mine in South Africa.

As OCCRP has documented, the chronology of Meridians rise appears to closely track successes in Mynbayevs career. Meridian was founded in 2002. The following year, Mynbayev was appointed deputy prime minister. In 2006, he took over as head of the Samruk sovereign wealth fund. From 2007 through to 2013, he was charged with ministerial portfolios that gave him ample responsibilities over the countrys energy sector. That role became even more explicit in 2013, when he took over the helm at KazMunaiGaz.",nam

Sears on Thursday named Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a lawsuit against the companys former CEO, Edward Lampert, alleging that Mnuchin was part of a group of board members who assisted Lampert and his hedge fund in stripping the bankrupted retailer of more than $2 billion in assets.

Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, were the largest shareholders in Sears, holding between 47.8 percent and 62 percent of its stock during the time of the alleged violations, from 2011 to 2015, according to the lawsuit. They, along with two other major shareholders named in the suit, received the vast majority of the benefit of spinning off five different company assets, according to the complaint.

Prior to becoming Treasury secretary, Mnuchin was an investor in ESL and a member of ESLs board of directors at all relevant times, the filing says.

By far the largest share of the value siphoned from the Company went to Lampert himself, ESL  and other insider Defendants, the lawsuit says. These transfers were unmistakably intended to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors and/or occurred when the Company was insolvent and had insufficient capital to continue its operations and to repay its billions of dollars in debt.

The suit, brought on behalf of Sears debt holders, also argues that Sears repeatedly produced financial plans reflecting fanciful, bad-faith predictions that the Company would experience an immediate and dramatic turnaround from deep and mounting losses to sudden profitability.

Mnuchin, who was Lamperts roommate at Yale University and worked with him at Goldman Sachs, is named as one of four Sears board members who aided and abetted the shareholders by voting to approve the spinoffs.

Sears declared bankruptcy last October and was acquired by an affiliate of ESL, Transform Holdco, in February.

A spokesperson for ESL Investments said the fund vigorously disputes the claims against ESL, Lampert, and ESL President Kunal Kamlani, another Sears board member.

The debtors allegations are misleading or just flat wrong, he said, arguing that the company was solvent when the spinoff transactions took place and that ESL was a constant source of financing for Sears for many years.

In addition, the company received proceeds in excess of $3.0 billion from these transactions, all of which were applied to reduce debt and fund operations, and all of the referenced transactions treated every shareholder equally from an economic standpoint, the spokesperson said.

All transactions were done in good faith, on fair terms, beneficial to all Sears stakeholders and approved by the Sears Board of Directors, made up of a majority of independent directors, as well as the companys Related Party Transactions Committee, which was itself comprised of independent directors and advised by separate independent financial and legal advisers, he added.",am
376,"WASHINGTON  The Trump administration announced criminal charges against one of China's largest telecommunications companies Monday, a dramatic move that promises to ratchet up tensions on the eve of trade talks this week between the two countries.

Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told reporters in Washington a pair of indictments had been unsealed in two separate cases. A Brooklyn grand jury charged Huawei as a company, and its chief financial officer, Wanzhou Meng, with money laundering, bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Huawei also was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.

A separate indictment accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets from U.S. telecom firm T-Mobile. Those charges stem from a civil lawsuit filed by T-Mobile in 2014 over a robot called ""Tappy,"" which was used in testing smartphones.

""Huawei intentionally conspired to steal intellectual property from an American company in an attempt to undermine the free and fair marketplace,"" the Justice Department said in a statement.

Meng, who was arrested in Canada in December, is accused of orchestrating a scheme to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

The Brooklyn indictment says Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Meng misled U.S. banks into believing that Hawei had no interest in the Hong Kong company, called Skycom, according to the Justice Department.

The indictment also charges Huawei with conspiracy to obstruct justice by destroying evidence and moving employees out of the U.S. so they could not be called as witnesses.

Meng is a daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, who served as an engineer in the People's Liberation Army from 1974 to 1983. The U.S. is seeking her extradition.

""For over a decade, Huawei employed a strategy of lies and deceit to conduct and grow its business,"" said Richard Donoghue, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said the charges ""lay bare Huawei's alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices.""

Huawei (pronounced ""Wah-way"") is second only to Samsung as the world's largest supplier of smartphones and has been heavily involved around the world in building the next generation of cellphone networks, known as 5G. The Trump administration has been pushing other countries to exclude the firm from that work, citing security risks.

Last year, six different U.S. intelligence agencies urged Americans not to buy Huawei phones  which are virtually unavailable in the U.S. And President Donald Trump signed a law blocking federal government agencies from using most of the company's products.

The indictment against a leading Chinese company  and the harsh language senior Trump administration officials used to characterize its conduct  mark a sea change from the Obama administration, which was careful in how it characterized Chinese behavior, even as it secretly saw Chinese hackers siphoning U.S. intellectual property.

Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 16 that federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation of Huawei for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. business partners, including technology used by T-Mobile to test smartphones.

The investigation grew in part out of civil lawsuits against Huawei, the Journal reported, including one in which a Seattle jury found Huawei liable for misappropriating robotic technology from T-Mobile's lab in Bellevue, Washington.

In 2012, the House intelligence committee published an investigation concluding that Huawei and another Chinese telecom giant, ZTE, posed a threat to U.S. national security. The firms are essentially arms of the Chinese government, the House concluded, which aid and abet Chinese espionage and could implant spyware that could allow the Chinese government to easily intercept communications or mount cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, such as nuclear plants and power grids.

The companies deny spying for China.

American intelligence officials have long been concerned that Chinese firms insert ""back doors"" in telecommunications equipment that facilitates eavesdropping. If Chinese companies dominate the construction of 5G networks worldwide, officials fear Chinese spies won't need back doors  they will have direct access to global telecommunications.

Still, U.S. officials have not put forward hard evidence linking Huawei to spying, and critics have pointed out that American spy agencies vacuum large swaths of private information  with court orders  from U.S. technology companies.

Talks aimed at resolving disputes over Chinese technology and trade policies are due to resume in Washington on Wednesday, led by the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.",am
377,"The former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak has been sentenced to 15 years in prison, becoming the countrys fourth ex-leader convicted of corruption.

He was also fined 13bn won (£8.8m) after Seoul Central district court found him guilty of bribery and embezzlement.

Lee served as president from 2008-13 and his conviction follows the jailing in April of his successor, Park Geun-hye, dealing a serious blow to conservatives in South Korea. Park is serving a 33-year sentence for corruption and was forced from office amid large-scale protests.

The 76-year-old did not attend Fridays hearing as a protest against it being televised live. He has consistently denied the charges and said the proceedings were politically motivated. Prosecutors had sought a 20-year jail term.

The court ruled that Lee had accepted bribes from some of South Koreas largest companies, including Samsung, and the countrys intelligence service. He was found to have embezzled about 24bn won through slush funds at an auto parts company called DAS. Lee claimed the firm belonged to his brother but the court ruled that he was the de-facto owner. Bringing everything into consideration, heavy punishment for the accused is inevitable, the court said.

South Korean politicians are often scrutinised for their cozy relationship with the countrys family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, which control vast swaths of the economy. It has led to frequent accusations of criminality across the political spectrum.

During the trial, Samsung was found to have paid Lee about 6bn won in exchange for a presidential pardon for its chair, Lee Kun-hee, who was jailed for tax evasion.

The court also said it was wrong for Lee to continue to deny the charges against him, and admonished him for attempting to shift the blame on to subordinates. The former South Korean leader was indicted in April on 16 charges that included bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.

Lee previously described the case against him as revenge after the liberal president Moon Jae-in, currently in office, was elected. Moon was chief of staff under Roh Moo-hyun, who served as president from 2003 to 2008 and killed himself in 2009 after he was questioned by prosecutors about alleged corruption during Lees tenure. Moon has accused Lee of targeting Roh in an effort to discredit liberal politicians.

378,"Riggs Bank pleaded guilty Thursday to a criminal charge of failing to report suspicious transactions in the accounts of foreigners, including two dictators, and agreed to a $16 million proposed fine.

The guilty plea by Riggs throws into question its deal, announced in July, to be acquired for $779 million by regional bank PNC Financial Services Group of Pittsburgh.

The Justice Department has been investigating the banks handling  at the highest executive levels  of some foreigners accounts, including those held by Saudi diplomats in Washington, former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, and officials of Teodoro Obiangs regime in Equatorial Guinea.

Attorneys representing the bank entered a guilty plea at a hearing before federal judge Ricardo Urbina, who must approve the proposed fine. If he rejects the fine, Riggs and prosecutors may have to renegotiate or take the case to trial.

The bank regrets what has occurred and has cooperated fully with the investigation, Mark Hulkower, an attorney representing the bank, told the judge.

Riggs, an old-line Washington bank that drew prestige from its near-exclusive franchise on business with the capitals diplomatic community, was fined a record $25 million by a Treasury Department agency last May. The civil fine was for alleged violations of laws to prevent money laundering in its handling of millions of dollars in the accounts controlled by Saudi diplomats and Equatorial Guinea officials. The midsize bank, which has since sold its diplomatic and international businesses, did not admit to or deny wrongdoing in the civil case.

The then-head of the Treasury agency, Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, had left open the possibility of criminal charges when he testified to a Senate panel in June, accepting blame for failed oversight of Riggs.

Senate investigators revealed details of the banks questionable dealings: A suitcase stuffed with millions in cash being hauled by a bank officer handling the Equatorial Guinea accounts into Riggss stately Embassy Row branch. Dummy offshore companies allegedly set up by bank managers for Pinochet, whose name was found to have been altered on some of his accounts to deceive international prosecutors. Payments of $445,800 from a big U.S. oil company into the account of a 14-year-old relative of the president of Equatorial Guinea, earmarked for renting office space.

Under the plea agreement, the bank would serve a five-year probation period during which it would submit anti-money laundering programs for review by government regulators. But the probation would end if Riggs is acquired by PNC.",am
379,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The alleged mastermind of a multibillion dollar corruption scandal that rocked Malaysia and Goldman Sachs has broken his silence to claim that he is being cast as a scapegoat and to point fingers at others who he says deserve more blame.

In an interview with The Straits Times, a Singapore newspaper, financier Jho Low downplayed his role in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal, describing himself as an ""intermediary"" who was in demand for his ""good relationships with influential foreign businessmen and decision makers.""

""People and companies act as introducers or intermediaries all the time. This is not a unique situation,"" he said.

The exact location of Low, whose full name is Low Taek Jho, remains unknown. He conducted the interview with The Straits Times over email, representatives for Low confirmed to CNN Business.

US prosecutors have alleged that Low and others used 1MDB as a slush fund, instead of its intended purpose to help develop Malaysia's economy. Prosecutors and officials say that billions of dollars were misappropriated in the global swindle, with millions allegedly spent on luxury handbags and jewelry, one hit movie, a swanky New York condo, a $250 million yacht, a Picasso, and parties and gifts for Low's celebrity friends.

Low, 38, said in the interview that he is ""an easy target"" compared to the global financial institutions, companies and advisers linked to the scheme. Those institutions, he said, bear ultimate responsibility for any transactions related to the 1MDB scandal.

Malaysia filed criminal charges against 17 current and former Goldman Sachs (GS) employees last August, including the bank's top international executive. The Malaysian government has accused Goldman Sachs and some of its bankers of misleading investors about three bond sales for 1MDB and fraudulently diverting billions worth of the proceeds.

The bank has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and claimed that it was misled by rogue employees who intentionally deceived its legal and compliance teams. It called the charges ""misdirected.""

Tim Leissner, Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman, pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiring to steal money from the state investment fund. He blamed a ""culture"" at Goldman that he claimed encouraged executives to work around the legal team to score business.

Last October, Low struck a $700 million deal with the US government to end a legal case against him. The agreement, which covers assets located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, represented the biggest ever civil forfeiture secured by the department, and the largest recovery to date under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.

In a statement via his lawyers at the time, Low said ""the agreement does not constitute an admission of guilt, liability or any form of wrongdoing by me or the asset owners.""

Low still faces criminal charges in Malaysia, as well as federal charges in New York for conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB and conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying bribes to various Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials.

Low called the Malaysian government's ""repeated attacks"" on him ""politically motivated.""

He said he can't comment on the pending legal case in the United States, adding that his ""team continues to engage in a constructive and open dialogue with the Department of Justice.""

The 1MDB scandal also helped bring down former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was hit with dozens of corruption-related charges in the case. His trial in Malaysia is ongoing, and he has pleaded not guilty.",am
380,"A lie keeps growing and growing, until it is clear, Pinocchio. Every time we use lie as an instrument to win our way towards our goal, we fail to comprehend how it will hurt us in the long run. The Satyam fraud case is no exception to the quote. It unveiled the potholes that existed in the corporate governance of our country. The great stock market scandal which is known as the Indian version of Enron shook the entire country in 2009.

The then founders of Satyam were found guilty of committing fraud worth 7000 crores. They fooled the government, markets and customers by cooking up numbers in their financial statements. The Satyam scam shed light upon various errors that sustained in the Indian legal system.

But how did it all start? How were they able to commit fraud of such magnitude? Who was involved? And what was the result? Find out all the details of the great scam below.

The Satyam Scam: the beginning of the great fall

Satyam computer services ltd was started in 1987 at Hyderabad by the Raju brothers, Rama Raju and Ramalinga Raju. The company was quite successful. Hence, they went forward to get it listed. The company got listed in the Bombay stock exchange in 1991. At that time the shares of Satyam ltd were oversubscribed by 17 times. The company proved to be a master in its field and bagged multiple awards. Ramalinga Raju became the chairman in 2006 and got the award for the Ernest and Youngest Entrepreneur in 2007. Soon their annual revenue touched 1 billion and by the end of 2008, it crossed 2 billion. The company spread its wings to 20+ countries and the business bloomed day by day. Or, so it was believed.

Tensions started when the brothers decided to merge with the company called Matyas. Matyas was held and managed by Raju's family. The merger of the two companies gave rise to various legal issues leaving Raju brothers in trouble. Suddenly Raju resigned his position as a chairman and released a confession letter of 5 pages. In it, he admitted committing a fraud of 7000 crores.

Why and how did he do that?

The Raju brothers conspired such a huge scam to increase their revenue fictitiously. An increase in revenue projected a tremendous increase in profits. This attracted a lot of investors which in turn made the share price reach new heights. The Satyam brothers, who were the founders and promoters of Satyam companies used this opportunity and sold their holdings at a much higher price. They took a profit of 1200 crores through the sale.

The brothers did this by adjusting and modifying the books and bank statements to act in their favor. Most companies make use of ERP system for accounting. But the Raju brothers used their strength and developed their ERP system for accounting purposes. This system, unlike its counterparts, had numerous loopholes. Hence, the insertion of fictitious invoices and fictitious bank statements became a childs play for the brothers. The projected fake bank statements held more money than the actual one. They simply converted this money into a fixed deposit account. The value of such fixed deposits was roughly around 5000 crores.

The PWC who were the auditors of the Satyam companies failed in their job terribly. They did not verify the invoices or bank statements. Physical verification wasnt conducted as well. Nearly 7,561 fake bills were created and the auditors couldnt spot it for about 7-8 years.

The board of directors demanded to get those FDs invested in some profitable avenues. That is when the brothers decided to invest it in Matyas. However, the board did not like the decision. This gave rise to a lot of problems which made the share prices fall drastically. The company was subjected to answer numerous questions. The pressure started building up. Unable to find a new escape plan the brothers decided to confess the truth.

Governments reaction to it

It was like riding a tiger without knowing how to get down without being eaten, Raju said in one of his confession letters. The CBI took charge of the case and started the investigation. The Raju brothers and the auditors were sentenced to prison and were charged a huge sum as a penalty. The company was taken over by Tech Mahindra. Following the scam, the Government and SEBI took various steps to tighten the grip on such perpetrators in the future. They brought several new regulations under the Companies Act of 2013. SEBI amended the ""clause 49"". Now companies are obliged to change their auditors every 10 years. Several safeguards and protective measures are brought into the picture.

India learned a lot from the Satyam fraud case. Indian laws are still developing. A fraud like that has a little probability to take place again. Now the big stock market scam is nothing but a story of what not to do.",am
381,"Embattled lender Metro Bank has been hit with a fresh lawsuit by a group of Iranian customers who say their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.

The group of 17 claimants, who are expected to seek at least £1.5m in damages, include dual British-Iranian citizens, Iranian citizens living in the UK and several UK-based businesses including an engineering firm and a consultancy.

Law firm Ronald Fletcher Baker said its clients were blocked from accessing their accounts and cash between May and September 2019 without notice and without explanation. It first contacted Metro about the issue in July and served the bank with legal papers last week.

Rokhsareh Vahid, a sanctions and banking specialist at the law firm, said: Our clients are all UK residents and they have made it clear to Metro Bank that they did not use their accounts in an unlawful or illegitimate manner.

Metro Bank has not alleged that any of the claimants were involved in any illegal or illegitimate activities and it has released the restrictions on some accounts during this process, which effectively confirms that our clients were not involved in any wrongdoing, she added.

Vahid said her clients suffered financially and one business had been forced to lay off staff after its accounts were restricted for nearly two months.

She said: One can imagine how difficult it would be for individuals to meet their financial responsibilities when their account is suddenly restricted without an explanation and the restriction continues for so long.

The legal threat is the latest headache for Metro, which is also facing a US class action suit over an accounting blunder on its loan book between March 2018 and May 2019. It was filed after the lender revealed the error involving the misclassification of £900m of loans as less risky than they were. The lender is awaiting the result of a regulatory investigation linked to the error. Metro Bank has said that it plans to vigorously defend itself against the class action.

Metro is also reviewing its compliance controls after breaching US sanctions in Iran and Cuba between 2017 and 2019. There is no evidence to suggest that the breaches and the account suspensions referred to in the latest lawsuit are related.

Commenting on the fresh lawsuit, a Metro Bank spokeswoman said: Metro Bank takes its responsibilities, in line with UK regulations, to ensure the integrity of the UK financial system and protect it from financial crime, very seriously. Metro Bank will defend itself vigorously should this go any further.

Any potential trial is expected to take place in mid-2021.",nam
382,"The top prosecutor in the Maldives has filed money-laundering charges against Abdulla Yameen over allegations the former president received one million dollars stolen from state coffers in the countrys biggest-ever corruption scandal.

The charges, which carry a jail sentence of up to 15 years, were filed on Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the prosecutor generals office.

Yameen, 59, who suffered a decisive defeat in last years presidential election, has denied any wrongdoing.

During his tenure, more than $79m obtained by the Maldives tourism board from leasing islands for tourism were diverted to private accounts, cashed out, and used to bribe politicians.

The case was the subject of an Al Jazeera investigation in 2016.

For the president, it was even difficult [to carry those bags], said one of the three men who claimed he carried cash to Yameen.

The charges filed against Yameen on Wednesday relate to claims he received at least one million dollars through SOF Private Limited, a private company linked to his former deputy, which was used to launder tourism revenues from the state-owned Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation (MMPRC).

The amount was deposited into the former presidents personal bank account at the Maldives Islamic Bank in October 2015.

Step in right direction

The Maldivess Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) said last month that public funds embezzled from the MMPRC entered the bank accounts of some 155 people. The watchdog did not give details.

Mariyam Shiuna, executive director of anti-corruption group Transparency Maldives, called the charges against Yameen as a step in the right direction in holding public officials to account.

However, the systemic and organised corruption uncovered in the MMPRC investigation show that many individuals were complicit in siphoning off public money, she told Al Jazeera. Without holding these individuals to account, there is room to argue that the prosecution of former President Yameen is targeted persecution.

In a statement last week, the police said Yameen was told to return the amount following an ACC investigation. The former leader claimed he returned the money, but police said its investigation found he did not return the money as ordered and instead conducted financial transactions from which he obtained profit.

Lawyers for Yameen, in a statement last week, dismissed the charges against the former president as an attempt to influence the Maldivess upcoming parliamentary elections, set to take place on April 6.

The ACC has so far failed to prove the one million dollars transferred to Yameens account by SOF Pvt Ltd was state funds obtained through corruption, the lawyers contended.

Yameen told reporters in January that the one million dollars deposited to his private account at the Maldives Islamic Bank was given to him by various parties as campaign funds. The money was his, he added, saying he did not return the amount because there was no proof it was government money.

Police have also sought charges of false testimony against Yameen and his top legal counsel.

The former president is also under investigation in a separate money-laundering case, in which he is alleged to have received 22 million rufiyaas ($1.5m) in cash days before the presidential election in September 2018.

In December, the police said authorities froze Yameens bank accounts and seized more than 100 million rufiyaas (six million dollars) in US dollars and local currency.",am

Daniel Kamensky, the founder of distressed debt hedge fund Marble Ridge Capital, was arrested and charged with fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of retailer Neiman Marcus, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday. 

Kamensky, a member of the retailers unsecured creditors committee, had earlier landed in hot water over his alleged attempts to suppress a rival bid for Neiman Marcuss MyTheresa e-commerce business so that Marble Ridge could buy the asset at a lower price, according to a preliminary report submitted as part of the bankruptcy proceedings by the U.S. Department of Justices Office of the United States Trustee. Kamensky then attempted to persuade the rival bidder to cover up the scheme, according to an announcement from the DoJs Southern District of New York. 

As alleged, Daniel Kamensky disregarded his fiduciary responsibility to unsecured creditors of Neiman Marcus  and broke the law  when he attempted to coerce a competitor to withdraw a higher bid for assets of the bankruptcy estate, said acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement Thursday. As further alleged, acknowledging the illegality of his actions, Kamensky then attempted to obstruct an investigation by trying to persuade the competitor to change his account of the coercion, telling the competitor that otherwise this is going to the U.S. Attorneys Office.  As todays charges show, Kamensky was right about that.

Strauss appeared to be referring to a phone call Kamensky made to an employee at Jefferies  the rival bidder, of which Kamensky was a client  after Kamensky had sent a chat message to the employee saying, DO NOT SEND IN A BID. (Jefferies was not named in Thursdays complaint.)

After learning that the employee had notified others about the message, he called the employee and said, [I]f youre going to continue to tell them what you just told me, Im going to jail, OK? Because they're going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right? Maybe I should go to jail, according to court documents. 

Today, weve removed the maybe, and forced him to answer for his conduct, said FBI assistant director-in-charge William Sweeney in the announcement. 

A spokesperson for Marble Ridge said the firm declined to comment on the charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges in the matter on Thursday.

Kamensky further said that he would use his official role as co-chair of the committee to prevent the investment bank from acquiring the [MyTheresa] securities, according to the complaint. Kamensky also stated that Marble Ridge had been a good partner to the investment bank, but that if the investment bank moved forward with its bid for the [MyTheresa] securities, Marble Ridge would cease doing business with the investment bank.

During a subsequent interview with the Office of the United States Trustee, Kamensky said his calls to the Jefferies employee were a terrible mistake and profound errors in lapses of judgment [that] violated the personal and professional belief I tried my best to live by, according to the complaint.

Kamensky, a former partner at hedge fund Paulson & Co., founded Marble Ridge in 2015. Marble Ridge managed more than $1 billion, according to the complaint. 

Kamensky has been charged with one count of fraud in the offer or sale of securities, one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion and bribery in connection with a bankruptcy, and one count of obstruction of justice. Each of the charges carries maximum sentences ranging from five to 20 years in prison.  

After news of Kamenskys actions on the MyTheresa bid broke last month, Marble Ridge sent a letter to its investors informing them that it planned to wind down. 

After much consideration, and in light of the operating environment, we have made the difficult decision to commence an orderly wind-down of the Marble Ridge funds, Marble Ridge told clients in a letter, according to a Reuters report on August 20. 

Last week Neiman Marcus filed a complaint against Marble Ridge and a temporary restraining order to block the fund from winding down its operations until it pays the retailer $55 million it alleges it is owed in damages. ",am
385,"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA: Brazil's central bank effectively suspended a newly-launched system allowing users of Facebook Inc's WhatsApp messaging service to send money via chats, ordering Visa and Mastercard to halt payments and transfers via the system.

The central bank said in a statement that rolling out the service without previous analysis by the monetary authority could damage the Brazilian payments system in the areas of competition, efficiency and data privacy.

The system, launched last week in a nationwide rollout, allowed users to transfer funds to individuals or local businesses within a chat, attaching payments as they would a photo or video.

The central bank's move is the latest setback in payments for owner Facebook, which pared back its plans for a global payments system called Libra after meeting stiff resistance from regulators. WhatsApp has over 120 million users in Brazil, its second-largest market behind India, where it has also struggled to roll out a payments system.

If Visa and Mastercard do not comply with the order, they would be subject to fines and administrative sanctions, the statement said.

A WhatsApp spokesperson said the messaging service would continue working with ""local partners"" and the central bank to provide digital payments for its users in Brazil using a business model open to more participant, which would address regulators concerns on market concentration.

Earlier on Tuesday, before Visa and Mastercard operations with WhatsApp were suspended, the central bank issued regulation saying it could require market participants to receive previous approval to operate in payments.

WhatsApp launched its Brazil services without requesting central bank authorization, as it was operating as an intermediary between consumers and financial institutions.

Some observers called the regulator's decision an overreaction, while others said WhatsApp presented a potential risk in terms of market concentration and privacy.

""It is a bit odd that the central bank decided to suspend WhatsApp as the regulator is already able to oversee all market participants which joined WhatsApp,"" said Carlos Daltozo, co-head of equities at Eleven Financial. ""Besides that, WhatsApp is open to form new partnerships.""

WhatsApp started its operations in Brazil in partnership with fintech Nubank, state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA , Visa, Mastercard and lender Sicredi.

In a separate setback for the venture on Tuesday, Brazil's antitrust watchdog, Cade, blocked WhatsApp's partnership with credit and debit card operator Cielo to process the payments.

As Cielo is already Brazil's largest payment processor, a partnership with the biggest messaging service could pose a market concentration risk, Cade said. Shares in Cielo soared 30per cent on the day WhatsApp announced payments service in Brazil.

The central bank's move comes as the regulator prepared to launch its own instant payments system in November, called Pix, joining more than 980 participants.

""It is complicated when the regulator also becomes a player and seems to be more worried about its own payment system,"" said a source at a financial institution that has partnered with WhatsApp.

The WhatsApp spokesperson said it was committed to working with the central bank to integrate systems once Pix became available.

Private banks have also been wary about opening valuable client data to tech giants such as Facebook. Some executives have also pointed to security issues as well as a lack of accountability if a transaction goes wrong.

Mastercard said it would comply with the central bank ruling and continue to develop an innovative payment environment.

Facebook and Visa did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Cielo declined to comment.",nam
386,"It's the largest global corruption scandal in modern history.

Its web of bribes spread over four continents, implicated presidents and involved 12 countries. It also prompted the biggest fine ever levied by the U.S. Justice Department -- $3.5 billion.

At the center of this scandal is a company that few in the United States recognize: Odebrecht.

Based in Brazil, Odebrecht is Latin America's largest construction firm. It doled out nearly $800 million in bribes to individuals between 2001 and 2016. Some bribes filtered through the United States.

Investigators are determining whether the bribes extended to construction contracts for the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Some former Latin American presidents face potential jail time for allegedly being involved in the bribes and one has gone missing.

This month, a U.S. judge will rule whether Odebrecht must pay the record-setting fine announced in December. The fine could go as high as $4.5 billion.

Odebrecht, which pled guilty, says it can't pay either amount.

Most of its bribes were paid to get contracts from governments to build roads, bridges, dams and highways.

Odebrecht officials shipped cash across the globe -- from one shell bank account to the next -- en route to politicians' pockets in a dozen countries, including Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Mozambique.

Bribes sometimes went through as many as four shell bank accounts before arriving at the final destination, according to the firm's plea agreement with U.S. officials.

The fine -- coordinated by the U.S., Brazil and Switzerland -- only marks the start of Odebrecht's financial pain. Several Latin American countries are opening up their own cases and could issue more fines.

""This case is the most important and momentous investigation into corruption crimes in the history of the region,"" Sergio Rodriguez, Argentina's federal prosecutor investigating Odebrecht, told CNNMoney.

The first signs of bribery popped up three years ago in a Brazilian investigation dubbed ""Operation Car Wash"" which led to the arrest of an executive at Petrobras, Brazil's government-run oil company. Petrobras also played a leading role in the bribery ring.

The corruption probe across Petrobras and Odebrecht has imprisoned Brazil's most prominent politicians and business owners. The scandal is a central reason why Brazil is in its worst recession in history.

The Petrobras executive later named names in a plea agreement. Investigators later found that Odebrecht replicated its bribery model across most of Latin America and Africa.

The case continues to reverberate globally.

In March, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos admitted his re-election campaign in 2014 accepted a donation from Odebrecht. Santos said he had no knowledge of its origin and called for an investigation. Odebrecht received public works contracts from the Colombian government.

In February, police in Peru raided the home of former president Alejandro Toledo for allegedly accepting a Odebrecht bribe. Toledo denied the charges via Twitter but has gone missing, is thought to be in the U.S., and could face jail time.

Brazil's former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, faces potential prison time for allegedly accepting Odebrecht's paying for his family's vacation home.

His successor, former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year for separate charges, though the massive corruption scandal loomed over her ousting.

Last week, Brazil's former House Speaker, Eduardo Cunha, got 15 years in prison for, among three charges, money laundering bribes involving Petrobras, Odebrecht and politicians.

Brazil's current president, Michel Temer, has lost five of his cabinet officials since taking office in May. Many of them resigned after bribery allegations involving Odebrecht surfaced.

The company's former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, was sentenced to 19 years in prison a year ago.

In Argentina, Rodriguez, the federal prosecutor, is starting to investigate $35 million in Odebrecht bribes to middle men that allegedly gave the money to Argentine government leaders. He says he doesn't know how many people are involved or how long the case will take.

More charges are likely in the pipeline across Latin America.

To get shorter prison terms, Odebrecht officials struck plea deals with investigators, naming names and giving details about the breadth of the scheme during closed door testimonies.

Much of their testimonies is still sealed up but leaks have revealed hints at what's to come.

The music could stop for many more government leaders across the continent once the full testimony is public later this year.

""The tentacles potentially go sea deep in the Brazilian government,"" says Kathleen Hamann, a lawyer at the firm Pierce Atwood and former U.S. Justice Department official who specializes in foreign corrupt practices in Latin America. ""The domestic impact is potentially very grave.""

No leader appears to be immune from the investigation in Latin America, which has long had a high tolerance for corruption.

The difference this time around is two things: 1) the unprecedented size and scope of the case and 2) a key law passed in a few Latin American nations called ""corporate liability.""

Corporate liability means it's easier for investigators to find a company guilty instead of its individual employees. That increases a firm's willingness to cooperate and play by the rules because the company's shareholders want to make sure they don't lose their money.

Still, prosecutors face a tricky problem: They could risk jobs for thousands of workers if Odebrecht goes into bankruptcy due to a flood of fines, experts say.

It's not just its own employees. The company does business with many other firms across Latin America that depend on Odebrecht's business.

With many countries' economies struggling to grow, especially Brazil with record-high unemployment, prosecutors' desire to protect workers could allow Odebrecht to survive.

""No one wants Odebretch to go into bankruptcy...the government wants to preserve jobs,"" says Alexandre Garcia, associate director of Fitch Ratings in Brazil. ""Does it survive? Well yes, it does. But survival doesn't mean that it won't come out of this smaller.""",am
387,"BUENOS AIRES  Assets belonging to former Argentine president Cristina Kirchner were frozen Friday after she was charged with damaging national finances by manipulating the Central Banks exchange operations during her last months in office.

Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio said it was evident that the then president gave instructions  which without a doubt were developed jointly  to her economy minister to carry out the financial operation, according to a statement released on the Supreme Courts website.

Bonadio ordered assets worth 15 million pesos ($1 million) held by Kirchner to be frozen.

He delivered the same charge and asset freeze against Axel Kicillof, Kirchners minister of the economy from 2013 to 2015, and against former Central Bank president Alejandro Vanoli and 12 other former members of its board.

Kirchner, who held office from 2007 to 2015, is accused of having caused a loss in monetary authority through speculative dollar sales by the Central Bank at the end of 2015, just before the election of center-right President Mauricio Macri.

According to the current government, which opposed Kirchner, the operation caused a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars to Latin Americas third-largest economy.

Kirchners defenders say that the issue cannot be taken to court as it concerns disagreements over monetary policy aimed at maintaining the value of the peso.

On December 16, just six days after taking office, Macri ordered measures that led to a 34-percent devaluation of the Argentine peso, resulting in an exchange rate of one dollar per 15 pesos.

Kirchner, 63, left office in December after two consecutive terms and is no longer protected by political immunity.

The leftist former leader appeared in court in mid-April, where she refused to answer questions and instead presented a document demanding Judge Bonadios dismissal.

Bonadio is an open critic of Kirchner, who in the past tried to have him dismissed from his post.

Kirchner has also been implicated in an embezzlement case, and along with her son, has been swept up in legal proceedings over irregularities in family real-estate activities.

In its last year, her presidency was also rocked by the scandal surrounding the death of Alberto Nisman, the Argentine prosecutor who was investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing and Irans role in the terror attack.

Nisman was found dead in January 2015 with a gunshot wound to the head. Though initially ruled a suicide, many suspected foul play.

Days before, Nisman had accused former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of helping Iranian officials hide Irans role in the attack. Fernandez has denied the allegations.

Bipartisan allegations of corruption

Several former Kirchner administration officials have been tainted by allegations of corruption, but the Macri administration also faces problems.

Former planning minister Julio De Vido faces criminal negligence charges for his poor administration of the railroad system, which resulted in a 2012 train crash that killed 51 people and injured 700.

In April two former transportation secretaries, Ricardo Jaime and Juan Pablo Schiavi, were indicted on bribery and fraud charges relating to the purchase of used train stock from Spain and Portugal.

Lazaro Baez, a wealthy entrepreneur close to the Kirchners who obtained lucrative public works contracts, is in prison while he is investigated on money laundering charges.

President Macri himself is being investigated for alleged links to offshore companies named in the Panama Papers tax evasion revelations.",am
388,"Sirleaf was a deputy governor of the institution during the period when the bank notes were illegally ordered. He was arrested along with two central bank colleagues on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The director of banking, Dorbor Hagba, was also arrested on Thursday, while Milton Weeks - central bank governor until he stepped down when President George Weah took office in January 2018 - surrendered to police the next day.

Two other men, named as accomplices, have been evading arrest, according to police. The death of a former senior central bank official on Saturday attracted further public interest in the case. Matthew J. Innis, the institution's one-time deputy director for micro-finance in the regulation and supervision division, was reportedly killed in a hit-and-run road incident.

The American aid agency USAID and the Liberian government funded the investigations which were launched last year in October following the suspected disappearance of newly printed notes worth $100 million (88 million) destined for the Liberian central bank - the equivalent of around 5 percent of the West African nation's gross domestic product.

A London-based firm, Kroll, was hired to carry out the audit. The supposed disappearance led to a travel departure ban on 15 people, including Charles Sirleaf.

""Kroll has identified discrepancies at every stage of the process for controlling the movement of banknotes into and out of the (central bank),"" the risk consultancy said in its report that had been commissioned by the United States at the request of the Liberian government.

$16.5 million missing

A Liberian government report found that notes worth $16.5 million remained unaccounted for and said the bank's management ""deviated from conventional best practices.""

In 2016, Liberia's House of Representatives passed a resolution approving the printing of 5 billion Liberian dollars (US$31 million; 27 million).

The Central Bank requested an additional 10 billion Liberian dollars but the request was denied by the Senate. The bank engaged a company to print the additional banknotes anyway.

""This raised the risk of unintended negative economic effect, including high inflation and the rapid depreciation"" of the Liberian dollar, the report said.

Kroll said its investigation found no evidence of a large shipment of cash going missing as had been reported by local media. Instead, the new bank notes all arrived from a Swedish company but the central bank then failed to properly track what was done with them, the report said.

The report said most of the bank notes are believed to have been put into circulation without authorities removing and destroying the old bills they were designed to replace.

Anderson Miamen, executive director of CENTAL in Liberia, believes that the money went into the pockets of individuals: ""It means the money was misapplied, and misapplication means converting property that is not yours into your personal benefit.""

""If the money isn't available and there is no record of the money being infused into the economy, it means it has to be somewhere.

""And that somewhere would be in private accounts of individuals connected to the process.""

Liberians anxious and disappointed

The report said officials at the central bank were unable to explain who approved the injection of new bank notes without removing the old ones or how the money was infused into the Liberian economy.

Mark Dahen, a Liberian journalist. finds the situation ""utterly embarrassing.""

""Many Liberians were anxious about this report and have been disappointed since this news broke about the missing 16 billion Liberian dollars.""

Several organizations have been pressuring the government to ensure that concrete actions come from this investigation, he told DW.

Critics of President George Weah's government have accused his administration of having had a hand in the poor handling of the bank notes for their personal gain, an allegation they have denied.

Miamen underlined that the malpractice is, first of all, a failure of the government.

""But it is also the failure of the oversight body or the internal control system of the bank.""

He believes that the problem lies with how Liberia is dealing with impunity: ""I can point to the lack of action on or against individuals who [...] abuse their power.""

""What needs to happen is to address impunity on a broader level in this country.""

""The second thing is if institutions or the different agencies were effectively playing their role, if internal controls system were actually exercising their responsibility and doing due diligence, we would have probably not gotten to this point,"" he said.

Not the first Sirleaf scandal

Dahen told DW he believes that this is just more proof that having family members of important politicians in high positions at economic institutions is difficult.

""This is not the first time that members of the Sirleaf family have been the source of scandal. Some years back, Robert Sirleaf was also implicated in some corrupt practices.""

Robert Sirleaf, another son of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was the chairman of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), that went bankrupt under his chairmanship in 2016.

Under his management, 30 million to 40 million US dollars disappeared.

""Generally we can see that there were incidences of corruption or scandals that were reported under the Sirleaf administration."" Miamen said

""Some of the children or family members of the president had very high positions or lucrative positions in government. So this is not a strange news really, in the sense of family members of the president being at the center of kind of controversy.

""Given the incidences of corruption and the dubious nature of some of the dealings under the then leadership of Sirleaf, we can see that it is not strange that something like this is coming up.""

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf herself was listed in the Paradise Papers 2012 as a director of a Bermuda-based financial company. The leak shows how many of Africa's rich and powerful  from the head of Nigeria's Senate, Bukola Saraki, to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia  park their money in offshore havens.",nam

WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today removed Patricia Rosa Vinck, Barakaat International, and Barakaat International Foundation from its Specially Designated Nationals List, having found that Vinck and the two entities no longer present a significant threat of supporting terrorism. Today's action was taken in conjunction with a removal of the three names from the United Nations' 1267 Sanctions Committee (U.N. 1267 Committee) Consolidated List of individuals and entities subject to U.N. sanctions measures.

""The U.S. Government is actively supporting the comprehensive review underway at the U.N. 1267 Committee to ensure the efficacy, accuracy, and fairness of this vital sanctions regime,"" said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. ""We are reviewing the evidentiary records for hundreds of listings  advocating for continued preventative sanctions against those who pose a significant threat of supporting terrorism and removal of those who do not.""

Vinck, Barakaat International, and Barakaat International Foundation were all designated by the Treasury Department under Executive Order 13224 and by the U.N. 1267 Committee. The Treasury Department and the United Nations designated Vinck in January 2003 and the two Barakaat entities in November 2001.

Vinck is the wife of Nabil Abdul Salam Sayadi, who headed the Belgium office of the Global Relief Foundation (GRF), an organization designated in October 2002 by the United States and the United Nations for its support to al Qaida. Vinck served as the secretary of GRF's Belgium office and facilitated GRF's activities. Following U.S. and U.N. sanctions against her, Vinck ceased her activities on behalf of GRF.

The Barakaat organizations were part of a financial conglomerate operating in 40 countries around the world that facilitated the financing and operations of al Qaida and other terrorist organizations. The U.S. and U.N. sanctions against these entities assisted the global effort to prevent them from routing funds to al Qaida and other terrorist groups, and the two organizations are no longer operating. Other designated entities and individuals related to the Barakaat conglomerate remain on the U.S. and U.N. sanctions lists.

The U.N. 1267 Committee is currently implementing a number of procedural and other measures called for by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1822, adopted in June 2008, to improve the effectiveness and fairness of U.N. sanctions. These measures include a comprehensive review of the approximately 500 names on the U.N. 1267 Committee's Consolidated List to be completed by June 2010. The resolution also mandates the establishment and posting on the U.N. 1267 Committee's website of narrative summaries of reasons for the listing of all individuals and entities on the Consolidated List, and updates to the U.N. 1267 Committee's listing and delisting procedures. The United States strongly supports and is participating vigorously in these efforts.

390,"There are several documents and minutes of meetings held by shareholders of Global Medical Response of India Limited, which mention these investments made in Ziqitza.

A company registered by Appleby in tax haven Mauritius invested in an Indian firm that is at the heart of a probe by CBI and ED into what is called the Rajasthan Ambulance scam. One of the founders of the firm is the son of Congress leader and former Union minister Vayalar Ravi.

Global Medical Response of India Limited was registered in Mauritius on March 26 2008 by Appleby and classified as high risk profile. Reason: The company, earlier called Radec X Ltd, invested in Indian firm Ziqitza Health Care Limited which is under scrutiny of investigative agencies. Ziqitza provides ambulance services.

There are several prominent politicians named in the complaint, which was first filed by the Rajasthan police in 2014, immediately after the BJP returned to power in the state, and later by the CBI in 2015. They are: former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot; Karti Chidambaram, son of former finance minister P Chidambaram; former Union minister Sachin Pilot; and, Ravi Krishna, son of former Union minister Vayalar Ravi, who is also one of the founders of the company.

Records of the Registrar of Companies show that for the financial year ending March 31, 2016, among others, Ravi Krishna remains listed as an equity shareholder. In April this year, the ED attached properties worth Rs 12 crore in connection with the scam in which the CBI alleged that the company had made illegal gains of Rs 23 crore between the years 2010 and 2013.

The allegations made by the agencies are that tenders for the contracts given under the NRHM (National Rural Health Mission) were tweaked to favour Ziqitza Health Care Limited and of subsequently generating fictitious claims and invoices, and of making claims on behalf of non-operated ambulances and faking multiple trips.
The ED charged the company with provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Applebys internal documents show, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Mauritius, on September 17, 2015, red-flagged this probe.

EXPLAINED: Why the Paradise Papers matter

This is also echoed in a 2016 Compliance Review Report by Appleby which contains a flowchart of the antecedents of the company. It shows that the company was originally incorporated in 2008 as RADEC X Ltd and, in 2010, the name was changed to Global Medical Response of India Limited. The company is ultimately owned by Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Compliance report notes how ED traced the investment pattern in Ziqitza and that among the companies that invested in it through equity and preference share purchases are Grand Global Impex of Singapore; Acumen Fund Inc of US and, finally, Global Medical Response of India Ltd of Mauritius.

Says Applebys memo dated January 27, 2016: The hits (negative searches) relate to the scam involving the Companys investee company Ziqitza Health Care Limited. Contracts awarded to the investee company are said to have been politically favored. The risk profile of the company has been raised to High and added to our Risky Client Register for frequent checks

SEE PHOTOS | Paradise Papers: Here are the Indians on the list

There are several documents and minutes of meetings held by shareholders of Global Medical Response of India Limited, which mention these investments made in Ziqitza. Records show that a sum of $2.09 million was invested by Global Medical Response of India in Ziqitza Healthcare Limited as 1,000 ordinary shares (0.3% shareholding) and 43,184 Series B Preference shares (61.7% shareholding of Ziqitza Healthcare Limited). But in documents filed with Appleby, this payment of $2.09 million is shown as loan payable to Global Medical Response Inc.

After the CBI action, both Karti Chidambaram and Sachin Pilot distanced themselves from the deal. Karti Chidambaram told The Indian Express: I was briefly a Non Executive Independent Director with the company and have never been a share holder. And as far as I know Ziqitza Health Care never had any off shore operations. A company with off shore operations may have invested in them.

For his part, Sachin Pilot said that once the company changed its status from a non-profit venture to a for-profit venture, he resigned from it and did so before he became a Member of Parliament in 2004. He said: For under a year I was a Honorary Director with the company. This was in 2001. When they informed me that they have become a for profit company I resigned. I have never held a share in it, held a board meeting or signed any papers.

Response from Ravi Krishna

We at Ziqitza Heath Care look at Global Medical Response (GMR) as out strategic investor and yes, they set up GMR India, a separate company in Mauritius. They simply bought a company of-the-shelf and changed its name to GMR India. After all, any company would look at the most efficient way of allocating its resources.

The fact that we have a strategic investor in the Mauritius based company was disclosed by Ziqitza Health Care to the Reserve Bank of India and all banking details and details of RBI permits have subsequently been given by us to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and later, the Enforcement Directorate (ED). All the cases took off when the Government changed and in August 2015, the case went to CBI. The ED action came a month later but my point is: since we have done no wrong, how long will they prosecute us? No charge sheets have been filed and in fact, no one has even been questioned by the ED as yet.

As far as the links of other politicians with Ziqitza Health Care is concerned, both Sachin Pilot and Karti Chidambaram were only independent directors in the company, never shareholders. In fact, Sachin Pilot was associated with the company for only a few months. I myself started with a 25% stake in the company. This later reduced to 11% and now it is only 2% but this is due to personal reasons and a family division of assets.

GMR of India Limited, Mauritius is a 100% subsidiary of GMR Inc (Global Medical Response Inc; http://www.gmr.net/), the global arm of AMR Inc (American Medical Response Inc; https://www.amr.net/home/ national), worlds and USs Largest Ambulance Service Company. They are still part of Envision Health Care Inc (EVHC; https://www.evhc.net/), a New York Stock Exchange company and part of S&P500 with todays market cap of USD 3.29 billion. Kindly note that a public announcement of the sale of AMR (American Medical Response Inc) Division to KKR has been made by EVHC on August 8, 2017. We do not have any details of this deal except from the media and await the AMR / GMR management to brief us in the next board meeting. Pls see the relevant media releases:

391,"Banking giant Wachovia Corp. will pay $160 million to settle a federal investigation into laundering of illegal drug profits through Mexican exchange houses in the largest case of its kind ever brought against a U.S. bank, prosecutors said Wednesday.

""This is historic,"" acting U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sloman said. ""There is no other case like this one anywhere.""

The probe, which began in 2005 when a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics dog in Florida detected cocaine traces in an airplane, ultimately uncovered at least $110 million in drug profits laundered from Mexico through Wachovia. The total settlement includes forfeiture in that amount plus a $50 million fine.

""DEA will follow drug money wherever it leads us,"" said Mark R. Trouville, chief of the DEA's Miami office.

The agreement means Wachovia and its executives will avoid criminal prosecution in return for the $160 million payment and significant improvements in its anti-money laundering program. If those and other conditions are met within one year, potential criminal charges for failure to maintain a system to detect money launderers will be dropped.

Wachovia, now a unit of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., said in a statement that Wells Fargo had already set aside money to pay the settlement. The statement said Wachovia, based in Charlotte, ended its relationships with foreign currency exchange houses in 2008.

""Wachovia Bank has fully cooperated with the federal government throughout the course of its investigation,"" the statement said.

The $160 million fine and forfeiture represents the biggest penalty ever imposed under the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to keep close tabs on suspicious transactions that could indicate money is being laundered from criminal enterprises. According to prosecutors, Wachovia's program was woefully inadequate and bank executives knew it, meaning that numerous red flags were missed over a three-year period.

In fact, officials said Wachovia had no way of checking some $420 billion in transactions from Mexican exchange houses for possible money-laundering activity. That means investigators didn't get potentially key information on drug cartels, terrorist financing networks and other organized crime enterprises.

""The integrity of our financial system is at stake,"" said Charles Steele, deputy director of the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ""It poses a very serious problem, a very serious threat for law enforcement.""

Beginning with that DEA drug-sniffing dog in June 2005, investigators began tracing the source of money for airplanes being used to ferry cocaine in Colombia and Mexico that was ultimately destined for the U.S. Those initial money transfers were overseen by a Wachovia office in Miami.

Ultimately at least $13 million from the Mexican exchanges went through Wachovia for the purchase of aircraft, according to court documents. Four of them were seized by investigators, along with more than 22 tons of cocaine.

From there, investigators from the DEA, Internal Revenue Service and other agencies tracked billions of dollars in wire transfers, bulk cash shipments and other transactions from the Mexican exchanges through Wachovia. Many were considered suspicious, including such tactics as multiple round-number wire transfers on the same day for a single account; deposits of traveler's checks with sequential numbers that contain unusual markings; and bulk cash transfers up to 50 percent larger than a customer had led Wachovia to expect.

Under the agreement, Wells Fargo cannot use taxpayer money provided under the federal financial bailout program  known as TARP  to pay its fine and forfeiture amounts. A Wachovia spokewoman said Wells Fargo fully repaid its TARP money to the government in late 2009, before the money-laundering settlement was finalized.",am
392,"The Premier League striker at the centre of a £1.1million tax fraud investigation is involved in a business whose shareholders include Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish and the head of the one of the most powerful sports agencies in the British game.

Brighton and former Palace striker Glenn Murray, and his wife Stacey, were arrested on Tuesday, with HMRC officers searching their Sussex home. The couple were later released.

Sportsmail can reveal that Murray, his agent Will Salthouse and Parish are shareholders in a chicken restaurant business called Dirtybird Restaurants Limited.

A statement from HMRC confirmed a couple's arrest, adding: 'The man was arrested on suspicion of evading income tax and VAT, and cheating the public revenue. The woman was arrested on suspicion of evading income tax, and cheating the public revenue.'

HMRC said 'business and personal records were seized during the operation'.

The investigation is ongoing but Sportsmail has uncovered details about Murray's business dealings and that of his representative Salthouse at Unique Sports Management. It is understood that HMRC may be examining one of the transfers during the career of Brighton's leading goalscorer.

HMRC would not comment any further on Thursday and the Daily Mail understands that revenue officers had not contacted any officials at Crystal Palace in relation to their former player.

Murray has long been represented by USM, a sports management agency which lists Salthouse as its major shareholder.

On Thursday Salthouse confirmed that Murray was managed by USM but declined to answer any further questions, including enquiries concerning his own stake in Dirtybird Restaurants Limited and the fact that he lists players as shareholders in his USM business. While that is not in breach of any regulations if a player's stake remains below five per cent, football industry insiders do consider such a practice unusual.

In accounts documents listed at Companies House in October 2017, Dirtybird had net assets of more than £2.6m. And in the most recent annual return, filed with Companies House in June 2016, it was stated that Parish had 8.3 per cent of the business with Salthouse, Murray and Wayne Routledge each holding 1.4 per cent.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Parish, or indeed Salthouse, Murray and Routledge, the Swansea City footballer who also has shares in USM.

But asked on Thursday if his shares in Dirtybird represented a conflict of interest when Salthouse has been involved in at least eight Crystal Palace transfers since 2015, Parish declined to comment.

Salthouse, Murray and Routledge invested in Dirtybird following an allotment of shares issued by the company in May 2015. Parish was already a shareholder.

An Anthony Titus is listed at Companies House as a shareholder at USM. It is unclear if Anthony Titus is in fact Dexter Blackstock  the former Southampton and England under 21 forward now acting as an agent who has close links with Salthouse  but Anthony and Titus are Blackstocks middle names. Keith Andrews, the former Irish international footballer, also had a share in USM, but it ended in 2016.

In December 2016 Marlon Fleischmann, who lists Harry Kane among a stellar list of clients, joined USM as a director but what caused more ripples in the football industry was the recruitment of two key figures from the FA.

Until October 2015 Martin Fauvel was a financial regulation officer at Wembley but he caused considerable concern among football agents when he informed them, via email, of his intention to cross the divide into their world and join USM. On Friday he will be listed as the head of operations at USM with a brief to ensure 'legal and regulatory compliance for the company'.

Fauvel was followed 14 months later by Ian Ryder, a former Metropolitan Police detective who was working at the FA as the football integrity and anti-corruption manager.

On LinkedIn Ryder says he is an intermediary for 1st Sports Management but he confirmed on Thursday that he also works on a consultancy basis for USM. He even has a USM business card.

Concern among other football agents centred on the access Fauvel and Ryder might have had to sensitive information about contracts between agents and their players, given that all representation agreements between footballers and intermediaries are lodged at Wembley under FA regulations.

While there is no suggestion such information has been used to USM's advantage, they have become one of the most powerful agencies in the game. USM's last unaudited accounts at Companies House state net assets of £4.48m.

An Irish agent called Eamonn Collins has represented Blackstock in the past, and is understood to be a business associate of Salthouse's. Together with Fleischmann, Collins and Salthouse are listed as directors of a company in Dublin called Cluainweir Limited.

In August 2016 the Brazillian authorities issued arrest warrants for Collins, himself a former footballer, and two other men as part of their investigation into alleged ticket touting at the Rio Olympic Games. The men denied any wrongdoing.

The allegations against those involved, with former Olympic Council of Ireland president Pat Hickey among them, include ticket touting, money laundering and tax evasion. Brazil's Supreme Court suspended the case last November.",am

AIG, which insured Williams vehicle, contacted the City of London Polices Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department in August 2014 after receiving personal injury claims from each of the group. Medical reports were submitted from five individuals.

Officers investigating the case found two of the claimants were friends with Williams on social media. It was further discovered the car involved was hired through a car rental company insured by AIG, meaning it had liability for the crash and any subsequent claims.

Williams, of Barry Island, was sentenced yesterday to 12 months in prison for conspiracy to commit fraud and dangerous driving. He was disqualified from driving for two years and fined £200.

Kassim Mukbill, Nigel Thomas Iti, Hamada Shuyeb, Kieran Murphy, Fahmi Haddad, Aaron Ryan and Matthew Saunders, all aged between 24 and 33 and from the Cardiff area, each admitted fraud and were given a suspended prison sentence, 150 hours community service and a £200 fine.

394,"(Yicai Global) Sept. 8 -- Regulators in China slapped Leshi Internet Information and Technology, a struggling companyonce known as Chinas Netflix, with the countrys biggest-ever financial penalty for stock fraud.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission fined Leshi CNY240 million (USD35.1 million), equivalent to5 percent of the funds it raised in its IPO, the Beijing-based company said in a statement yesterday. Though running deep in the red, the cash-strapped business does have the means to pay.

The CSRC imposed the punishment after wrapping up an investigationinto suspectedillegal information disclosure andfraud around offerings. The watchdog opened the investigation on April 26 last year. But Leshis statementdid not state which share offering formed the subject of the fine.

Based on the amount, the offense must relate to a private placement of shares in 2016 that raised CNY4.8 billion. Leshi raised about CNY730 million in its 2010 listing on theChiNext,the Shenzhen Stock Exchanges Nasdaq-style technology board.

Leshi was delisted on July 21,after losing a total ofCNY30 billionover three straight years that pushed it over the threshold for removal.It was already in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency before delisting. The record fine can have only worsened its plight.

As of the end of June, the company had CNY142 million in revenue, total assets of CNY5.69 billion, CNY20.85 billion in total liabilities, and CNY14.62 billion of negative net assets, according to its semi-annual earnings report.

Government-imposed penalties take priority over all other claims. The company will be able to pay because it had a cash balance of CNY271 million at the end of June.

Leshi has been dragged through the mud by disgraced founder Jia Yueting who borrowed heavily in its name to diversify into new energy vehicles and other ventures that have soured.

Jia, the largest shareholder with a 23.1 percent stake, his elder brother Jia Yuemin, who has 1.6 percent, and parent company Leshi Holding, which holds 0.6 percent, have all had their shares frozen as a probe into the finances of Jias businesses continues.

Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges, said his attorney, Kathryn Keneally, in an email.
Prosecutors said Brockman used encrypted emails with code names, including Permit, Snapper, Redfish and Steelhead, to carry out the fraud and ordered evidence to be manipulated or destroyed.
Brockman, a resident of Houston and Pitkin County, Colorado, is chairman and CEO of Reynolds and Reynolds, a 4,300-employee company near Dayton, Ohio, that sells accounting, sales and management software to auto dealerships. The software helps set up websites, including live chats with potential customers, find loans and calculate customer payments, manage payroll and pay bills.
Reynolds & Reynolds issued a statement saying the allegations were outside Brockmans work with the company and that the company is not alleged to have participated in any wrongdoing.
In 2013, a charitable trust set up by Brockmans late father withdrew a pledged $250 million donation to Centre College, a small liberal arts school in Danville, Kentucky, where Brockman attended class and once served as chairman of the board of trustees.
At the time the school said it was due to a significant capital market event that didnt pan out. A spokesman for Reynolds and Reynolds said in 2013 that the event was a proposed refinancing deal involving Vista Equity Partners, Smiths company.
According to the indictment, Brockman gave an unnamed individual detailed instructions regarding the proposed gift to the college, including talking points, and directed the person to threaten to pull out if his demands were not met. In August, he instructed the person to cancel the gift.
Prosecutors say that Smith used about $2.5 million in untaxed funds to buy and upgrade a vacation home in Sonoma, California; purchase two ski properties in France; and spend $13 million to buy a property and fund charitable activities at his property in Colorado.
Anderson applauded Smith for stepping up, despite the serious nature of his crimes, which occurred from 2000 to mid-2015.
Smiths agreement to cooperate has put him on a path away from indictment, he said.
In 2019, Smith announced to the graduating class at Morehouse College that he would pay off the student loan debt of the entire class, saying that he expected the graduates to pay it forward. The estimated cost was $40 million.

396,"Rajiv Gandhis Bofors Scandal

Uncategorized | No Comments

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi brought the issue of Bofors under the light again. PM slammed Congress in a rally while campaigning in Chaibasa, Jharkhand, for calling him a thief. He accused Rahul Gandhis father of being the actual thief for scamming Indians in the name of Bofors.

Since the last 30 years our politicians, our media and we have been mentioning the name Bofors. The first time when the name came under light, the prime minister of India was Rajiv Gandhi. He or his close dignitaries were accused of taking a bribe of 64 crore Rupees from a Swedish arms company Bofors, for giving it a contract for more than 400 Howitzer guns.

The severity of this scandal was such that it caused Rajiv Gandhi to lose the elections and gave a boost to VP Singhs campaign leading to his win.

How it all started?

In 1984, India elected Rajiv Gandhi as its 9th Prime Minister. He won 404 seats out of 514 Lok Sabha seats while the now ruling party, the BJP, could only manage 2 seats. He succeeded his mother Indira Gandhi who had died by then. Such a big majority was never attained by any other PM of India. His main political agenda while campaigning was to bring computer revolution and end corruption. Being one of the best orators India had ever seen, he had a great influence and was given the name Mr. CLEAN by the general public, but this image couldnt last much longer.

V P Singh coming into the picture

Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was a close ally of Sanjay Gandhi. When Rajiv Gandhi came into power, he appointed V P Singh as the Finance Minister. As Finance Minister V P Singh started a campaign for catching big companies who were committing tax evasions and frauds. Such actions made V P Singh quite popular amongst the general public, who started portraying him as a loyal, honest politician. During his tenure as Finance Minister, the customs revenue went up by 20% and excise revenue went up by 12%.

Things were working well until now but suddenly Rajiv Gandhi decided to transfer V P Singh to the defense ministry. All this happened as V P Singh was preparing the 1987 budget. This is where things started to get a bit hot for Rajiv Gandhi. There were various speculations that either this step was taken as V P Singhs popularity was a threat to Rajiv Gandhi or Rajiv Gandhi had succumbed to pressure from big industrialists who were against V P Singhs strict policies. Although Rajiv Gandhi attributed all this to growing tensions between India and Pakistan, the real reason remains unknown.

The clash within the Congress party

Mr. Bhure Lal, Director of the Enforcement Directorate, on 6th Feb 1987 sent a note to Revenue Secretary Mr. Vinod Pandey. The note had information about Bhure Lal giving work to Fairfax; an American detective agency. The work was regarding tax fraud and tax evasion committed by big companies. The Indian government had a policy stating that whosoever provides information regarding tax evasions and frauds shall be compensated with an amount which will be some percentage of the amount for which the fraud was committed. Fairfax was to be compensated as per this policy.

After a few days of sending the note, Bhure Lal was removed from the position of Director of the Enforcement directorate. This baffled V P Singh, who was Defence Minister by then. He sent a note to his old ministry stating that Bhure Lal had done everything as per his orders. He also accepted that he had kept Rajiv Gandhi in the dark over the issue as he didnt consider it necessary. All these talks in the ministries leaked and got public. The partys senior leadership was led to believe that Fairfax was given contract as an attempt to overthrow the government and all this was endangering Indias freedom. V P Singh was at the center of this controversy. He was being targeted by his own party let alone the opposition. But V P Singh had found a way to silence these attacks.

The HDW Submarine deal

HDW (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft) is a German shipbuilding company. The first time the company was dealt with was when Indira Gandhi was PM. Now the Rajiv Gandhi government gave it a contract for submarines. Though the deal was done before V P Singh, it came to him in the final phases. V P Singh thought that the submarine was a bit overpriced. He contacted the company to bargain on the price.

V P Singh got a telex from the Indian ambassador in Western Germany. It stated that an Indian agent had demanded 7% commission out of the deal. This agent had already been paid, hence, the price could not be reduced. This surprised V P Singh as the government had a policy of no middlemen in any defense deal. V P Singh shared this information with Rajiv Gandhi.

V P Singhs resignation from the defense ministry

There was a very evident tension amongst the two Ministers. Each of them thought that the other was conspiring against him. On 6th April 1987, Rajiv Gandhi set up a commission comprising of two supreme court judges to investigate the Fairfax deal. The commission called upon V P Singh to answer for various Whys, Ifs & Buts of Fairfax deal.

V P Singh had seen the writing on the wall and was ready to counter the situation. On 9th April V P Singh called a press conference at his residence and without discussing with cabinet, gave orders to investigate the HDW submarine deal. On 10th April Rajiv Gandhi summoned V P Singh to answer as to why he had made that decision unilaterally.

V P Singh had made up his mind to resign. He realized that the differences between him & Rajiv Gandhi were insurmountable. Hence, on 12th April V P Singh gave his resignation from the post of defense minister.

Bofors scandal coming into the light

Just 4 days after the resignation of V P Singh, the news broadcasted on Swedish radio relating to Bofors. The broadcast claimed that Bofors had bribed several Indian politicians to get 155mm howitzers deal. This claim had knocked Rajiv Gandhis claim to cleanse the corrupt elements.

The Fairfax and HDW matter was still running in the papers and Bofors came in. It was the budget session of parliament when the Bofors news came in. A lot of hue and cry was made in the parliament. On 20th April, Rajiv Gandhi addressed the parliament. He claimed that there were no middlemen involved in the Bofors deal. He also said that no such commission was given to him or any of his family members. This was the giveaway, as until now nobody had accused him or his family members of anything. It was just that the Indians were involved and nobody knew who they were.

Indian origin journalist Chitra Subramaniam and Editor of The Hindu Mr. N. Ram investigated the scandal. If their investigation is to be believed, a bribe of around 64 crore rupees was taken to finalize the deal.

Involvement of Rajiv Gandhi

When the Bofors deal was done, Rajiv Gandhi was the acting defense minister. The competition to get the howitzer deal was between two companies. One was Swedish company Bofors and the other was a French company named Sophma. Both the companies were in talks from December 1985 to 23rd march 1986. And then within 24 hours, Rajiv Gandhi signed the deal in favor of Bofors.

The then Indian ambassador for Sweden, B.N.Ojha wrote a book on this. He says that Rajiv Gandhi came to Sweden to attend the funeral of Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme. On 15 March 1986, Rajiv Gandhi met the new Swedish Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson and gave his condolences. He also talked about the howitzer deal and assured him that the deal would be done with Bofors. Within eight days of this meet, Bofors got the howitzer deal.

From a Deal to a Scandal

A year later the Bofors deal was again in the news but this time as a scandal. The Indian government thought to persuade the Swedish Government to falsify the claims. With this request, B.N.Ojha wrote to his counterpart in the Swedish government, Karl Johan Oberg. He replied saying that the accused was a private Swedish company, hence, any falsification on the part of the Swedish government wont be right. He also stated that the first step should be an investigation rather than any falsification.

The Indian Government as a measure asked the Swedish to carry out an investigation. But a few days later the Swedish Government denied any investigation being carried out. To this B.N.Ojha again wrote to Karl Johan Oberg asking him as to why they were denying any investigation. Karl replied that on 27th April, Rajiv Gandhi had spoken to Swedish PM. He had asked to stop any investigation as Bofors had made it clear that no middlemen were involved in the deal.

V.P. Singh Expelled

Up till now apart from V.P. Singh likes of Arun Nehru, Arif M. Khan, and V C Shukla were all unsatisfied and in opposition of Rajiv Gandhi. On 15th July 1987, the three union ministers among other ministers had a meeting in Haridwar. Later that evening expulsion of these three ministers was ordered. In an interview when asked the reason for his expulsion, former Union Minister Arif M. Khan replied that there increasing popularity was perceived as a threat by Rajiv Gandhi.

To demonstrate his view on the expulsion of these leaders, V.P. Singh resigned from Rajya Sabha. To this, Rajiv Gandhi replied by expelling V.P. Singh from Congress party. To think that the people expelled by Rajiv Gandhi in the span of a few days were the ones running the whole ministry just a few days back.

Who were the middlemen?

After the resignation of Arun Singh, the then union minister of state for the defense on 18th July 1987, the opposition in Congress party went a notch up. Rajiv Gandhi had to succumb to the pressure in the country. Hence a 30 member Joint Parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the deal. The committee didnt have any member from the opposition parties. As one can perceive, the committee gave the government a clean chit.

But before the JPC could write a report, a report was published in The Hindu on 23rd April 1988. The report was written by Chitra Subramaniam and N. Ram. It claimed that Bofors had credited money in a Swiss bank account named PITCO. The account belonged to British businessman J.P. Hinduja. The government though rejected all these claims saying that the account had no links with the Bofors deal money.

Diary of Martin Ardbo

A few more names came into light when Chitra Subramaniam found a diary linking them to Bofors deal. The diary was of Martin Ardbo, the then president of Bofors. It had information regarding the deal but in coded language. The names involved in the deal were not specified but were demonstrated in codes. The diary mentioned that Qs involvement in the deal could be a problem because of his closeness with R. Q and R were presumably Quattrocchi and Rajiv Gandhi. The diary also mentioned the name of three companies of arms agents involved in the deal. These companies were PITCO, SWENSKA & AE SERVICES. Of these PITCO was J.P. Hindujas company and SWENSKA was of Win Chadha. AE SERVICES though couldnt be linked to anyone at that time.

An investigation of all the Bofors accounts was done by the Indian government. It turned out that one of the accounts was linked to Ottavio Quattrocchi in a swiss bank. Hence, it seemed clear that Quattrocchi got some of the Bofors money

Who was Ottavio Quattrocchi?

Quattrocchi was an Italian businessman who had close ties with the Gandhi family. His proximity to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi through his Italian wife Sonia Gandhi is thought to have contributed to the defeat of the Congress party in the 1989 elections. Quattrocchi, born in Mascali, Province of Catania, Sicily, in 1938. He arrived in India in the mid-1960s as the representative of Italian oil and gas firm ENI and its engineering arm Snamprogetti. His family became close to the Gandhi family based on their connection with Sonia Gandhi.

Quattrocchis influence extended to ministers was noted by V.P.Singh, whose testimony is summarised in a court judgment 

 V.P. Singh, Finance Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi Cabinet, has stated that Quattrocchi had sought an appointment with him on a number of occasions but he did not give him any appointment. Rajiv Gandhi then asked him to meet Mr. Quattrocchi  The link between the public servants, politicians, and Quattrocchi looms large in these deals. The award of Jagdishpur Fertilizer Plant to Quattrocchi, changing the earlier decision for SPIC, is a clear case. 

He won about 60 projects for Snamprogetti. In the process, it also became known that for contracts with India, Quattrocchi was the man to approach.

Rise of V.P. Singh

A proper investigation was being demanded from the government. The Swedish were also obliged to carry out any investigation from there side. But it didnt happen and if it did, it was just for the sake of silencing the uproar in public.

V.P Singh was very benefitted with all this nuisance happening in the government. After leaving Congress he became popular among the general public and was recognized as the face of new anti-corrupt India.

As all this was happening, a Lok Sabha seat in Allahabad got vacant. This seat was left vacant by Amitabh Bachan, who was also being pulled into the Bofors controversy but was given a clean chit later. V.P. Singh stood from this seat as an independent candidate and was later supported by the entire opposition apart from Congress and BSP. In his opposition was Sunil Shastri, the son of late Lal Bahadur Shastri. V.P. Singh won this election by a big margin.

Formation of Janta Morcha

V.P.Singh, V.C.Shukla, Arun Nehru, Arun Singh, Devi Lal, and some others came together to form Janta Morcha. The election season was on the verge and the campaigning had started. V.P. Singh took the Bofors deal from Parliament to the people. V.P. Singh while campaigning, claimed that Rajiv Gandhi too had got the money from the Bofors deal via a bank account named LOTUS and was adamant to prosecute all those who had defrauded the government.

Finally, the election of 1989 brought loss to Congress. The party which had bagged more than 400 seats in 1984 could only manage 195 seats in 1989. On the other hand, V.P.Singhs Rashtriya Morcha bagged 146 seats. Congress still being the largest party was requested upon by the President to form the government, which Rajiv Gandhi rejected, hence, the Janta Morcha, supported by BJP and other opposition parties formed the government under the leadership of V.P.Singh.

V.P.Singh, as promised, went after Bofors and gave CBI the orders to investigate the deal. His party although couldnt last to see the outcomes of the investigation as after 11 months of being in power the party lost majority.

What happened to the accused?

The main breakthrough in the Bofors case happened in 1993 in a Swedish Supreme Court. It was found that Ottavio Quattrocchi and his wife Maria Quattrocchi were the actual owners of AE SERVICES. During this time Quattrocchi was in India itself, but as soon as he found out that the court had ruled against him, he fled.

A lookout notice was released against him. After this, he was found in three different places but due to lack of conviction and effort from CBI and authorities, the Indian government was unable to bring him back.

A charge sheet was filed by CBI on 22 October 1999. This charge sheet was filed against Win Chadha, Ottavio Quattrocchi, Bofors company and its president Martin Ardbo. The charge sheet had charged Rajeev Gandhi too, but since he had died in 1991, no trial was carried out on him. In the year 2000, a supplementary charge sheet was filed in which Shreechand Hinduja, Gopichand Hinduja, and Prakashchand Hinduja were also charged.

In 2002, Win Chadha died and in 2005 the case against the Hinduja brothers was also dismissed. On 6 February 2007, Quattrocchi was detained in Argentina based on the Interpol warrant. The Indian investigating agency CBI came under attack for putting up a half-hearted effort towards his extradition. India lost the case for his extradition in June 2007. The judge remarked that India did not even present proper legal documents. Consequently, India was asked to pay Quattrocchis legal expenses.

The CBI appealed to Delhi High Court in 2011 to dismiss the Bofors case, which was accepted. Quattrocchi died in 2013 of a heart attack.

To Conclude

Despite the controversy, the Bofors gun was used extensively as the primary field artillery. During the Kargil war with Pakistan, it gave India an edge according to battlefield commanders.

The Bofors scandal was a turning point in Indian politics. It was the first major corruption scandal that caught the highest echelons of power in its net. There is nothing that suggests that payments had been received by Rajiv Gandhi. He was, however, guilty of knowing about the kickbacks and not taking action on them.

Though Rajiv Gandhis 5-year tenure is mostly remembered for its big controversies to name a few: Bofors, Unlocking the Babri, Shah Bano ordinance & Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil war, there were several positive steps he took-

Liberalization of economy and easing of restrictions.
He fought Left and the Right to open India to computer imports thus bringing an IT revolution.
He brought telephones from classes to masses by creating Public Calling Offices(PCO).
Lowered voting age from 21 to 18, empowering youth.
Rajiv Gandhi introduced local body elections and formalized Panchayats.
He brought peace to Punjab which had been in turmoil for 10 years by signing Punjab Acord with Akali leaders.
He strengthened India-China relations.

397,"US President Donald Trump is currently on trial in the Senate, having been impeached by the House over Democrat allegations that withholding military aid to Ukraine over corruption concerns amounted to an abuse of power. Former Ukrainian officials and anti-corruption activists, however, have testified that not only was there corruption involving Burisma, the natural gas firm tied to former vice president and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Bidens son, but that it went all the way to the top.

These revelations can be found in the third installment of the documentary series UkraineGate: Inconvenient facts, produced by the French investigative journalist Olivier Berruyer, founder of popular anti-corruption and economics blog Les Crises.

Hunter Biden was hired solely to pressure Ukrainian authorities into stopping the criminal investigations into Burisma, former Deputy Prosecutor-General Renat Kuzmin told Berruyer. These investigations had raised the possibility that Bidens compensation was in effect a bribe being channeled to his father, who handled the Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

When VP Biden demanded the firing of head prosecutor Viktor Shokin  as he later boasted on camera  Poroshenko was happy to oblige, even if he had to bribe some members of the Rada to make it happen, interviewees have revealed.

A leading anti-corruption activist openly accused the former president of keeping the office of prosecutor-general under personal political control. One former deputy prosecutor said that Poroshenko treated the office as an escort service, in his pursuit of money and power.

A former employee of the prosecutor-generals office described Poroshenko as the most corrupt president in our history, as of now.

Former MP Oleksandr Onyschenko testified that Burismas owner Mykola Zlochevsky used him in late 2015 to relay a $50 million bribe offer to Poroshenko to make the investigations go away  and that the president agreed. The former parliamentarian and close associate of Poroshenko has since turned whistleblower, admitting to taking bribes himself in exchange for votes, such as the one to remove Shokin.

Poroshenko lost his re-election bid in 2019 to comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, and is currently reported to be facing multiple criminal investigations for corruption.

Unfortunately, Ukraine is corrupt to the core, said former Deputy Prosecutor Kuzmin, pointing the finger of blame at the US governments involvement with Poroshenkos administration.",am
398,"(Yicai Global) April 3 -- Shares of CAR, China's biggest auto rental company, almost halved in value today in the wake of an unfolding financial scandal at a mega coffee chain controlled by the same man.

CAR's stock price [HKG: 0699] closed 54.4 percent lower in Hong Kong at HKD1.96 (25 US cents), the price at which they changed hands before trading in the shares was halted at 10.14 a.m. local time. That slashed the firm's market capitalization to about HKD4.16 billion (USD536 million). The stock had earlier fallen as much as 72 percent.

The Beijing-based company is controlled by Charles Lu, 51, who is also Luckin Coffee's actual controller, data from business data search platform Tianyancha showed. Often called China's answer to Starbucks, Luckin yesterday issued a statement saying its chief operating officer has been suspended on suspicion of fabricating sales figures by CNY2.2 billion (USD310.4 million). Luckin's shares plunged in New York.

Moreover, Luckin Coffee's Chief Executive Jenny Qian and its COO Liu Jian are former employees of CAR. According to Luckin's website, Liu worked for CAR from 2008 to 2018, serving as the head of revenue management between 2015 and 2018. He joined the coffee chain as COO in May 2018. Qian was COO at CAR.

US-based short seller Geo Investing issued a short report in 2017, questioning CAR's financial calculation methods, related transactions, and orders of its affiliated tailored taxi service unit in the second half of 2016. But the report was not much of a factor in CAR's share price.

Luckin-CAR Nexus

""There was a strong connection between Luckin Coffee and CAR, and the financial fraud caused collateral damage to the latter,"" Cao He, president of a venture capital fund management firm in Beijing, told Yicai Global. ""This thing will involve some personal assets as Luckin Coffee went public in the United States and the US market is more protective of investors.

""Luckin Coffee's asset value may not be enough to compensate investors,"" he added. ""As a result, personal assets of major shareholders will definitely be involved, which will directly affect other firms under the control of the majority shareholder,"" who is Lu.

""In addition, Luckin may also be held accountable in China, and CAR's development will be significantly impacted once the large shareholder's other assets are frozen,"" Cao added.

The incident also had an impact on Chinese carmaker Beiqi Foton Motor. CAR announced in March last year that it had bought a 67 percent stake in vehicle brand Borgward from an enterprise management consultancy based in Xiamen for CNY4.12 billion (USD578.2 million). But the Xiamen firm announced three months ago that it had bought 67 percent shares of Borgward from Foton Motor for CNY3.97 billion.

Lu said at that time the acquisition of Borgward was aimed at building an integrated industrial chain covering vehicle manufacturing, sales, leasing and transport.

It again delayed the deadline to receive the Xiamen firm's remaining principal amount of CNY1.481 billion for buying Borgward's share to the end of this year, Foton Motor said on April 1. Regarding the CNY4.67 billion shareholder loans for Borgward, the carmaker will pay off CNY4 billion with fixed assets, with the deadline to repay the remaining CNY900 million principal and interest extended again.

This means Lu needs to pay off Foton Motor's CNY4.67 billion loans for the carmaker after spending CNY4.109 billion for the controlling stake.

Shares of Foton Motor [SHA: 600166] fell 3.2 percent today to close at CNY1.86 (26 US cents). The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent.",am
399,"Technology baron and cyber security founder John McAfee has been arrested by Spanish police at the behest of the US government, and charged, along with his bodyguard Jimmy Watson Jr, for his role in an alleged cryptocurrency fraud scheme and tax evasion.

In separate indictments unsealed on 5 October 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ), it was claimed that McAfee promoted multiple initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Twitter while pretending to be impartial, but failed to disclose that he was being paid more than $23m in digital assets to do so; failed to file tax returns over a four-year period; and attempted to evade tax liabilities by concealing assets, including real estate and a yacht, in the names of others.

Potential investors in digital asset securities are entitled to know if promoters were compensated by the issuers of those securities, said Kristina Littman, the SECs cyber unit chief.

McAfee, assisted by Watson, allegedly leveraged his fame to deceptively tout numerous digital asset securities to his followers without informing investors of his role as a paid promoter, she said.

The SECs complaint goes on to allege that McAfee made other false statements, including that he had invested in some of the ICOs and was advising some of the issuers.

Watson, meanwhile, supposedly aided in negotiating the promotional deals with the ICO issues and helped McAfee cash out the digital asset payments, for which he was allegedly paid $316,000. He is also said to have had his partner tweet interest in the ICO.

Bona fide investors, the SEC added, were left holding digital assets that have now become essentially worthless.

The pair also stand accused of engaging in a separate scheme to profit from a digital asset security by quietly accumulating a large position in McAfees accounts, touting the security on Twitter while intending to sell it, and then selling the holdings as the price rose.

The charges against McAfee and Watson include violating anti-fraud provisions of the USs federal security laws, while McAfee is charged with violating anti-touting provisions and Watson with aiding and abetting him. The Department of Justices charges relate to tax evasion.

The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions, the return of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. It also hopes to disbar McAfee from serving as a public company officer or director. If convicted under the DoJs charges, he could also face a lengthy spell in prison.

McAfee founded the eponymous cyber security company in 1987 but resigned in 1994. Since then, he has founded several other business ventures, but none as successful as McAfee. He has attracted more attention in recent years for his increasingly erratic behaviour, lavish lifestyle, boasts of tax evasion, and allegations of other criminal activity.

He is now awaiting extradition to the US.",am
400,"A fund in which the Vaticans Secretariat of State has invested tens of millions of euros has links to two Swiss banks investigated or implicated in bribery and money laundering scandals involving more than one billion dollars. The fund is under investigation by Vatican authorities.

The fund, Centurion Global Fund, made headlines this week that it used the Vatican assets under its management to invest in Hollywood films, real estate, and utilities, including investments in movies like Men in Black International and the Elton John biopic Rocketman.

Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported that the Centurion Global Fund has raised around 70 million euro in cash, and that the Holy Sees Secretariat of State is the source of at least two-thirds of the funds assets. The Vaticans investment is reported to include funds from the Peters Pence collection, intended to support charitable works and the ministry of the Vatican Curia.

Centurion registered a loss of some 4.6% in 2018, while at the same time incurring management fees of roughly 2 million euros, raising questions about the prudential use of Vatican resources.

But beyond losses, a CNA investigation has found that Centurion Global Fund is connected to several institutions linked to allegations of money laundering.

Fund prospectus documents state that all Centurion investment funds are held by Lugano-based Banca Zarattini, a small Swiss bank providing private banking, asset management, and fixed income trading services.

Swiss and U.S. media outlets in 2018 reported that Zarattini was named in indictments filed by U.S. prosecutors in a $1 billion money laundering case, involving the Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA and Venezuelas president Nicholas Maduro.

Along with an offshore bank and a New Jersey institution that has faced several investigations for non-compliance with money laundering regulations, Zarrattini was at the time holding funds subject to seizure in the PDVSA money laundering investigation.

Swiss financial news sites also linked the bank to an alleged $62 million bribe paid to a PDVSA official.

Centurion Global Fund shares a corporate office, 259 St. Paul Street in Valetta, Malta, and a single phone number and email address, with a Malta-based investment group, Gamma Capital which is listed as Centurions formal investment manager.

Gamma Capitals founder and owner is Enzo Filippini. Before founding Gamma, Filippini served as head of the treasury department for a now-closed Swiss bank, BSI.

In 2016, Swiss banking authorities effectively shuttered BSI by a forced extinctive merger, after concluding that it had committed serious breaches of the statutory due diligence requirements in relation to money laundering and serious violations of the principles of adequate risk management and appropriate organization.

European brokerage firms like Gamma Capital Trader are required to disclose the institutions through which they execute client trades each year. In 2017, Gamma executed all of its trades through a single bank  Banca Zarattini.

The next year, 2018, Gamma used only two institutions to execute client trades, Zarattini and Sparkasse Bank Malta, which was also involved in the PDVSA money laundering scandal, according to multiple media reports.

The Times of Malta reported that Sparkasse Bank was mentioned in the Panama Papers data leak as the Maltese institution of choice for infamous money-laundering Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

Former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and former Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda watch the annual military parade at Zocalo main square, in Mexico City, Mexico.
(CNN)A former Mexican defense minister was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on drug and money laundering charges, accused of taking bribes in exchange for permitting a cartel known for wholesale violence to operate with impunity in Mexico, federal prosecutors said Friday.
General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Secretary of National Defense in Mexico from 2012 to 2018, has been indicted on four counts, including international heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana manufacture and distribution conspiracy, importation and distribution conspiracies, and conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.
?

One year after being sentenced, 'El Chapo' is hoping an appeal can get him out of Supermax, his lawyer says
Federal prosecutors said Cienfuegos Zepeda allegedly assisted the H-2 cartel, which was previously led by the late Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez, also known as ""H-2,"" and based in Nayarit and Sinaloa, Mexico.
		
""The defendant abused that public position to help the H-2 Cartel, an extremely violent Mexican drug trafficking organization, traffic thousands of kilograms of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States, including New York City,"" federal prosecutors said in a letter supporting a motion for a permanent order of detention against the defendant. ""In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartel -- a cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murder -- to operate with impunity in Mexico.""
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter Thursday night that he was informed of the detention by US Ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau.
The general appeared in federal court Friday and has been ordered to remain in US custody until a formal detention hearing is held for him next Tuesday. Prosecutors will ask for his transfer to New York. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""It is a very regrettable fact that a former defense secretary is detained, accused of drug trafficking,"" Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly known as AMLO, said during his daily press briefing on Friday.
Falko Ernst, a Mexico-based security analyst for the Crisis Group, said the arrest was ""a very stark reminder that the incorruptibility of the armed forces -- the myth that they're somehow protagonists of the 'war on drugs' and simultaneously uncompromised by it -- has little to do with on-the-ground realities.""
?

""It is also a reminder that there is no such thing as a clear line between state and crime, which undermines the very notion that this is a winnable war with clear enemy categories,"" Ernst said via WhatsApp Friday. ""It should thus remind us how badly needed new, and better solutions that go beyond force alone are. The current approach -- ever-greater militarization -- has failed dramatically.""
Cienfuegos Zepeda served as defense minister under President Enrique Peña Nieto, who left office two years ago.
In the letter supporting the motion for a permanent order of detention, federal prosecutors accuse Cienfuegos Zepeda of using his position to ensure that military operations were not conducted against the H-2 cartel, initiate operations against rivals, locate maritime transportation for drug shipments, help expand the territory controlled by the cartel and introduce senior cartel leaders to other corrupt Mexican government officials.
The general also warned the cartel about US law enforcement investigations and informants, prosecutors wrote. In one instance, an H-2 cartel member whom the organization incorrectly believed to be an informant was murdered, according to the letter.
The evidence against the general includes ""thousands of Blackberry Messenger communications"" between him and a senior cartel boss as well as other organization members, according to the letter.
Cienfuegos Zepeda's detention comes less than a year after the US arrest of Mexico's former public security secretary, Genaro Garcia Luna, who held the post from 2006 to 2012.
Garcia Luna, who was arrested by federal agents in Dallas, Texas, last December, was charged in a drug trafficking conspiracy that involved receiving millions of dollars in bribes from imprisoned drug cartel kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to federal prosecutors. Garcia Luna has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
AMLO on Friday defended the armed forces, calling them ""incorruptible"" and ""pillars of the Mexican state"" while blaming former administrations of what he called the ""neoliberal period"" when tens of thousands of Mexicans were killed in drug-related violence and cartel warfare.
In May, AMLO ordered the armed forces to return to the streets in an attempt to reduce violence by primarily targeting organized criminal groups. The move was controversial because he won the presidency on a platform of demilitarizing the country's long-running war against drug cartels.
		
Previous administrations also deployed the military against the cartels. The resulting violence has left hundreds of thousands of dead in Mexico since 2006.

403,"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the New York State Department of Financial Services has filed charges and initiated administrative proceedings against Endo International plc and its subsidiaries, Endo Health Solutions Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. These charges are the second to be filed in DFS' ongoing investigation into the entities that created and perpetuated the opioid crisis.

""All these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were, and they used it as a reckless business model for their own financial gain at the cost of thousands of human lives and billions of dollars. New York demands accountability from the drug companies and others responsible for the opioid epidemic that continues to devastate families and communities throughout the state and across the country,"" Governor Cuomo said.""Their greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable, and New York will make sure that justice is served and these big pharmaceutical companies are ultimately held responsible for their actions.""

According to DFS' Statement of Charges, Endo has been a prolific manufacturer of opioids in the United States, manufacturing approximately 18.4 percent of the opioids that flooded New York from 2006 to 2014. Endo manufactured both its own branded opioids as well as generic opioids.

The DFS' Statement of Charges alleges that, like other opioid manufacturers, Endo:

Knowingly furthered a false narrative to legitimize opioids as appropriate for broad treatment of pain by downplaying their long-known addictive nature and risks. This strategic effort caused a shift in medical providers' and patients' acceptance of opioids as medically legitimate, necessary and appropriate painkillers. As a result, demand soared, as did the predictable negative consequences;
Misrepresented the safety and efficacy of opioids, without legitimate scientific substantiation, in a panoply of materials typically used by the medical community and patients, including marketing and promotional materials, educational publications, and medical literature published by associations and key opinion leaders funded and supported by Endo; and
Deployed a large sales force to target healthcare providers directly with these misrepresentations. Indeed, Endo's representatives made at least 165,000 sales calls just in New York to market its branded opioid, Opana ER, over just a four-year period.

DFS has further alleged that Endo repeatedly marketed a reformulated version of Opana as abuse-resistant without having a legitimate basis for such a claim. The Federal Food and Drug Administration had rejected Endo's request to use such language on product labelling on the ground that ""the data did not show that the reformulation could be expected to meaningfully reduce abuse,"" and Endo's own internal documents showed that the new product remained subject to abuse. Despite that, Endo continued to market the new formulation as safer and less likely to be abused than its older product and comparable generics. In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo remove Reformulated Opana ER from the market due to its high risk of abuse.

According to DFS' Statement of Charges, Endo violated two New York Insurance Laws. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law prohibits fraudulent insurance acts and carries with it penalties of up to $5,000 plus the amount of the fraudulent claim for each violation; DFS alleges that each fraudulent prescription constitutes a separate violation. Section 408 of the Financial Services Law prohibits intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to a financial product or service, which includes health insurance and carries with it penalties of up to $5,000 per violation; once again, DFS alleges that each fraudulent prescription constitutes a separate violation.

The hearing will be held at the office of the New York State Department of Financial Services, One State Street, New York, New York, beginning on October 26, 2020.",am

405,"The former president of a Maryland transportation company was sentenced to four years in federal prison for participating in a scheme to bribe an official at a unit of a Russian nuclear-energy company.
Mark Lambert, 57 years old, was sentenced by a federal judge in Greenbelt, Md., on Wednesday. He also was ordered to serve three years of supervised release and pay a $20,000 fine.
The former Transportation Logistics Inc. executives sentence was handed down nearly a year after he was convicted in November last year of various counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, wire fraud and conspiracy charges.
In sentencing Mr. Lambert, District Judge Theodore Chuang said he had taken into account the executives health condition and risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Lambert suffered a near fatal heart attack in 2014, the judge said.

A lawyer for Mr. Lambert said the judge had acknowledged several mitigating factors presented to the court, including Mr. Lamberts prior military service. The executive is evaluating his options for an appeal, the lawyer, William Sullivan Jr., a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, said.
Mr. Lambert wont be required to report for his prison sentence until February, a measure that the judge said he had applied to others convicted in the district to avoid the risk of infection and limit the impact of the virus on the federal prison system.

Still, he found the substance of Mr. Lamberts crimes were serious enough to warrant a sentence well beyond the sentence of home confinement requested by his legal team.
Its the type of offense that may seem like the cost of doing business, but it does run contrary to the values of our country, Judge Chuang said.
Federal prosecutors had asked the judge to impose a sentence of more than 12 years in prison.
Mr. Lambert participated in a scheme to bribe a Russian official at a subsidiary of Russias State Atomic Energy Corp.the countrys sole supplier and exporter of uraniumto secure business contracts, prosecutors said at trial.
The official, Vadim Mikerin, in 2015 pleaded guilty in the U.S. to conspiring to commit money laundering and was sentenced to four years in prison.
Mr. Lamberts former co-president, Daren Condrey, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud. Mr. Condrey is awaiting sentencing, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

406,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was already the most corrupt cabinet member in the Trump administration. He was party to many shady deals while vice chair of the Bank of Cyprus, and faced multiple lawsuits and SEC fines for his practices with his other business holdings. Like his boss, Ross held on to many of his business interests despite promising to divest, and a Forbes investigation found that his calendar has been studded with meetings with companies tied to his own portfoliofrom Boeing and Ford to international firms, including questionable interests in Russia and China. After Democrats took back the House last year, Bloomberg columnist Joe Nocera suggested that Ross should be high on their list of Trump toadies to be investigated. On top of all that business sleaze, hes also been caught lying under oath, to courts and to Congress, about the purpose behind his agencys failed attempt to add a citizenship question to the census (hint: It was racism).

All of that came before Monday, when we learned from The New York Times that Ross threatened to fire top employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if they did not back up Trumps claim that Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama, when in fact was not. Birminghams National Weather Service officials were forced to issue a statement reassuring Alabamians that the storm was not coming their way, after fielding calls from people worried they that should evacuate. That prompted Trump to continue to insist he had been right about his Alabama claim, even using a Sharpie to ridiculously alter a Weather Service map to falsely show the state within the storms potential path.

Much of the media treated Sharpiegate, as it was frivolously termed, as another zany Trump battle with the truth, but it was on its own an abuse of power. Then it got worse. According to the Times, Ross phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Dr. Jacobs to fix the agencys perceived contradiction of the president. After Rosss pressure, NOAA released an unsigned statement claiming Trump had in fact been given information that Alabama was a possible Dorian target, and specifically chiding Birmingham weather officials for correcting the president using absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time. Huh?

Sharpiegate was never just another silly Trump story. It was always about his authoritarian approach to power, and his willingness to sacrifice public safety to his own vanity. Obviously, people rely on National Weather Service reports to decide whether to stay or to evacuate during a major storm. But Rosss involvement makes the story one layer more corrupt.

Hes commerce secretary: Imagine the commerce implications of bad advice from NOAA and the National Weather Service, as businesses tried to prepare for what was for a while a Category 5 hurricane. This wasnt just another ugly episode of Trump-ass-kissing but a serious subversion of Rosss own responsibilities. Ross is someone with the power and fortune to walk away from this job, rather than shame himself this way, but clearly this level of corruption doesnt bother him.

The Commerce Departments inspector general is now examining the Times  charge. Clearly, if its true, and theres no reason to believe it isnt, Ross should resign, and if he doesnt resign, he should be impeached. So far, a few members of Congress have called on Ross to resign, but that would require Trump to force him. Congress has its own powers, and it should use them to get to the bottom of what Ross did immediately.

In the two weeks since I wrote this piece about the increasing brazenness of Trumps corruption, after he suggested that his failing Doral resort should host the next G-7 meeting, weve seen Vice President Mike Pence stay at his bosss Doonbeg resort in Ireland (though it was remote from Pences planned meetings) and learned that the Air Force is diverting flights to a fueling station near Trumps Turnberry project in Scotland, and that military personnel have stayed occasionally at the money-losing golf resort. (Trump claims, unbelievably, that he had nothing to do with either move.) Now comes this obvious abuse of power by the commerce secretary, clearly to appease his boss.

As I wrote then, Trumps corruption appears to be accelerating, and its hard not to think it has something to do with House Democrats internal divisions over how seriously to take their oversight responsibility. Recently, there has been an uptick in members proposing that corruption might be as serious a basis for impeachment as obstruction of justice allegations. People understand what it means for the president to be spending millions of dollars in federal government tax dollars at his own business properties, Representative Jamie Raskin told Politico.

People do. Does the Democratic leadership? Well find out. Meanwhile, Rosss latest moves should factor into any Trump corruption investigationand should trigger an impeachment inquiry for the commerce secretary, too.",am
407,"The U.S. said it seized millions of dollars in cryptocurrency assets and a fake website purporting to sell protective gear in an operation targeting the financial underpinnings of three terrorist groups.

The coordinated law-enforcement action targets the donation networks of al Qaeda and the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamass military wing, as well as a scheme to sell N95 respirator masks to U.S. health-care providers by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, the U.S. Justice Department said.

The action comes as the U.S. Treasury Department and other federal agencies consider new regulations for the cryptocurrency industry meant to counter terror financing and money laundering and that could mean exchanges and other companies would face steep fines if their platforms are used for illicit finance.

The Justice Department on Thursday unsealed three civil asset-forfeiture complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which officials said represented the seizure of about 300 cryptocurrency wallets holding about $2 million in assets. Authorities also blacklisted several millions of dollars in other virtual currency assets identified in the investigation that werent immediately obtainable, officials said.

One unsealed complaint targets the website FaceMaskCenter.com, which officials said was part of a scheme by an ISIS facilitator to sell fake N95 masks to customers across the globe, including to a customer in the U.S. who sought to purchase the masks and other protective gear for hospitals, nursing homes and fire departments.

Federal prosecutors said they also seized four Facebook pages and four websites used to facilitate the various schemes. Facebook didnt immediately return a request for comment.

The operation, the largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations cryptocurrency accounts, officials said, shows the extent to which terrorist groups have come to rely on cybertools such as virtual currencies to solicit donations to fund their operations.

These terrorist organizations are no differentapart from their ideologyfrom other organizations whose main goal is profit, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Matthew Albence said Thursday during a conference call with reporters. Anytime there is a new avenue they can exploit to move money or make money through their criminal enterprises, they are going to utilize it.

The operation was a coordinated effort by the U.S. attorneys office in Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security, officials said.

It was sparked in part by public social-media posts by the terrorist groups, they said. In one instance cited by federal prosecutors, a Twitter account identifying itself as the official account of the al-Qassam Brigades asked supporters to Donate for Palestinian Resistance via Bitcoin. The group claimed the donations were untraceable.

The Justice Department on Thursday unsealed a criminal complaint against two Turkish nationals whom it said acted as money launderers in the Al-Qassam Brigades scheme by operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.

Officials also said they are investigating a number of people, including some in the U.S., who donated to the social-media campaigns.

The case could help justify a push by the U.S. Treasury Department and other agencies for tougher regulation of the cryptocurrency sector, including rules meant to counter anonymity and require exchanges and other firms to shoulder the same know-your-customer requirements as the banking industry.

The assets targeted in the complaints unsealed Thursday were seized from numerous virtual currency exchanges. The exchanges cooperated with the U.S. government investigation, officials said.",am
408,"venezuelanalysis.com)  Venezuelas attorney general, Tarek William Saab, has opened an investigation into former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez in relation to a billion-dollar embezzlement scheme in state oil company PDVSA.

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Saab said that the probe had been launched after evidence was found in a raid on businessman Diego Salazars office, allegedly linking Ramirez to the scam. Salazar is Ramirezs first cousin and was arrested on money-laundering and embezzlement charges at the beginning of December.

According to Saab, authorities had discovered a document where Diego Salazar names him [Ramirez] directly, directly incriminates him as his direct business partner in intermediary operations of the purchase and the sale of oil.

This leads the Attorney Generals office to open up an investigation case, to develop a line of judicial action that leads us to determining what responsibility this citizen might have in these cases, he continued.

Ramirez was one of the longest serving ministers under the government of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias, serving as oil minister between 2002-2014 and president of PDVSA from 2004 to 2014. He also acted as Venezuelas ambassador to the United Nations until last week, when he was asked to resign by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He is currently thought to be outside of the country, though his exact whereabouts are unknown.

Since taking over from former Attorney General Luisa Ortega in August, Saabs office has arrested 67 upper and mid-level managers in state oil company PDVSA and its subordinate companies, including its principal US subsidiary, CITGO.

The arrests were all in relation to a string of corruption, graft and false-contracting rackets discovered to have taken place in PDVSA over the last ten years, which Saab says has cost the public purse billions of dollars. Nearly all of the crimes were carried out under Ramirez tenure as Venezuelas chief oil policy-maker. Two former ministers and PDVSA presidents, Euologio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez, were also arrested two weeks ago.

Both Salazar and Ramirez are accused of participating in the Andorra Bank scandal, in which up to EUR4.2 billion in state oil dollars are thought to have been embezzled since 2006. Approximately forty PDVSA employees and businesspeople are alleged to have been involved in the scheme, with the stolen funds moved out of the country via the private Andorra Bank. Ramirez has denied the accusations of corruption against him, while Reuters reported that he said the government would be making one of its worst political moves if prosecutors pursued investigations against him.

Panama Papers and CENCOEX

In further comments to press, Saab also lambasted his predecessor Luisa Ortega for having closed several corruption cases in spite of evidence, revealing his office would now re-open a number of state corruption investigations in relation to the Panama Papers.

Former state officials such as Venezuelan Army Chief Víctor Cruz Weffer, former Miraflores head of security Adrián Velásquez, ex-PDVSA Vice-President for Finance Eudomario Carruyo, and the former director of Venezuelas Development Fund and the National Treasury, Claudia Patricia Diaz, will all be subject to a renewed investigation.

The attorney general also disclosed that his office was investigating at least 120 companies and shell companies in relation to importer fraud and the misuse of subsidized dollars obtained from Venezuelan state foreign commerce bureau CONCOEX. Twenty-one arrests have already been made since August.

Meanwhile, an investigation into Zulia-based First Justice politician Juan Guanipa will also be re-opened, Saab announced. Guanipa is accused of fomenting violent protests and utilizing hate-speech between April and July this year, when at least 120 people were killed as a result of deadly anti-government unrest in the country.",am
409,"This Is Still Happening is a new feature in which Slate will attempt to offer an update on Cabinet-level corruption, what could be done to bring the officials to account, and what Democrats are doing in response (generally, nothing). The second installment is about a figure who has been at the center of many Trump-era scandals, Steven Mnuchin.

The Official: Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin

What Is Still Happening: Mnuchin has been implicated in many, many, many scandals  big, medium, and small since President Donald Trump first nominated the former Goldman Sachs chief information officer, hedge fund manager, foreclosure specialist, and film executive to be secretary of the treasury. He has been most recently in the news not for any of that early-term malfeasance, but for his current and ongoing efforts to cover up Trumps tax returns.

In April, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal issued a formal request to the Internal Revenue Service for Trumps tax returns under a 1924 update to the tax code, which commanded that upon written request from the chairmen of the relevant committees, the Treasury Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request. Mnuchin, fulfilling an earlier promise to defy any such request, responded in May that he would not be furnishing the tax returns as the statute obligated. This came after Mnuchin acknowledged that his department had communicated with the White House about how it should handle the issue. As the Washington Post noted, the tax request process is designed to be walled off from White House interference, in part because of corruption that took place during the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. Oh, well!

In his response to Neal, Mnuchin argued that he could ignore both the spirit and the letter of the law, making an unsupported claim that the request for tax information lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. Even though the law says that the Secretary shall furnish the requested tax information, no questions asked, Neal had offered a legitimate legislative purpose for the request, namely to ensure that IRS policies subjecting presidential tax returns to mandatory examinations were being carried out properly. That legislative purpose only grew more urgent this past July when, according to a letter Neal sent Mnuchin in August, a federal whistleblower presented the committee with credible allegations of evidence of possible misconductspecifically, potential inappropriate efforts to influence the mandatory [presidential and vice presidential] audit program. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that the whistleblower was an IRS official who reported that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to interfere in the mandatory audit of the presidents or vice presidents returns.
Mnuchins refusal to turn over requested tax returns in direct violation of the law should clearly be a really big deal! Besides Neals stated legislative purpose, there are open questions about whether foreign-backed lenders provided financing to Trump at a time when the self-declared bankruptcy king struggled to entice other lenders, and the returns could clarify to what extent foreign actors might have financial leverage over the president. Further, because he failed to divest from his businesses, a tax return could illuminate how much money Trump continues to receive from foreign governments potentially seeking to curry his favor in direct violation of the Constitutions foreign emoluments clause. The returns could also help Congress find out if the president cheated on his taxes. Finally, all of this could be part of a case for impeachment.

But it would be unfair to Mnuchin to focus strictly on his misconduct as an appendage of the presidents misconduct. The treasury secretary has done plenty of sketchy to unlawful things on his own, in apparent service of his own interests. Whether helping himself or his boss, hes accumulated a remarkable list of grifting accomplishments:

 Before Mnuchins confirmation he acknowledged that he had failed to disclose to the Senate Finance Committee nearly $100 million in assets, as well as his role as a director of an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a notorious tax shelter.

 As part of that confirmation process, Mnuchin lied to Congress: He denied that under his management, OneWest Bankan institution that specialized in foreclosures in the aftermath of the financial crisishad participated in the practice of robo-signing foreclosure documents without doing the necessary diligence. Contrary to Mnuchins Senate testimony, a former vice president of OneWest testified in court that she signed 750 foreclosure documents a week without reviewing many of them; that she took 30 seconds per document; and that she had changed my signature considerably to accommodate her OneWest signing practices, adding that its just an E now. Its worth noting that shortly after Mnuchin entered office, the bank offered $89 million to settle claims that it had abused the foreclosure process. Just one example of that abuse involved the firms attempts to foreclose on the home of a 90-year-old woman who had made a 27-cent payment error. Mnuchin and his fellow investors, for their parts, made $1.6 billion in the 2009 deal to take over the failed bank that would become OneWest, and Mnuchin personally took a $10.9 million payout after OneWest merged with a different bank in 2015.

 Mnuchin was chastised in early 2017 by career ethics officials for violating laws against self-dealing when he promoted The Lego Batman Movie, which was financed by his production company.

 Earlier this year, that same federal ethics watchdog agency refused to certify Mnuchins 2018 financial disclosure after it learned that he had sold his stake in a film production business to his then-fiancée and current wife, Louise Linton. This sale came after Mnuchin signed an ethics agreement promising to divest from the company.

 Linton was a key player in a separate scandal involving the secretary. In 2017, she posted Instagram photos of herself disembarking from a military plane in Kentucky just prior to a solar eclipse, including the hashtags for high-end fashion brands that she was wearing at the time. When a mother of three from Portland, Oregon, posted a comment on Lintons Instagram page expressing dismay over the fact that taxpayers had funded what seemed like a personal glamour trip, Linton responded:

Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? Im pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day trip than you did.

What great #patriotism!

Lintons question about government-funded honeymoon travel was more than rhetorical: It was later reported that Mnuchin had requested use of a government jet for himself and Linton to travel on their 2017 European honeymoon, but the request had been denied. It was also later reported that between the spring and fall of 2017, Mnuchin had taken eight trips on military aircraft, costing taxpayers $1 million, when he could have flown commercial airlines as had been the practice of his predecessors, and with his wife as his regular flight companion. (Linton recently joked about having been described as the Marie Antoinette, Darth Vader, and Cruella de Vil of the Trump administration entourage.)

 Mnuchin managed to entangle himself in perhaps the most convoluted scandal of the Trump presidency: the Russia affair. As lawmakers left town for the winter holidays last year, Mnuchin announced a decision to undo sanctions against Oleg Deripaska, a Vladimir Putinaligned Russian oligarch at the center of the Mueller investigation. Special counsel Robert Mueller would find that Deripaska had been promised private briefings and had likely been provided Trump internal polling data by former Trump campaign chairman and current federal prison inmate Paul Manafort. But Mnuchin determined that congressionally approved sanctions against Deripaska should be significantly lessened. Mnuchin also reportedly misled Congress about the terms of the deal the Treasury Department struck with Deripaska to cut those sanctions. Mnuchin also failed to address his own conflict of interest revolving around a direct business connection to a top shareholder at Deripaskas firm. No collusion, though!

 Mnuchin was accused of using his Jewish identity to help shield the president after Trump said there were  very fine people  among the attendees of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that included participants who wielded flaming torches and chanted neo-Nazi slogans.

 Mnuchin postponed the Treasury Departments previously announced move to put abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, reportedly because he understood the change would upset the president, who is a big fan of the current face of the $20 bill, virulent racist Andrew Jackson.

How Long It Has Been Going On: Mnuchins abuse of corporate positions of power stretches back at least a decade, as evidenced by the validated charges of foreclosure misconduct against OneWest. He extended his corruption to the public sector the moment he set out to enter government service in late 2016, through his lies and withholding of information during his confirmation process, and began abusing his office in the first months after hed obtained it. His latest efforts to cover up Trumps tax returns can be dated at least back to March, when he promised that he would protect the president before the request for Trumps returns had even been made.

What Would Normally Happen: Normally, the president would just hand over his tax returns, as every previous modern candidate had done prior to Trump. Because theres no precedent for what Trump has done, its hard to think of a parallel case and a normal response. After the Teapot Dome scandal, Congress tried to solve the problem of the executive branch preventing congressional financial investigations and blocking access to tax returnsin that case, it had been Mnuchin predecessor at the Treasury Department Andrew Mellon who had come under scrutinyby passing the law saying that the secretary shall furnish requested returns. But Mnuchin is simply ignoring that law.

As for Mnuchins various conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and ethics lapses, thats also a highly unusual situation. Theres no real enforcement mechanism on those issues aside from impeachment. As the Times noted of the failure to get his 2018 disclosure certified following the revelations that he had attempted to divest one of his investments by selling it to Linton:

It is extremely rare for cabinet officials to not have their financial records certified, said Virginia Canter, a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department. In 2001, Paul H. ONeill, President George W. Bushs Treasury secretary, divested his holdings in Alcoa, an aluminum producer, because of conflicts of interest.

Of course, all of this is nothing compared with the presidents own failure to divest from his businesses, which is perhaps why Mnuchins conflicts might not matter so much to the public.

In regard to the apparent abuses of government resources surrounding the $1 million in noncommercial travel, there is some very recent precedent there. Trumps first health and human services secretary, Tom Price, was forced to resign that job for spending $400,000 on private planes for official business travel. Apparently, though, the norm that abuses of government resources might result in removal from office or resignation only applied to the first couple of Trump Cabinet officials who were caught doing that.

What Democrats Have Done: Issued stern verbal warnings, sent out subpoenas, and gone to court. None of these efforts have accomplished anything so far. Given the breadth and scope of Mnuchins abuses, the Democratic timidity in confronting him seems particularly pathetic.

That timidity is not relegated just to the House of Representatives. Shortly after she entered federal office, Sen. Kamala Harris of California struggled to explain why she had failed to prosecute OneWest Banks foreclosure violations as California attorney general back in 2013.

Senate Democrats, meanwhile, tried to vote to overturn the Deripaska sanctions relief with the support of many Republicans, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked that effort. Sen. Ron Wyden, for his part, has been harshly critical of Mnuchins various past abusive business practices and more recent violations of federal ethics statutes, but nobody has actually done anything about either of those issues.

As for the tax returns, Neal has taken a route that even many of his colleagues in the generally sheepish Democratic caucus have found to be meek. In May, after Mnuchin refused to hand over Trumps tax returns as required by law, Neal escalated by issuing a subpoena. A week later, when Mnuchin said he would not be complying with the subpoena, Neal decided not to seek to hold him in contempt of Congress, but instead simply went to court. I dont see what good it would do at this particular time, Neal told CNN, when asked about contempt. I think that if both sides have made up their minds, better to move it over to the next branch of government, the judiciary.
The case landed in front of Trump-appointed D.C. District Judge Trevor McFadden, and when Neal requested that the case be fast-tracked because of the urgency of the matter, McFadden said no.

Meanwhile, Neal said earlier this month that he hadnt determined yet whether to even release the whistleblower complaint about the alleged abuse of the audit system to the public. He also couldnt say whether an allegation of political interference in the audit process, on top of the total nullification of the law requiring tax records be turned over to his committee, on top of Mnuchin ignoring congressional subpoenas, deserved being drawn into the Democrats newly launched impeachment inquiry.

Thats hard to speculate about, Neal said. I think that certainly you believe as we go down this road, that the inquiry could entail a lot of different things. You can see, Im very guarded about what I have to say because this is an active court case. Fellow lawmakers are apparently growing impatient with Neals handling of the whistleblower complaint, with one telling the Post that Neal had been almost entirely silent about the whole matter in private meetings with Democrats on his committee.

Great work, Richard Neal!

What Is Likely to Be Done: As with the Ukraine scandal, Democrats could play their one big card and initiate impeachment proceedings against Mnuchin. They could also consider exercising their long-dormant inherent contempt powers, perhaps in new ways such as issuing fines, though such fines might be impossible to enforce and also would likely be a drop in the bucket to Mnuchin. It seems unlikely that they will do either of these things. You would think that Trumps tax returns would be a critical part of any impeachment inquiry, but so far theyre not critical enough for the Democrats to really fight for them.

One thing Democrats mightand shoulddo about Mnuchin is this: make sure he at least answers for whatever his role might have been in the Ukraine scandal. Mnuchin has said repeatedly that he wasnt on the call on which Trump pressured Ukraines president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden (Mnuchin argued against releasing the summary of that call and claimed publicly it was largely a congratulatory call before that release showed otherwise). He has, however, said that he was involved in the process of blocking $250 million in military aid to Ukraine while Trumps pressure campaign was happening. Mnuchin has further claimed there was no connection between the military aid being withheld and the pressure campaign to investigate Biden.

If House Democrats have any sense, theyll subpoena the treasury secretary for documents related to his work on the aid issue and seek to compel him to testify on the things he has already discussed publicly. Do they have any sense? Well see!",nam

411,"Airbus, Europes largest aerospace multinational, is to pay a record £3bn in penalties after admitting it had paid huge bribes on an endemic basis to land contracts in 20 countries.

Anti-corruption investigators hailed the result as the largest ever corporate fine for bribery in the world after judges declared that the corruption was grave, pervasive and pernicious.

The planemaker agreed to pay the penalties on Friday after reaching settlements with investigators in the UK, France and the US to end inquiries that started four years ago.

In the high court in London, Dame Victoria Sharp, the President of the Queens Bench Division, approved the settlement struck with the UKs Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

She said: The seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly needs to be spelled out. As is acknowledged on all sides, it was grave.

She added that the scale of the wrongdoing demonstrated that bribery was endemic in two core business areas within Airbus.

Allison Clare, for the SFO, told the court the company had paid bribes in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana between 2011 and 2015.

Airbus, which admitted five counts of failing to prevent bribery, had used a network of secret agents to pay large-scale backhanders to officials in foreign countries to land high-value contracts.

This was run by a unit at its French headquarters, which its one-time chief executive Tom Enders reportedly called bullshit castle.

French prosecutors examined bribes to other countries including China, Japan, Russia, Kuwait, Brazil and Turkey.

Hugo Keith, for Airbus, said the settlement will draw a line under the investigation and the grave historical practices exposed by prosecutors.

Airbus hopes the settlements, approved by courts in the three countries, will end turbulence within its management which had led to scores of senior executives being sacked. The firm is one of the largest employers in the UK, with a workforce of 13,500.

The penalties will be paid to the governments of the three countries that investigated Airbus, with £1.7bn going to France and £820m going to the UK Treasury.

The settlement surpasses the previous UK record for a corporate fine for bribery  the £671m paid by Rolls-Royce, Britains leading multinational manufacturer, in 2017.

Under the deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Airbus will pay the penalties and promise to mend its ways. In return, any prosecution of the firm as a corporation will be suspended for three years.

Clare told the court the SFO was still considering whether to prosecute individuals involved in the bribery.

Sue Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said:Airbuss egregious bribery around the world has rightly attracted the largest corporate fine for bribery in history. But this fine will ring extremely hollow if prosecutions of those responsible from Airbus senior management at the time of the wrongdoing do not follow.

The SFO started its investigation in 2016 after evidence emerged of irregularities involving Airbuss secret agents. The French and American investigations started later.

The US settlement was approved in Washington by District Judge Thomas Hogan, who said: It was a pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme in various divisions of Airbus SE that went on for a number of years.

Airbus also admitted violations of US export controls.

However, Fridays deal left unanswered the fate of the SFOs investigation into Airbuss UK-based subsidiary, GPT Special Project Management, which allegedly paid bribes of at least £14m to win Saudi Arabian contracts.

The British government has taken at least 18 months to decide whether to approve the SFOs request to start prosecutions over the GPT allegations.

In another aspect of the alleged corruption, Airbus started an internal investigation in 2017 after the Guardian uncovered .",am
412,"Dominic Chappell has been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

The 53-year-old spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on luxury items, including a yacht, a holiday to the Bahamas, a Bentley car and some Beretta guns, instead of paying £600,000 due in tax.

A former bankrupt and former racing driver with no retail experience, Chappell bought department store chain BHS from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for £1 in March 2015.

But just a year into his ownership, the chain collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pensions black hole.

Chappell, from Blandford Forum in Dorset, was convicted of dishonestly evading his liability to pay more than £500,000 in income tax, corporation tax and VAT between January 2014 and September 2016.

In sentencing, the judge, Mr Justice Bryan, said Chappell had engaged in a long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue.
Bryan told the disgraced businessman: You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies.

Chappell had denied three charges of cheating the public revenue, relating to his bankrupt finance company Swiss Rock Limited (SRL), but was found guilty by a jury at Londons Southwark crown court after three days of deliberation.

His lawyers had claimed he became, and remains, utterly broke as a result of the BHS deal, because the department store chains pension problem exploded shortly after his controversial purchase of the retailer.

In his defence, Chappells lawyers said the businessman would have been able to pay his taxes if BHS had not failed.

The jury heard that Chappell was simply too busy to properly sort out his business dealings, that he was not an accountant and had been let down by others.
During the trial, Chappell told the court that his decision to buy BHS was a life-changing catastrophe and he should never have touched it with a barge poll.

In January, Chappell was ordered to pay £9.5m into the BHS pension schemes after he failed in his appeal against a ruling by the Pensions Regulator, which also secured a £363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the schemes.

413,"PANAMA CITY.- The Financial Pacific case has become one of the industry's most tangled financial scandals. What began as a report of embezzlement on the part of the then managers of the brokerage house uncovered a series of irregularities.

The finding came from statements by an employee of the brokerage house whom they blamed for embezzling $ 12 million.

This woman's words to the Thirteenth Prosecutor's Office took the lid off a Pandoras Box that kept the links of power, corruption, possible money laundering and other crimes that are now a matter of investigation in Panama and by US and Canadian agencies.

A series of facts denounced the interference of the Executive in the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to avoid the knowledge of, among other things, the movements of an account through which shares of the miner Petaquilla Minerals Ltd were traded. The branch also paralyzed the investigations to be carried out by the regulator, the SMV, to the stock exchange.

The investigations are directed towards those responsible for financial strategies that, in violation of the Exchange Act, took in their favor, unpunished, the way to launder millions of dollars, as the research points out.

Some keys

The First Anti-Corruption Prosecutors Office forwarded to the Thirteenth Criminal Court the prosecutor's sight of the investigation for alleged peculation in the $ 7 million loan granted by the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros, CA) to the company HPC Contratas for the construction of the Amador Convention Center (Centro de Convenciones de Amador).

The judicial sources of the Public Ministry informed that this one was sent with a mixed auto; that is, appeal to trial for some investigated and dismissal for others.

In this case, the former president of the CA, Jason Pastor, the former president of the board of the AC, Riccardo Francolini, and 18 other people are accused.

According to the sources, the decision of the prosecutor is given after Judge Alina Hubiedo determined that the investigation phase ended last October.

Attorney Carlos Carrillo, Francolini's defense, said that they had not yet been able to access the prosecutors sight.

""It is clear that in this case there is no crime. Accused my client was accused of irregularities in the loan, but we have shown that all of that is a lie.""

He added that after the orchestrated arrest against his client, a number of former directors were tortured.

""The arrest of my defendant is unjustifiable,"" he said.

Now the court must set the date for a preliminary hearing in the case.

Investigation. Prosecutors' inquiries revealed that part of the loan went to Financial Pacific (FP).

The controversy behind a loan

Former Vice President Felipe Virzi is the second person who linked former President Ricardo Martinelli in the investigations carried out by the First Anti-Corruption Prosecutor for the $ 7 million loan granted by the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros, CA) to finance the failed construction of the Centro de Convenciones de Amador, in 2012.

In a statement filed at his home, Virzi told prosecutor Tania Sterling how the $ 7 million transaction from the Summer Venture Inc. account was given to the brokerage house Financial Pacific (FP).

Virzi appears, along with entrepreneur Ricardo Calvo, as signer of the company Summer Venture Inc., and the CA, with Riccardo Francolini as its president, he deposited the $ 7 million loan that would be to finance the Amador project.

The businessman explained to the prosecutor that about four years ago, the former governor, along with businessman Cristóbal 'Tobin' Salerno, showed up at his home and personally he (Martinelli), asked him to lend $ 7 million to former directors of Financial Pacific Ivan Clare and West Valdés since they were not economically well.

The prosecutor's investigations indicate that this money would have been transferred to cover the $ 12 million gap that had the finances of this brokerage house ??after a millionaire embezzlement.

The board of directors headed by Francolini was formed by Ricardo Chanis, Ricardo Arango, Anastasio Ruiz and Fernando Correa Jolly, Jayson Pastor and former deputy Rodrigo Arosemena Pino acted as general manager of CA.

Virzi also said he did not agree to participate in the construction of the project, but he finally participated. He said that those who had to manage the loan with the CA were the entrepreneurs Claudio Poma, Tobias Garrido and Mauricio Ortiz, representing the company HPC Contracts P&V, of which he is a partner.

In this case, the prosecution charged him with the alleged crime against the public administration in different forms of embezzlement.

The case now

The Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) confirmed that it requested the Interpol Police (Interpol) to activate a red alert to secure the arrest of West Valdés and Iván Clare, former directors of the brokerage house Financial Pacific and businessman Ricardo Calvo.

The former directors of the brokerage house and the businessman face charges against the public administration, in its modality of embezzlement, for the diversion of $ 9 million granted by the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros, CA) to the consortium HPC-Contratas-PV for the construction of the Amateur Center Of Conventions (Centro de Convenciones de Amador).

On November 7, 2016, the First Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, in charge of Tania Sterling, ordered the conduction and appeal to the former directors of the brokerage house.

""It has been possible to establish a red alert for the Interpol authorities ... since there is information that those named are not within the territory of the Republic of Panama,"" said Rolando Rodríguez, general secretary of the Attorney General's Office of the Nation.

""It was necessary to turn the red alert against these people in the process and definitely for the criminal type that we mentioned, by virtue of what is established as criminal responsibility and participation,"" said Rodríguez.",am
414,"The Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós have claimed they face financial ruin or even jail following an unjust and draconian second prosecution for tax evasion.

The band said the looming second court trial had caused them to lose faith in their country. One member of the band has already left Iceland and three others said they were so disheartened by the situation that they might also leave.

The band members have admitted they evaded 151m Icelandic krona (£840,000) in taxes between 2011 and 2014. They have pleaded guilty, apologised and paid back the money, plus fines and interest. The band claim they were unaware of the tax evasion and blame their accountant.

However, they face a second trial at a separate Icelandic court. The band, which now includes just two of the original members, claim that the second trial is a breach of European convention on human rights rules on double jeopardy. They say the second court is likely to impose an additional fine of at least 200% of the tax evaded. Some of the bands former members say they would not have the funds to pay and would find themselves jailed.

Georg Goggi Holm, the bassist, said the band was ashamed of the tax evasion, even though they were not aware of it at the time. We are not denying that we did something wrong, Holm said. We went out of our way to fix it, find out what happened and pay the money back. But now we are being taken to court for the same thing again. We are not above any law in Iceland, but the law is not correct. And we are speaking out because we have a platform to speak out.

Holm said he was considering leaving Iceland because of the dispute. Kjartan Kjarri Sveinsson, the keyboard player who left the band in 2013, and Orri Páll Dýrason, the bands former drummer, also said they were weighing up leaving their home country.

Jónsi Birgisson, the bands frontman, who has already left Iceland for Los Angeles, said: We have spent years promoting the country; now theyre treating us like criminals.

Holm said the tax evasion was the fault of the bands accountant Gunnar Ásgeirsson, who worked for PwC. We are musicians, we hired the people who we thought were the best in the world. And he failed us, Holm said.

Ásgeirsson has since left PwC. PwC declined to comment or provide contact details for Ásgeirsson.

A spokesman for the Icelandic government said: We do not offer comment on active legal cases and will therefore not provide further comment on the Sigur Rós band legal case.",am
415,"New Delhi: The Hong Kong central bank today penalised State Bank of India's Hong Kong branch $1 million (Hong Kong dollar 7.5 million) for alleged violation of local anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing laws.

In its first action since the Hong Kong's Anti Money-Laundering Ordinance came into force in 2012, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the SBI branch between April 2012 and November 2013 failed to carry out customer due diligence before establishing business relationships.

The branch also failed to monitor business relationships with its customers and verify whether its customers were politically exposed persons, the HKMA said in a statement.

The HKMA ""reprimanded"" SBI's Hong Kong branch for the contraventions and ordered it to submit a report by an independent external advisor on sufficiency of remedial plan and effectiveness of its implementation.

This is the first action by the HKMA under Hong Kong's Anti Money-Laundering Ordinance, which came into force in 2012.

Meena Datwani, Director-General (Enforcement) of the HKMA, said, ""This was a case of internal control failures"" relating to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) rules. The HKMA takes such failures seriously and wants to send a clear message to the industry that all authorised institutions should have effective AML/CFT systems.""

While SBI Hong Kong (SBIHK) said, ""As a member of the Hong Kong banking community for over 35 years, SBIHK is committed to a policy of zero tolerance of non-compliance with regulatory guidelines supported by a robust compliance and risk function, while providing the products and services to our esteemed customers. We fully support the HKMA's efforts to ensure high standards of due diligence and monitoring among Hong Kongs financial institutions.""

It said ""neither the HKMA nor the external consultants found any instances of problem accounts or suspicious transactions during the period in question, or the years following.""

""As noted by the HKMA, we have undertaken very positive and intensive remediation work to address their findings, which refer to procedures and policies in place during 2012 and 2013,"" it said in an emailed statement.

These controls help detect and report suspicious transactions based on their knowledge of their customers, Datwani said.

""These are fundamental to combating money laundering and terrorist financing and thereby maintaining the integrity of the banking system and the reputation of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA will take appropriate enforcement action to deter any lapses in this regard,"" Director-General (Enforcement) of the HKMA said.

According to the SBIHK statement, in determining the disciplinary action, the HKMA took into account the fact that ""SBIHK has taken very positive and intensive remediation work to address the contraventions"" as well as ""confirmed through an external consultant that neither actual problem accounts nor suspicious transactions have been identified.""

""SBIHK has no previous disciplinary record and co-operated with the HKMA during the investigation,"" it added.

The HKMA was given powers in 2012 to supervise banks' compliance with Hong Kong's anti-money laundering law, introduced in the same year.

State Bank of India, Hong Kong Branch (SBIHK) has been ordered ""to submit to the HKMA... a report prepared by an independent external advisor assessing whether the remedial plan of SBIHK is sufficient to address the contraventions found and the effectiveness of the implementation of the remedial plan"", as per the the Hong Kong Monetary Authority statement.

Besides the SBI branch has been ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty of 7,500,000 Hong Kong dollars, it said.

""The action follows the HKMA's investigation which was conducted to ascertain whether SBIHK had proper internal controls in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) systems,"" the HKMA statement added.

HKMA said its investigation found that between April 2012 and November 2013, SBIHK contravened four specified provisions.

416,"At one time, everyone knew where to find Ghislaine Maxwell. The former aide-de-camp of the disgraced, now deceased, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was a fixture in Manhattans most fashionable salons. With an impressive list of contacts, including Prince Andrew and Chelsea Clinton, she was a regular at fundraisers, book launches and society weddings.

The last place anyone would have expected to see her was a Los Angeles shopping mall, where the 57-year-old was photographed in a burger joint last week, just days after Epsteins suicide in a New York jail, where he was being held on charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

Amid some speculation as to whether the photograph may have been staged, and with mystery still surrounding her whereabouts, one thing is undeniable: for the second time, Ghislaines life has been turned upside down by the death of a controversial and powerful man.

It is almost 30 years since her father, the press baron Robert Maxwell, fell to his death from his £15m yacht, Lady Ghislaine, off the Canary Islands, aged 68. Even now there is talk of suicide, or murder  perhaps by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.

He was a man who could not face the ignominy of jail, of being shown to be a liar and a thief. And he very much knew that was coming, says Roy Greenslade, a former editor of one of Maxwells newspapers, the Daily Mirror. So I am a suicide theorist. I believe Maxwell threw himself off.

But Ken Lennox, then the Mirrors senior photographer, who saw the publishers naked corpse shortly after it was pulled from the sea, is convinced: it was an accident.

He used to get up at night and pee over the stern of the ship. Everybody knew this. And he weighed about 22 stone [140kg] at this time. The railings were wire. So I think he lost his balance, because he was very top-heavy, Lennox says. He was Teflon man. I dont think he committed suicide.

Bombastic, bullying and with a deep, booming voice, Maxwell was an enormous figure in British national life. Apart from Mirror Group Newspapers and the New York Daily News, his many businesses included Oxford United and Derby County football clubs. He rose from impoverishment as a Czechoslovakian refugee to become a decorated war hero, a businessman, a Labour MP and then a media mogul, amassing private jets, helicopters and Rolls-Royces en route.

His death on 5 November 1991 shocked the country. Shock turned to anger within weeks when a £460m hole was discovered in the pension funds of his companies. A borrower of unimaginable scale, he had illegally raided the funds to prop up his empire, which was on the brink of collapse. Headlines such as The Man Who Saved the Mirror were swiftly replaced by Maxwell: The Robber.

Lennox found himself at the heart of this drama when he was dispatched to help Maxwells widow, Betty, as she flew by private jet to the Canary Islands. On take-off, her husband was still missing. Mid-flight, Lennox recalls, he was summoned to the cockpit by the co-pilot. A body had been found in the Atlantic by a fisherman. The Spanish were unsure it was Maxwell. Would Lennox agree to look first to spare his widow unnecessary distress in case it was not her husband?

They landed at an airbase and Lennox was ushered into a room. And there was Maxwell. Completely naked, lying on top of the air-sea rescue officers mess table with a sheet underneath him. And, I know it sounds crazy, but he looked good. His hair still slicked back, his complexion; he looked as if he was still alive. Apart from a graze to his left shoulder, Maxwells body was unmarked, Lennox says.

He signed an affidavit that it was, indeed, the publisher. Then they asked me to come over and stand by Maxwell. There he was, laid out horizontally in front of me. I held up the affidavit and they took a photograph of me, with Robert underneath. So, somewhere in the Spanish archives, there is a photograph of me with Maxwells corpse.

The rumours started immediately. An inquest that later recorded death by heart attack and accidental drowning (although three pathologists disagreed on the exact cause of death) has failed to quell them.

People were phoning me up with all the conspiracy theories. Do you think Maxwell was knocked off? Did you see any puncture marks behind his ears? But he was unmarked, apart from that graze on his shoulder, says Lennox.

Betty, completely controlled, would later formally identify her husband. Shortly afterwards, Ghislaine flew in. She was really, really upset. You could tell, this was Daddys girl. She was inconsolable; she could hardly speak. When she saw her mother, her knees just buckled, Lennox recalls. She was really devastated. If you look through the Maxwell files, he would take her to events: Elton Johns birthday, football matches. She was always there, clinging on to him. She called him My Daddy all the time.

The fallout from Maxwells death left his familys reputation in tatters. It also landed two of his sons, Ian and Kevin, in the dock, where they successfully defended themselves in 1996 against fraud charges arising from their roles in his companies.

Kevin became Britains biggest bankrupt, to the tune of more than £400m, in the wake of the pensions scandal. His then wife, Pandora, mother to their seven children, claimed a colourful cameo on the day of Kevins arrest. On hearing an early-morning knock at the door and presuming it to be journalists, she flung open a bedroom window and yelled: Piss off or Ill call the police. We are the police, came the reply. That was priceless, says Lennox, who was among the journalists tipped off to witness the arrest.

The trial of Robert Maxwell  or the trials of Robert Maxwell, had he come back and faced the music  would have been a piece of amazing theatre. Way up there with Bernie Madoff, says Greenslade, the author of Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell and His Empire.

Ian and Kevin, like all the Maxwell children, were regularly bullied by a father who thought nothing of humiliating them in public (although Ghislaine, apparently, didnt get it quite as bad). I felt this was a proxy trial for Maxwell, says Greenslade, who attended every day of the brothers eight-month trial and was pleased when they were acquitted.

For Oxford-educated Ghislaine, the youngest of his nine children, Maxwells money had provided status and a ticket to the elite. She was dispatched to New York initially as a meeter-and-greeter, to pave her fathers way when he bought the Daily News. After his death, she made it her home. She soon became part of Epsteins inner circle and remained there for more than a decade. The two were reportedly briefly an item; they remained close.

She is said to have facilitated Epsteins social contacts, flying with him on his private jet and organising dinners for influential people at his homes. One acquaintance described her as half ex-girlfriend, half employee, half best friend and fixer. Epstein described her, in a 2003 Vanity Fair profile, as his best friend.

After he pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution and served 13 months, it appears she moved on, although she remained on New Yorks social circuit. She founded the non-profit TerraMar Project for the conservation of oceans in 2012, but it shut down abruptly last month. It is not clear how she supports herself.

She has never been accused of wrongdoing by the authorities. Allegations by Epsteins accusers that she helped procure girls for the financier have been denied repeatedly.

Maxwell, one of seven children of Jewish parents, was born Ján Ludvík Hoch in the Czechoslovakian mountain village of Slatinské Doly, now part of Ukraine and known as Solotvyno. He claimed not to have had a pair of shoes until he was seven.

He escaped Nazi occupation by fleeing to France as a teenager, but lost his parents, four siblings and most of his extended family in the Holocaust. After joining the Czechoslovak army in exile, he was evacuated to Britain and joined the British army under the name Ivan du Maurier, apparently after a cigarette brand. He fought in Normandy, met his wife  a student at the Sorbonne  and won the Military Cross for heroism on the Dutch-German border; the decoration was pinned to his chest by Field Marshal Montgomery.

Throughout his life, he was a good friend to Israel, investing heavily in publishing, pharmaceutical and computer firms in the country. He met accusations he was an Israeli spy with furious denials and legal threats. Such speculation was fanned again after his death, when he was accorded almost a state funeral in Israel, attended by the prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, and the president, Chaim Herzog, and buried in Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that Mossad killed him because Israel refused him a loan and he threatened to retaliate.

Lennox was on the private jet that took Betty and her husbands body to Israel. The crew struggled to load the oversized casket into the small plane, eventually having to prop it up at a 45-degree angle, in clear view of the passengers, he recalls. At one point, looking back, Betty remarked: Ken, what do you think? Is Robert standing on his head or his feet back there? And I said: Well, Betty, hes always landed on his feet. And she just roared with laughter.

Maxwell certainly survived many scrapes. In 1971, a Department of Trade and Industry inquiry investigating a takeover bid at his publishing company Pergamon Press concluded that Maxwell was not in our opinion a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company. It would have been a damaging setback for many, but not for the man that Private Eye nicknamed the bouncing Czech.

After the war, having changed his name once more, Ian Robert Maxwell set about recreating the family he had lost. Of his and Bettys nine children, their first-born, Michael, died aged 23, after several years in a coma following a car crash, and a daughter, Karine, died of leukaemia aged three. With the exception of Ghislaine, the surviving children lead lives away from the cameras. Ian, 62, and Kevin, 60, have reportedly set up an organisation similar to the Princes Trust in Greece.

Growing up, their home was the Oxford mansion Headington Hill Hall, leased from Oxford city council, which Maxwell described as the best council house in the country. But Sunday family lunches were rarely happy affairs. He was said to ritually humiliate his children by turn, week in, week out.

Pandora, who reportedly refers to her former father-in-law as the fat fraudster, has spoken of the corporal punishment meted out to Kevin as a child. Greenslade witnessed Maxwells public admonishments of Ian. In her autobiography, Betty, who died aged 92 in 2013, described Maxwell as bullying, unfaithful and frequently absent. But she insisted he was not the degenerate monster many said he was.

To understand Maxwell, says Julia Langdon, the political editor of the Mirror under him for five years, you have to think of him as a multipersonality. He was the City magnate, the bully, the aspirant politician, the Jewish daddy. Langdon travelled the world with him and found him fascinating. He was very bombastic, very prone to flattery, very vain. My first reaction when he died was that I could not think of anyone less likely to commit suicide. I think he fell.

Greenslade also dismisses the murder theory. Having interviewed the captain and crew of the Lady Ghislaine in depth, he has concluded that no one could have got aboard on that fateful night.

He does not have fond memories of his time with Maxwell, from 1989 to early 1991. Their first meeting, before he was hired, was at a dinner at a London casino. He behaved atrociously, sweeping all the cutlery and crockery from the table, saying it was badly laid out. He would sack people while Greenslade was away, play mind games, bully his staff. He used to urinate off the top of the Mirror building and was known to leave the door open when using his office toilet.

Staff often witnessed him trying to impress important visitors by picking up the phone and growling: Get me the White House. Get me No 10. The switchboard would ring back three minutes later and he would turn his back, pretending he was involved in a conversation. Once, Greenslade recalls, at a charity performance, Maxwell went on stage to lecture a prima ballerina on how to do a movement. That was the nature of the beast. What you have here is a kind of sociopathic, possibly borderline psychopathic, character.

He adds: Here was a man, totally found out, not able to escape and not able to bluster. And he would have been in the dock. But he might have taken some very interesting people down with him. In that respect, its shades of Epstein.",am
417,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Westpac, one of Australia's largest banks, has agreed to pay a record-breaking penalty of nearly $1 billion for systematically allowing money laundering on its watch.

The company announced Thursday that it has agreed to the 1.3 billion Australian dollar ($920 million) fine with AUSTRAC, a regulator in Australia that fights financial crime. Westpac also admitted as part of that deal that it broke anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws more than 23 million times.

""I would like to apologise sincerely for the bank's failings,"" CEO Peter King said in a statement. ""We are committed to fixing these issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again. This has been my number one priority.""

If the fine is approved by an Australian court, it would be the largest corporate penalty in the country's history. A 700 million Australian dollar ($493 million) fine was levied on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2018 after that bank admitted it failed to observe laws to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism.

Westpac shares slumped Thursday in Sydney, and were last trading down about 1%.

Australian regulators pursued legal action against Westpac nearly a year ago when they said the bank failed to report millions of instructions for financial transfers in and out of Australia.

The regulatory watchdog said at the time that Westpac neglected to do its due diligence on transactions to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia ""that have known financial indicators relating to potential child exploitation.""

King said the company has made changes to how it monitors transactions, and has hired hundreds of people responsible for looking out for financial crime. The bank also created an executive position who is directly responsible for improving its ability to address financial crimes.

The allegations rocked the bank and led to the resignation of former CEO Brian Hartzer last November.

The fine also significantly exceeds what Westpac set aside as payment for the scandal. In its announcement Thursday, the bank said it had earlier estimated a possible penalty of 900 million Australian dollars ($634 million).

The penalty reflects the ""serious and systemic nature"" of Westpac's non-compliance, AUSTRAC said in a statement Thursday.

""We have been, and will continue to work collaboratively with Westpac and all businesses we regulate to support them to meet their compliance and reporting obligations to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future,"" said AUSTRAC chief executive Nicole Rose.",am
418,"ATLANTA Two metro-Atlanta chiropractors, Allan Spagnardi and Stacy Spagnardi, have been sentenced to federal prison for using their chiropractic clinic to commit healthcare fraud and for defrauding the Internal Revenue Service.

These chiropractors used their patients personal information to obtain over a million dollars from a private insurance company, said U. S. Attorney Byung J. (BJay) Pak. Then they went further by engaging in a lengthy scheme to hide their income from the IRS. Healthcare professionals who defraud insurance companies do not just abuse the trust afforded to them by their patients, they also drive up healthcare prices for honest citizens throughout the country.

The community has a right to expect that when seeking healthcare services, their healthcare provider will not abuse their private information for personal gain,"" said Thomas J. Holloman, III, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigations. Professionals, including chiropractors, who abuse the publics trust, will be held accountable and face severe consequences including imprisonment and substantial fines. The American public deserves our vigilance in the investigation and prosecution of allegations of fraud by unscrupulous healthcare professionals who hide income and evade the payment of their fair share of taxes.

The Spagnardis chose to take advantage of patients and the entire health care industry by billing for services that were never provided and defrauding the IRS, said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. This sentence will serve as a reminder to others that the FBI will not tolerate healthcare providers who engage in schemes to steal from taxpayers and defraud the industry.

Here in Georgia, we are committed to protecting consumers and taxpayers from bad actors like the Spagnardis, whose actions erode trust in our healthcare system and lead to higher premiums across the state, said Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John F. King. Im thankful for the work of U.S. Attorney Pak and his team to bring these individuals to justice and send a clear message that these types of activities will not be tolerated in Georgia.

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: Dr. Allan Spagnardi and Dr. Stacy Spagnardi operated a chiropractic clinic located in Marietta, Georgia. Over a multi-year period, the Spagnardis used their patients personal information to bill a private insurance company for services that were never actually rendered. At times, the Spagnardis submitted claims for reimbursement for services occurring when they were not even in the country. For instance, the Spagnardis claimed that their clinic had 296 patient visits during a week that they were actually on a cruise vacation out of the country.

Despite earning well over $1 million in personal income in 2014 and 2015, the Spagnardis failed to file federal income tax returns or pay federal income taxes for those tax years and instead took steps to hide their true income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). After the Spagnardis were indicted, they continued to take steps to hide their income from the IRS, including by filing a false federal income tax return in early 2018.

Allan Spagnardi, 41, and Stacy Spagnardi, 52, both of Atlanta, Georgia, were each sentenced to four years, three months of incarceration, and three years of supervised release. Both defendants were also ordered to pay full restitution to the victim of the offense.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Georgia Office of Commissioner of Insurance investigated the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas J. Krepp and Leanne M. Marek prosecuted the case.

419,"A data leak from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda, sheds light on the business and real estate empire of Nenad Popovic, a Serbian minister found to be worth at least US$ 100 million  and possibly higher.

Appleby declared Popovic as Politically Exposed Person or PEP and a high risk. The firm also dug deeper into his backround and noted his connections to notorious financier Marc Rich and his companies activities in Russia. The request was never completed after being scuttled at some point by one of the parties.

By Dragana Pe?o and Stevan Doj?inovi?

The minister is widely known in Serbia as Russias man in the government. In fact, according to media, one of his first meetings after being named to his post last June was with Russias ambassador to Serbia, Alexander Chepurin.

The Serbian Peoples Party, which he founded in 2014, advocates closer relations between Belgrade and Moscow and opposes Serbias plans to join the European Union. Moreover, he built his business empire, controlled by his company, ABS Electro, in Russia.

Popovics Russia ties go back years. In 2008, he supported selling Serbias public oil company, NIS, to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned oil giant. According to his biography, he lectured at two universities in Moscow. And he recently told an interviewer that he is proud of the support he receives from United Russia, Russias ruling political party.

Popovic is minister-without-portfolio in charge of innovation and technology. It is not clear how he got the post, given that the Serbian government calls the countrys integration into the European Union (EU) a priority.

Paradise Papers

The Paradise Papers is a set of millions of internal documents and emails from Appleby, an offshore law firm, that were leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), Serbias KRIK, and 92 other media partners from 67 countries.

The papers relating to Popovic show that, despite his admiration for Russia and his career as a Serbian politician, he has been a legal resident and taxpayer in Switzerland since 2008.

They also show that he is very rich. Popovic has made no secret of his wealth, but the leak has, for the first time, made its extent clear. An audit by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers AG (PwC) discussed in the papers estimates his worth at least $75 million.

The documents show that he controls offshore companies registered in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands (BVI), companies in Russia, and property in at least three countries.

They also indicate that, while Appleby was initially eager to help Popovic manage his empire, it appeared to stall and delay finishing the job after discovering more about his history and his associates. It is unclear from the leaked documents which side backed away although Popovic has claimed it was him.

According to the leaked documents:

Popovic hired PwC to help him comply with Swiss tax requirements.
While serving as vice president of Serbias legislature in 2012, Popovic planned to reorganize his wealth using a web of offshore companies. The structure would be controlled by a Hong Kong trust and two companies registered on the Isle of Man.
PwC reached out to Appleby on his behalf in late 2012. Sergey Bezborodov, the firms senior manager in Zurich, emailed Appleby and pointed out that Popovics was an emergency case. We have a new client case for you, which will need to be handled in early January (2013) with a view to set up the structure and transfer the assets by the end of January, he wrote.

But Appleby never finished the job. The leaked emails show that, after digging deeper into Popovics background, the firm found Russian media reports tying his businesses to shady characters and a famous corruption case. He was marked as high risk in Applebys records and, in 2015, expunged from a list of clients.

Mr. P

Popovic was vice-president of the National Parliament of Serbia when the first approach to Appleby was made on his behalf.

In an initial email correspondence, PwCs Bezborodov didnt name Popovic. Later they would identify him as Mr. P, though its clear from the emails that Appleby knew who their client was.

Our client, of Eastern European origin but living and tax resident in Switzerland for many years, intends to transfer his wealth (operating companies and private real estate) into an asset protection structure, Bezborodov explained.

A document he sent to Appleby, titled Reorganization of Private Wealth Structure, showed Popovics intention to create two offshore companies through which he would control his businesses and real estate assets.

Popovic wanted Applebys expertise in setting up companies on the Isle of Man.

According to the plan, one Isle of Man company, to be called Gluna, would work through a series of Cyprus-based companies to control his businesses, most of which are in Russia. Another Isle of Man company, Salastrains, would use companies registered in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands to control Popovics real estate in Serbia, Montenegro, and Russia.

Popovic also wanted to register a trust in Hong Kong that would hold the two Isle of Man companies, but only become active and take control of them after he and his wife died. The trust would ensure that his family members would inherit his wealth after his death.

The client dislikes trusts, as during lifetime he wants to actively run the business and is not ready to give up control to a trustee, Bezborodov wrote. We therefore came up with a combined structure to meet his needs.

According to Andres Knobel, an analyst for the Tax Justice Network, these structures could be useful for two reasons: protecting assets from creditors and maintaining secrecy.

Trusts are even better for asset protection purposes than the other types of entities such as companies, Knobel said. A protector can be used to control the trustees discretion, he said.

The trusts are useful for secrecy, too. No one may know who owns a trust or what assets the trust holds, because trusts are hardly ever registered, Knobel said. Another part is that authorities or anyone else will never know [who] is behind the trust or other structures, in case the persons are involved in any illegal activity.

In its emails to Appleby, PwC described the wealth of Mr. P..

For Swiss tax purposes, we assessed the overall value of the business assets at approx. 65 million [Swiss francs] (US$ 65 million), one of the employees wrote. The true and fair market value is probably considerably higher. [Popovic] is currently negotiating a sale of a division of the business and the base negotiation price was assessed at US$ 100 million.

The company also estimated the value of his real estate in Russia, Serbia and Montenegro as at least 10-15 million Swiss francs ($10.7  $16 million).

Not Your Average Politician

When Appleby researchers began looking into Popovics history, they found a number of controversies. Their findings led them to double down and look harder.

They discovered that Popovic was no ordinary client, but rather a politician who belonged on a special politically exposed persons (PEP) list. Legally, people designated as such require more extensive investigations, as they are connected to controversial or powerful figures.

Investigators also turned up negative news articles, the leaked records show.

During these checks it has been highlighted that there are allegations that the client has not filed reports to the Anti-Corruption Agency, wrote an Appleby agent in an internal email, referring to a 2011 report by Global Integrity, an NGO that advocates for transparent governance.

The report states that three companies owned by Nenad Popovic signed 19 public contracts in 2010 and 2011, but failed to file [contract] paperwork [with the Agency].

According to Serbian legislation relating to the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA), state officials must report to the body when their companies participate in public procurement.

That set off alarm bells for an Appleby senior compliance officer, who wrote, I notice that as part of the new structure one of the (Isle of Man companies) is set to hold the clients operating companies  potentially they might be ones that were involved with the contracts that were not reported?  There is a risk for us, in that instance, that we might be involved with the proceeds of crime, he wrote.

When OCCRP/KRIK reporters contacted the ACA, the agency said that it had taken no action against Popovic because they have no knowledge that his firms have concluded contracts with the state. But, it said, two other actions had been filed.

In one case, Popovic failed to transfer the management of his companies to a third party as required of public officials. The ACA filed a case against him in 2013, but after he provided documents proving that he had earlier transferred control to Irina Kharisova, a Russian citizen, the case was subsequently closed.

Khrisova had also been designated as a director of one of Popovics Isle of Man companies in the scheme he had been planning.

A second case against Popovic, regarding alleged illegal actions he undertook while privatizing a company, is ongoing. The ACA notified prosecutors about potential violations in 2014, but no decision to open an investigation has yet been reached.

As for the one mentioned in the Global Integrity report, PwC told Appleby that Popovic had been cleared and that no formal court proceedings were taken. Appleby was still suspicious.

We appear to still have a shortfall relating to Mr. Popovics source of wealth, examiners wrote. We will need further detailed information in respect of Mr. Popovics source of wealth, the source of funds for the assets to be introduced and details of the historical business operations for Mr. Popovic and ABS group.

They were also concerned because his companies were registered in Cyprus. A particular feature of illicit money laundering activity conducted in Serbia is via investment into real estate and money flows through Cyprus. A part of this particular structure is apparently investment in property which is held by companys incorporated in Cyprus.

Russia and Glencore

In one of the emails to Appleby, PwC described the ownership structure of ABS Electro, Popovics holding company. The ABS Electro group of companies consists of a number of operating companies in Russia which are partially consolidated in a Cypriot holding company (ABS International Ltd.) or are owned through dedicated Cypriot holding companies, PwC wrote.

At one point they note that Popovic had made his fortune from state-run projects in Russia.

The main customers of (Popovics) ABS Group are large integrators who are realizing infrastructure projects for Russian state-controlled companies (e.g. RusHydro), PwC explained. ABS Electro distributes Western technology and equipment in Russia.

The biography they sent revealed intriguing details about Popovics business ties.

Early in his career, in 1995-1996, he worked for the late Mark Rich, the owner of the Glencore Group, who died in Switzerland in 2013. Popovic opened a representative office for Rich in Moscow and was president of a company that partnered with Glencore.

Glencore is a major commodity trader with a history of controversial dealings, including doing business with apartheid South Africa and trading in Iraqi oil in violation of UN sanctions. Rich fled to Switzerland to escape charges of tax evasion, racketeering, and dealing with Iran even as it held American hostages. He was infamously pardoned by President Clinton as one of his final acts in office.

Mr. Rich was previously indicted in the US for tax evasion and trading with Iran (Glencore), Appleby wrote in an internal report. It is noted that in this same period [Popovic] was apparently associated with Mr. Rich and he was also the President of Koalko International, which entered into contracts with Glencore.

Applebys research also found troubling allegations regarding Popovics Russian company, ABS.

Its subsidiary, Harvint?r, was involved in the construction of Putins Palace, an Italianate mansion on the coast of the Black Sea which had allegedly been funded by improper use of state funds, according to the internal Appleby report.

Appleby also noted another controversial Popovic connection in Russia which had been exposed by OCCRP partner Novaya Gazeta.

The newspaper reported that Popovics Harvinter was a subcontractor hired to help build facilities for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It is alleged that over half of the $51 billion used in the resorts construction disappeared, with some going to bribe top Kremlin officials who had influence over tenders.

A criminal investigation was launched into allegations that Vladimir Leshevski, an official working for the presidential administration, had received bribes, but was never convicted. Leshevskiys son worked as a director in Popovics company, ABS Constructor.

High Risk, Case Closed

In an Feb. 17, 2015 email, Applebys assistant manager told his colleague that the Popovic case can be closed.

The Serbian government did not find Popovic too high risk to be appointed minister. After he took on the role, he did report the Cyprus and BVI-based companies mentioned in the leaked documents to the state ACA, as OCCRP/KRIK reporters saw in his file.

OCCRP/KRIK journalists contacted Minister Popovic for an interview a month ago. His chief of staff answered that Popovic was on a business trip and was too busy to meet. Ten days ago reporters sent him questions which he never answered.",am
420,"""The defendants callously thought they could line their pockets with lottery winnings without consequence, but today their luck ran out,"" said Seth D. DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

Prosecutors say the four took part in the scheme between April 2019 and August 2020, and that investigators intercepted calls where the men were allegedly heard discussing their scheme and attempting to cover their tracks, according to court filings.

The scheme funded lavish lifestyles, prosecutors say

Kurland has been a practicing attorney for 20 years and was a partner in the law firm Rivkin Radler, according to court filings, which also state that Kurland's clients from across the nation have won $3 billion combined.

Prosecutors allege Kurland touted himself as someone who lottery winners could trust to help safeguard their winnings and give sound investment advice. Some lottery winners paid millions of dollars to retain his services, according to court filings. Prosecutors also allege Kurland directed his associates to return money to cover their tracks when the FBI began interviewing people associated with the case.

Tim Kasulis, an attorney for Kurland, said in a statement that his client looks forward to having his day in court.

""Over his twenty year unblemished legal career, Jason Kurland has always had his clients' best interests at heart and continues to do so today,"" Kasulis said.

Laurie Bloom, a spokeswoman for Rivkin Radler, told CNN the firm has terminated its relationship with Kurland.

""We were taken by complete surprise by the allegations against Mr. Kurland. The firm has no role in nor knowledge of the criminal activities described,"" Bloom said in a statement to CNN. ""We were contacted today by the US Attorney's office and are cooperating in their investigation.""

Kurland allegedly used money from the scheme for luxury vehicles, including a $113,000 Porsche. Kurland is free on a $1 million bond.

Russo and Smookler were accused of investing some of the lottery winners' money in a jewelry business, whose owner prosecutors say lost much of the money and was later extorted. Prosecutors allege Russo and Smookler threatened the business owner for not paying back the loan on time. Smookler allegedly told him in March in an intercepted conversation ""You're gonna get f**king tortured,"" according to court filings. Russo allegedly told the man, ""they're going to make you watch as they rip your son's teeth out of his mouth ... they're going to do worse things to your wife.""

Prosecutors said in a hearing Wednesday that investigators recovered a weapon at Smookler's home this week. Smookler was released on a $2.5 million bond. CNN has reached out to Smookler's attorney for comment.

A magistrate judge initially approved a $2 million bond for Russo, but at an appeal hearing Wednesday, US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis overturned that decision and ordered him to remain detained, citing Russo's violent threats and the fact that investigators found a tactical shotgun under his bed.

""I've handled organized crime cases for 20 years, I've never come across threats like these,"" Garaufis said during the teleconference hearing.

Defense attorney Joseph Conway said at the hearing that Russo's threats ""were nothing more than trying to get their money back.""

""These threats were colorful, they were boisterous, but they were nothing more than puffery,"" Conway said.

Conway said in a statement to CNN he was disappointed that Russo is being detained and will ""expeditiously seek to prove his innocence at trial.""

The fourth defendant, Chierchio, is someone prosecutors claim is a soldier in the Genovese crime family of La Cosa Nostra, an allegation his attorney Gerald McMahon refutes, saying that Chierchio has never been associated with the mafia ""in any fashion.""

But prosecutors allege that Chierchio took millions of dollars from two lottery winners and spent it freely living a lavish life that included being driven around by a chauffeur in a Cadillac Escalade, yacht club fees and living in a luxury $11,000-a-month apartment in Manhattan. Chierchio is free on a $3 million bond.

McMahon, in a statement to CNN, said that Chierchio invested funds as part of a group that was selling face shields and masks this spring, as shortages of personal protective equipment grew due to coronavirus concerns. McMahon said Chierchio's group worked with a state that agreed to buy $800 million in PPE but backed out of the deal, leaving the group with $40 million in PPE sitting in a warehouse. McMahon said the group's attorneys have sent a letter to the state demanding a resolution to the dispute.",am
421,"(Yicai Global) June 24 -- The China Securities Regulatory Commission has made use of the countrys Beidou Navigation and Positioning System to pinpoint Chinese scalloper Zoneco Groups movements in the sea and finally expose the true extent of its accounting fraud.

Dalian-based Zoneco, one of Chinas largest seafood suppliers, has been slapped with a CNY600,000 (USD84,750) fine for alleged information disclosure violations and its chairman, Wu Hougang, banned from the securities market for life, the CSRC said today.

Fifteen people involved in the scam were also each fined between CNY30,000 to CNY300,000, and four people were given five-year to lifelong market bans, it added.

The financial statements of the firm have come under intense scrutiny in recent years after a succession of huge, fishy losses. In October 2014 Zoneco said it had scrapped CNY800 million (USD113 million) in scallop stocks. In January 2018 it claimed a shortage of food had starved CNY630 million worth of the shellfish to death. Another CNY300 million worth mysteriously perished last year.

It is extremely difficult to know how many of these bottom dwellers are available in a specific area of the sea as they are cannot be seen with the naked eye. It was only through the use of top of the range technology, including Big Data and cloud computing, that the CSRC were able to expose Zonecos fraud.

By analyzing the satellite positioning of the companys fishing boats, the CSRC was able to discover the true extent of the fishing area covered by Zoneco over the last two years, and to substantiate that Zoneco had doctored its financial data, including costs, non-operating expenses and profits, the Shanghai Securities Journal reported.

422,"By

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP)  The leader of an ill-fated effort to revive the People Express airline has been indicted on fraud and tax evasion charges.

The Daily Press reports Michael D. Morisi was arrested Tuesday, accused of defrauding creditors of nearly $448,000. An indictment says he used most of the money to pay himself and other airline executives months after the airline folded.

The indictment also says the former executive director of Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport, Ken Spirito, arranged for public funds to guarantee $5 million in credit for the airline. The company folded in 2014 and stopped paying the $4.5 million it owed TowneBank under the credit line. The airport was left to foot the bill, which taxpayers ultimately got stuck for.

Spirito was arrested Monday and charged with violating federal finance laws.

Accused Russian cybercriminal Alexander Vinniks legal odyssey continues Monday in Paris, where he faces trial on charges of extortion, money laundering and involvement in organized crime.

Its the latest milestone in a case that spans multiple countries: Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece, which extradited him to France this year with the understanding that he was also wanted in the U.S. and Russia.

French and U.S. prosecutors allege Vinnik helped create the infamous Locky ransomware and then launder the resulting bitcoin ransom payments through the BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange. French prosecutors are focusing on $157 million that the alleged scheme captured from French organizations. A U.S. indictment says he laundered as much as $4 billion while running BTC-e, which also allegedly provided services to other scams. In Russia, he faces smaller-scale charges of fraud.

Vinniks arrival in France in January followed a nearly two-year battle over where Greek authorities would send the 41-year-old, who has denied any wrongdoing and says he was only a technical consultant for BTC-e. Greek law enforcement arrested him at the behest of the U.S.

In January after he was extradited to France, Vinnik began a 35-day hunger strike saying he wanted to be extradited to Russia instead.

In June, New Zealand worked with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in freezing the equivalent of $90 million in assets belonging to Vinnik. He allegedly controlled a company registered in New Zealand called the Canton Business Corporation.

While Vinniks case landed in France, U.S. actions against alleged Russian cybercriminals have continued to gain headlines this year. In September a grand jury indicted two men for cryptocurrency fraud. In July, hacker Yevgeniy Nikulin was found guilty of stealing data from LinkedIn and Formspring and was later sentenced to about 7 years in prison. On a different but sometimes related track, federal agencies are also monitoring Russian activity as part of efforts to protect the 2020 elections.

424,"Brussels-based KBC Group NV and its banking arm KBC Bank are facing prosecution for their purported roles in facilitating money laundering and tax fraud by Belgian clients.

The banking group disclosed the charges by the Ghent public prosecutors office in a statement on its website Thursday and said it intends to mount a comprehensive defence at trial. The allegations involve Belgian clients who have repatriated their foreign assets since 2005, according to the bank, which contends it had acted appropriately given the information it had at the time.

There were enough elements for KBC to conclude that there was no suspicion of money laundering, such as information regarding, among other things, the tax legitimation process carried out by the clients, the statement made by the clients legal counsel [and] transparent asset transfers, the group said.

In a news report Thursday, The Brussels Times said the clients include four members of the family that owns the door and windows construction firm Engels, based in Lokeren. Over the course of 13 years, members of the Engels family repatriated millions of euros previously held in a Swiss bank account, but four of the individualsa mother and her three sonsfailed to pay taxes and fines for the sum, the news outlet said.

The prosecutor believes that KBC shouldve flagged and reported the transactions as suspicious, according to the newspaper, which also cites a statement by elder brother Didier Engels indicating that the family intends to fight the charges.

In recent years, the bank has repeatedly upgraded its systems to identify and prevent tax evasion, bolstered its technological capabilities, strengthened its investigatory staff and scrutinized the suspicious transactions it reports to regulatory authorities, according to the banks statement.

The disclosure comes as the European Unions banking sector continues to grapple with money laundering scandals that have expanded from Baltic and Nordic countries to include some of the economic blocs most well-known banks.

KBC Group, which has nearly 1,400 bank branches and approximately 11 million clients, operates primarily in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Ireland, according to its 2018 annual report.",am
425,"(CBS/AP) LOS ANGELES - Federal officials say five people were arrested Monday in a laundering scheme that allegedly funneled millions of dollars in Colombian and Mexican drug money through an American toy company.

Jia Hui Zhou and Dan Xin Li, the owners of Woody Toys in the City of Industry, a Los Angeles suburb, were arrested along with three company employees on charges of evading federal reporting requirements for financial transactions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said.

Two toy dealers from Mexico were arrested earlier on similar charges.

Jose Miguel Yong-Hinojosa was taken into custody Saturday night at Los Angeles International Airport, and Luis Ernesto Flores Rivera was arrested earlier this month in Texas, the agency said in a statement.

Zhou and the two toy dealers are also charged with conspiring to launder money in a scheme that officials said channeled at least $6 million to the California toy company between 2005 and 2011.

Bond was denied for Yong-Hinojosa, and set at $150,000 for the two company owners. Bond amounts ranged from $20,000 to $100,000 for the other three men.

The Mexican toy dealers bought U.S. dollars made off drug sales from currency brokers in a ""black market peso exchange,"" officials said. That exchange enabled drug traffickers to get rid of drug dollars and gave the toy dealers a more favorable exchange rate so they could then purchase toys in the United States, authorities said.

The dealers would then send the money to Woody Toys via courier or bank deposits. Authorities said Woody Toys failed to file required paperwork when the company received deposits of more than $10,000 and also intentionally structured bank deposits in smaller increments to avoid having to do so.

If convicted of evading federal reporting requirements, the defendants could face up to five years in prison. The money laundering charge can carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.",am
426,"The Supreme Court on Friday, August 9, 2019 ordered the reopening of the US$247,500 case that involved operatives of the National Security Agency (NSA), including the agencys former director, Fombah Sirleaf, a son of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and some Korean investors, as part of the corruption investigation that the Special Independent Committee initiated since late 2014.

The committee, headed by the late Counselor David A.B. Jallah, then Dean and Professor of Law at the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law, University of Liberia, was instructed by Madam Sirleaf to investigate the incident.

The courts decision on Friday was necessitated by a judgment of then assigned Judge Peter Gbeneweleh of the 13 th Judicial Circuit Court in Margibi County. However, Gbeneweleh dismissed the Korean businessmens US$2,849,000 Action of Damages for Wrong lawsuit against the NSA.

The investors in their 2015 suit claimed that while in custody at NSA headquarters, they were stripped naked and subjected to various forms of humiliation without any formal charge and were never advised of their rights as required by the law.

In his ruling at the time, Judge Gbeneweleh said that the Korean nationals produced insufficient evidence to reasonably support their accusation that they were subjected to various forms of humiliation and degradation, thereby supporting the NSA lawyers Motion for Judgment During Trial filed to the court.

A motion for judgment as a matter of law, is made by a party during trial, claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case. If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party, judgment is entered by the court and the case is over, a legal expert explained to the Daily Observer.

Besides, Gbeneweleh ordered that the NSAs operatives should not take the witness stand to provide their individual testimony about the accusation.

However, reading the High Courts opinion, Justice Yussif Kaba, said the evidence produced by the Korean investors when they rested their case created a rebuttal presumption, therefore, the trial judge was in error when he granted the judgment during the trial.

Justice Kaba: The courts judgment is reversed, therefore, the case is hereby remanded for a new trial.

It can be recalled that the Jallah Commission produced a 3-volume, 399-page report and handed it at first to Dr. Edward McClain (now deceased), then Minister of State for Presidential affairs, instead of President Sirleaf.

The Jallah Commission found out that the Korean businessmen committed no crime as the NSA had alleged to justify the seizure and arrest.

Further, the Jallah Commission uncovered an NSA operatives conspiracy directly involved, along with the gold dealer Naseer Aly, and two others from outside the agency, to defraud the Korean businessmen.

Among the reports recommendations, the committee called for return of the cash seized to the Korean businessmen, and for the matter to be referred to the Ministry of Justice to prosecute all conspirators.

The investigation further found that the seizure was an NSA operatives conspiracy and co-conspirators outside the agency, who had lured the Korean businessmen to Liberia, and recommended prosecution of all perpetrators.

President Sirleaf did not heed to the Jallahs recommendation, which prompted the Korean investors to file the lawsuit of US$2,849,000 as damages against the NSA.

Madam Christiana Tah, then Minister of Justice and Attorney General, resigned, accusing President Sirleaf of interference in an NSA investigation.

The case grew when a group of four Korean businessmen had arranged the purchase of gold bars through emails with Nasser Aly, whom they believed to be a Lebanese gold dealer with mining interests in Liberia.

Under the deal negotiated by Kim Aleck, one of the Korean businessmen, the counter parties agreed to the sale of 16 kilograms (35 lbs) of gold at the price of US$568,000.

Half of the purchase price, amounting to US$284,000, was to be paid upfront in Liberia.

On July 8, 2014, the NSA operatives carried out a raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia, without a warrant.

Five NSA operatives burst into a hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes.

The NSA seized cash in the amount of US$247,500 and other possessions, including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards.

Earlier, on the day of the raid, the Korean businessmen had withdrawn the same amount of money seized from the Sinkor, Old Road branch of the International Bank of Liberia and then gone directly to the City King Hotel, expecting to complete the transaction with Aly.

The Korean businessmen were arrested by the operatives and taken from the hotel to the headquarters of the NSA.

Later, NSA charged the Korean nationals with the commission of crimes of illegal possession of combustible cyanide that posed national security risk to the lives of Liberians, money laundering, counterfeiting, and conspiracy to defraud the government.

The criminal charges were later dropped against the Korean investors by the Criminal Court C at the Temple of Justice, which prompted their civil lawsuit against the NSA.",am
427,"ATLANTA  Larry Scott has pleaded guilty to wire fraud for failing to disclose to the City of Atlanta that while he served as its Director of Contract Compliance, he also served as the business manager for a consulting firm seeking contracts in the Atlanta-metropolitan area. Scott also failed to report on his taxes the majority of the income earned from the consulting firm.

Larry Scott betrayed the citizens of Atlanta by failing to disclose that when he served in an executive level position with the City of Atlanta, he was simultaneously working for a consulting firm for businesses who sought contracts in metro-Atlanta, said U.S. Attorney Byung J. BJay Pak. Scotts divided loyalty undermined the integrity of the office he served at the City of Atlanta.

Deceitful and self-indulgent people have no place in public office at any level of government, said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. Today's plea doesn't mean our work is done, the FBI and our partners remain committed to ending public corruption in Atlanta and the Georgia community.

Public officials, whether elected or appointed, should expect to be held to a higher standard of trust in the eyes of the public. That trust is broken when these officials engage in malfeasance or commit crimes. Failure to disclose income and file a correct income tax return is a crime! No public official gets a free pass to ignore the tax laws, and IRS-CI works to ensure that everyone pays their fair share, said Thomas J. Holloman, III, Atlanta Field Office Special Agent in Charge IRS-Criminal Investigations.

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: the City of Atlanta - Mayors Office of Contract Compliance serves as a liaison, linking Small, Minority, Female and Disadvantaged Businesses with City of Atlanta related business opportunities and encourages equal opportunity for all businesses and individuals in the Atlanta workplace, and has a stated mission to mitigate the effects of past and present discrimination against women and minority businesses  [and] to promote full and equal business opportunity for all persons doing business with the City of Atlanta.

From 2002 to 2019, Scott held several positions with the City of Atlanta, including, serving as the: (a) Senior Contract Compliance Manager in the Office of Contract Compliance; (b) Director of Procurement in the Department of Watershed Management, and (c) the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance. In those positions, Scott earned between $57,000 and $98,000 per year. In total, from 2012 to 2017, Scott earned approximately $530,000 as an employee with the City of Atlanta.

On February 23, 2011, Scott incorporated Cornerstone U.S. Management Group, LLC (Cornerstone) with the Georgia Secretary of State as a for-profit corporation.

Cornerstone is a consulting firm for businesses seeking contracts in the Atlanta-metropolitan area and elsewhere. In its Articles of Organization, Cornerstone listed Scott as its organizer and registered agent. From 2012 until November 2017, Scott served as Cornerstones business manager. In that role and during that six-year period, Cornerstone paid Scott between approximately $1,000 and $5,000 per month. In total, from 2012 to 2017, Scott earned approximately $220,000 as Cornerstones business manager.

According to the City of Atlantas Code of Ethics, certain City of Atlanta officials and employees must disclose all positions of employment held by the official or employee in any business . . . for all or any portion of the year, including a description of the type of business and the existence and nature of any business done by the employer entity with the city. The City of Atlantas Code of Ethics further requires that these officials and employees disclose [e]ach and every source of income from any business received by such official or employee in excess of $5,000 derived from any single source in the preceding calendar year.

As the City of Atlantas Senior Contract Compliance Manager, Director of Procurement, and Director of Contract Compliance, the City of Atlanta required Scott to complete annually a Financial Disclosure Statement listing any outside employment and sources of income of more than $5,000 per year for calendar years 2012 to 2017.

From 2012 to 2017, Scott electronically filed six (6) false Financial Disclosure Statements, each executed under penalty of perjury. On each Financial Disclosure Statement, Scott knowingly failed to disclose that he had been employed by Cornerstone and that he had received more than $5,000 in annual income from Cornerstone.

From 2012 to 2017, Scott earned approximately $220,000 from Cornerstone while serving as a full-time management or executive level employee with the City of Atlanta. Scott never disclosed to the City of Atlanta his employment with and income from Cornerstone. Scott knew that if he had disclosed his income from Cornerstone on his annual Financial Disclosure Statements, the City of Atlanta could have terminated Scott.

From 2012 to 2017, Scott also filed six (6) false and fraudulent federal income tax returns  in that Scott failed to report the majority of the income that he earned from Cornerstone on his tax returns. For example, in 2015, Scott earned approximately $156,036 in income  (a) $99,136 as the City of Atlantas Director of Contract Compliance; and (b) $56,900 as Cornerstones business manager. Yet, on his 2015 federal income tax return, Scott falsely listed his total income as only $101,630.

Based on his conduct, Larry Scott, 54, of Atlanta, Georgia, was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, one count each of wire and tax fraud.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation are investigating this case.

428,"Washington, DC - An indictment was unsealed Monday charging John David McAfee with tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division and U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant for the Western District of Tennessee. The June 15, 2020 indictment was unsealed following McAfees arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition.

According to the indictment, John McAfee earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary. From 2014 to 2018, McAfee allegedly failed to file tax returns, despite receiving considerable income from these sources. The indictment does not allege that during these years McAfee received any income or had any connection with the anti-virus company bearing his name.

According to the indictment, McAfee allegedly evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees. The indictment further alleges McAfee attempted to evade the IRS by concealing assets, including real property, a vehicle, and a yacht, in the names of others.

If convicted, McAfee faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum sentence of one year in prison on each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

429,"Former Moi and Kibaki era minister Sally Kosgey is among hundreds of powerful people named in new International Consortium of Investigative Journalists leaks. Dubbed Paradise Papers the leaks reveal confidential records of financial hideaways of the worlds iconic brands and powerful brokers.

The worlds biggest businesses, heads of state and global figures in politics, entertainment and sport who have sheltered their wealth in secretive tax havens are being revealed this week in a major new investigation into Britains offshore empires.

The details come from a leak of 13.4m files that expose the global environments in which tax abuses can thrive  and the complex and seemingly artificial ways the wealthiest corporations can legally protect their wealth.

Most of the documents  6.8m  relate to a law firm and corporate services provider that operated together in 10 jurisdictions under the name Appleby. Last year, the fiduciary arm of the business was the subject of a management buyout and it is now called Estera.

The material, which has come from two offshore service providers and the company registries of 19 tax havens, was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Paradise Papers says Moi-era head of Public Service Sally Kosgei used a secret Mauritian-registered firm to buy a $1 million (Sh103.66 million) apartment in Central London 16 years ago.

Also mentioned is former Deputy Chief Justice Kalpana Rawal. This is the second time Rawal features in the leaks. She was initially mentioned in the Panama Papers.",am
430,"Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely.

Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. ""You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,"" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing ""privacy issues."" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: ""As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that."" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? ""Between the election and the nomination.""

So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process.

Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. ""Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate."" They declined to provide further answers on the record.

But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--""I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt""--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades.

""Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,"" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: ""He's lied to a lot of people.""

Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes:

TWENTY-SIX YEARS before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone.

Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, ""It's too early for Christmas."" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. ""I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,"" Trump said at the time.

The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. ""He was very, very sharp,"" says someone who worked with him back then. ""Very tough."" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that.

Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. ""People knew of him,"" says another former colleague, ""but not on his own."" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: ""He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.""

Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities.

Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003.

Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock.

Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million.

A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time.

""I just spoke to Ross,"" the reporter wrote. ""He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.""

""I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,"" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . ""And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' ""

Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. ""Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,"" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth.

WITHIN DAYS OF that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. ""She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,"" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. ""It was a perfect merger."" Adds another contemporary: ""She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.""

Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist René Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million.

His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds.

With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion.

That wasn't enough. ""I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,"" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. ""2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,"" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: ""3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.""

Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? ""You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,"" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. ""Really, for us, it was a bet on him, "" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. ""I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past."" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets.

IN 2010, ROSS set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call.

There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story.

In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million.

The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: ""Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.""

ON NOVEMBER 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross.

But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. ""I'd rather hang myself,"" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. ""I don't know why Wilbur took it.""

But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance.

Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion.

His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. ""It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,"" one ex-employee said. ""I was surprised that he would take that risk.""

But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations?

""I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,"" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . ""Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.""

After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. ""It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.""

The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. ""Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.""

The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross.

431,"LONDON: Marriott International Inc, the world's largest hotel operator, is facing a London class action brought by millions of former hotel guests demanding compensation after their personal data was hacked in one of the largest data breaches in history.

Martin Bryant, founder of technology and media consultancy Big Revolution, is leading the claim for English and Welsh-domiciled guests after more than 300 million customer records from Marriott's global database, potentially including passport and credit card details, were hacked between 2014 and 2018.

""I hope this case will raise awareness of the value of our personal data, result in fair compensation ... and also serve notice to other data owners that they must hold our data responsibly,"" he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for loss of control of personal data, automatically includes guests who made a reservation for one of the former Starwood brand hotels - including Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and St. Regis hotels - before Sept. 10, 2018.

Bryant is represented by law firm Hausfeld and the case is funded by Harbour Litigation.

Around seven million UK guest records were involved, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which last year proposed a 99.2 million pound (US$133 million) fine over the breach.

A London-based spokeswoman for Marriott was not immediately available for comment.

Marriott announced in 2018 that hackers had accessed its Starwood hotels reservation database and notified the FBI.

""We fell short of what our guests deserve,"" Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said at the time.

Attorneys filed a lawsuit in a Maryland federal court within hours of the disclosure. Others followed suit in the U.S. and Canada.

The London class action has been filed in the High Court after a landmark Court of Appeal decision last October that a collective action could be served against Internet giant Google over alleged unlawful tracking of iPhone users in 2011 and 2012 through third party cookies.

Google is appealing.

432,"The CBI has booked retired deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty, the main accused in the Rs 13,000-crore Punjab National Bank fraud allegedly perpetrated by Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi, in a fresh case of receiving a bribe of Rs 1.08 crore from Rishika Financials that arranged bank guarantees for Gitanjali Gems, officials said.

It is alleged that the owner of Rishika Financials, Debajyoti Dutta, was in the business of arranging quotes of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) from foreign funding banks, they said on Monday. The officials said that after getting confirmation from Dutta, Shetty used to issue LoUs using the international banking messaging service, SWIFT.

Dutta used to work for Gitanjali Gems, promoted by Choksi, and had allegedly raised bills of 0.05 per cent of the LoUs issued for the firm as brokerage, they said. The amount used to get credited to Dutta's current account from which 40 per cent, over Rs 1.08 crore, was allegedly paid to Shetty between 2014 and 2017, the officials said.

LoU is a guarantee which is given by an issuing bank to Indian banks having branches abroad to grant short-term credit to an applicant. In case of default, the bank issuing the LoU has to pay the liability to the credit-giving bank along with accruing interest. The companies of Modi and Choksi took loans from banks abroad on the basis of LoUs but did not repay them transferring the liability on Punjab National Bank (PNB).

It is alleged that Shetty bypassed PNB's core banking system, Finacle, and issued LoUs fraudulently, the officials said. Shetty, who is alleged to have played a key role in the Rs 13,700-crore loan fraud while working as deputy manager at PNB's Brady House branch in Mumbai, was arrested in March, 2018.

It was found during investigation that messages for fraudulent LoUs were sent to overseas banks by misusing the international messaging system for banking, SWIFT, and without making their subsequent entries in Finacle, thus bypassing any scrutiny of such funds in the bank, they said.",am

During a video released on Tuesday, the Attorney General of the Republic, Alejandro Gertz Manero, revealed the accusations by the former head of Mexican state oil firm Pemex, Emilio Lozoya, and said that his office was opening a case.

Loyoza said that he had allocated 100 million pesos he received from Brazilian construction company Odebretch to fund Nieto's campaign and to pay for foreign electoral advisers.

According to the allegations, Nieto and his Secretary of the Treasury, Luis Videgaray, instructed Lozoya to use 404 million pesos to buy the votes of senators and deputies. The goal was to win the support on a group of reforms carried during 2013 and 2014 named Pacto de Mexico.

Moreover, Loyoza said that he could present four witnesses, videos, and documents to back up his accusations. The former Pemex president remains in Mexico to face trial over a corruption case that involves the Odebrecht company.

434,"As is known, Yoshiyama Tanaka had also been Congress Chairman during ex-President Alberto Fujimori's regime (1990-2000).

This information was provided by the prosecutor at the hearing presided over by Judge Richard Concepcion Carhuancho to assess the preventive detention request for the other people accused of alleged money laundering offenses.

According to Perez, Yoshiyama Sasaki accompanied by his lawyer had appeared at the Prosecutor's office in order to confess.

Yoshiyama Sasaki indicated that between February and March 2011 his uncle Yoshiyama Tanaka had asked him if any of his friends were economically solvent so as to be presented as fake donors to Fuerza 2011's presidential campaign.

After telling his uncle the name of a friend, Yoshiyama Tanaka gave him US$100,000 in cash, along with the Scotiabank account numbers to make the deposits.

Furthermore, the nephew had visited Yoshiyama Tanaka six or seven times from March to mid-July 2011. On every occasion, he had been handed over between US$100,000 and US$200,000 in cash.

Yoshiyama Sasaki even confessed he had coordinated with the fake donors to deny these facts in case of being questioned by the police, or to rule out having accepted to lend their names.

Additionally during the hearing Yoshiyama Tanaka's lawyer, Humberto Abanto, informed his client has affirmed he had received money from businesspeople and then laundered it through fake campaign donations.

Judge Concepcion Carhuancho has already ordered a 36-month preventive detention for Fuerza Popular party leader Keiko Fujimori and her advisor in the shadows Vicente Silva Checa, who is considered a close acquaintance of Vladimiro Montesinos.

Montesinos was the long-standing head of Peru's intelligence service (SIN) under former President Alberto Fujimori.

In 2000, secret videos which he had recorded were televised that showed him bribing an elected congressman to leave the opposition and join the Fujimorist side of Congress.

After having fled to Japan and traveled to Chile from where he was extradited to Peru the Fujimori patriarch was sentenced for crimes against human rights and corruption committed during his term in office.

In 2017, he was pardoned by ex-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who later stepped down amid a political scandal.",am
435,"The rise of Monzo has been nothing short of remarkable. Rave reviews from customers who universally loved its app-based banking, plus awards and glowing write-ups from the likes of Which?, helped it to become the UKs fastest-growing bank. But what has led to so many customers claiming they have been badly let down after Monzo froze their account for no apparent reason? Others claim the bank has refused to refund fraudulently taken payments.

In the past few months, complaints from previously happy Monzo customers appear to have grown alarmingly, at a time when the bank is trying to get more people to go full Monzo and use its service as their main current account.

Resolver, the independent online complaints resolution service, this week told Guardian Money it had received more than 700 complaints in a little over a year about Monzo, which it describes as a surprising number for a relatively new business. The majority have come in during the past six months. In a third of those cases, its users are specifically saying that their account has been frozen or shut down.

A private Facebook group, Monzo stole our money, has grown to 850 members, mostly customers complaining that their accounts were frozen without warning. The stories on it may alarm some of those thinking of going full Monzo, with reports of accounts shut days before Christmas, and waits of several weeks to get balances returned. Some posters describe having their accounts reprieved and receiving £750 compensation. Others have reported taking the bank to court to get their balances returned.

In October, the BBCs Watchdog programme highlighted the account closure problem, and the impact its policies were having on the banks customers. On the review website Trustpilot it is a similar story, with 13% of reviewers rating Monzo as bad at the time of writing. Posters have described being left at petrol stations unable to pay for fuel or stranded abroad after their account was frozen without warning.

Despite this, Monzo denies that it has changed the way it monitors activity, or that it has a problem with freezing accounts. It claims that when it investigates its frozen accounts, it finds it made the correct decision in 95% of cases.

Monzos 3.2 million customers manage their account using its mobile app. There is a phone line, but those who have their account frozen after the bank finds irregularities are barred from using it.

Resolvers Martyn James suggests that the company appears to be in denial. Its clear that something is going wrong with Monzos current account systems. With people reporting that low-value transactions seem to be resulting in frozen accounts, its clear this cant be anything to do with the laws surrounding money laundering.

Even if a bank decides it doesnt want your business, it has to give you a months notice to make alternative arrangements. Shutting accounts and declining to help has a huge impact on people  particularly if they are getting by on tight budgets or benefits, he says.

Arun Chauhan, a solicitor dealing with financial crime, told Watchdog that Monzos compliance procedures appeared not to have caught up with its growth in customer numbers.

Some customers have separately contacted Guardian Money to describe their bafflement at their treatment after they were the victims of fraud. Customers inability to talk to someone at Monzo when things go wrong has become a particular source of anger.

Mick Lown, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, who is retired and makes guitars, says he was initially delighted with Monzo, particularly its fee-free purchases abroad. He is furious, however, at its response after his eBay account was hacked and £141 taken from his Monzo account to pay for two video games.

He says the bank initially refunded the money, but it was then taken from his account a second time. All his attempts to get the bank to refund the payments, which he is adamant he didnt authorise, failed.

When I challenged it, they sent me proof from a totally unrelated purchase but refused to refund the money, he says. Their automated response system is impossible to deal with if you have a serious complaint. Im now going to have to go to the ombudsman. Im just pleased I kept my main bank account as I no longer trust them.

In December, Money spoke to customer whose Monzo account was taken over by fraudsters, who sent £214 to a Dutch account.

The customer says she was initially told that there was nothing the bank could do, even though the payment was clearly unauthorised and fraudulent. Following Moneys intervention, her money was returned.

A spokeswoman for Monzo says: Its wrong to draw any conclusions about Monzos financial crime practices and customer service by solely using anonymous comments made online. Regulation prohibits all banks from discussing with anyone why an account has been blocked  its a legal offence called tipping off that is designed to protect ongoing law enforcement investigations.

Blocking accounts is a legal requirement, and as a regulated bank we have a duty to detect and prevent financial crime.

The spokeswoman says that, having investigated, the company stood by its decision in relation to Mick Lowns case. Where we get things wrong we put them right and compensate customers, she adds.

James Daley, who runs the Fairer Finance website, says it is no surprise to see cracks possibly starting to appear in the challenger banks offering. Monzo has looked to be the triumph of marketing over substance. While it is relatively easy to build a mobile app, history teaches us that it is very hard for a new bank to build up the kind of systems needed to properly manage millions of accounts.

We have seen it with Metro, and now seemingly with Monzo, he adds. Our most recent research found that relatively few Monzo customers use it as their main current account, and I dont see that changing any time soon.",am

""Choppergate"" redirects here. For the 2011 Nine News Queensland controversy, see Nine News Queensland § ""Choppergate"" controversy.

Also referred to as the AugustaWestland VVIP chopper deal, the Indian helicopter bribery scandal by Congress led UPA Government refers to a multimillion-dollar corruption case in India, wherein money was paid to middlemen and Indian officials in 2006 and 2007 to purchase helicopters for high level politicians. [1] As per the CBI, this amounted to ?2.5 billion (US$35 million), transferred through bank accounts in the UK and UAE.

It came to light in early 2013, when an Indian national parliamentary investigation began into allegations of bribery and corruption involving several senior officials and a helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland surrounding the purchase of a new fleet of helicopters. The scandal has been referred to as the Chopper scam or Choppergate by the media and popular press. [2] Several Indian Congress politicians and military officials were accused of accepting bribes from AgustaWestland in order to win the ?36 billion (US$500 million) Indian contract for the supply of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters; these helicopters are intended to perform VVIP duties for the President of India and other important state officials. [3] Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, is alleged by Italian prosecutors to have received kickbacks from the deal. [4]

A note presented in the Italian court, sent by middleman Christian Michel (who was extradited to India on 4 December 2018), asks Peter Hulett, an Agusta Westland employee, to target key advisors to Sonia Gandhi and lists their names as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel, Pranab Mukherjee, M. Veerappa Moily, Oscar Fernandes, M. K. Narayanan and Vinay Singh. The note also contains the bribes to be paid out, divided as ""AF"" 6 million, ""BUR"" 8.4 million, ""Pol"" 6 million and ""AP"" 3 million. [5] [6] [7] On 8 January 2018, the third Court of Appeals of Milan acquitted the defendants on all charges [8] Abhay Tyagi was also accused to have received kickbacks worth ?69,00,000.

The case continues to be investigated in India by the Indian government and the CBI. [1]

Overview[ edit ]

The Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) signed a contract to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in February 2010 for the Communication Squadron of Indian Air Force to carry the president, PM and other VVIPs. Controversy over the contract came to light on 12 February 2013 with the arrest of Giuseppe Orsi, the CEO of Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's parent company by Italian authorities over corruption and bribery charges; [9] the following day Indian Defence Minister A.K. Antony ordered a probe into the contract. [10]

Critical Events[ edit ]

On 25 March 2013, India's Defence Minister A.K. Antony confirmed corruption allegations by stating: ""Yes, corruption has taken place in the helicopter deal and bribes have been taken. The CBI is pursuing the case very vigorously."" [11] As of June 2014, the Indian government has recovered a total amount of ?20.68 billion (US$290 million) [12] and has recovered around ?16.2 billion (US$230 million) (45% of the total contract value ?36 billion (US$500 million)) it had paid to AgustaWestland. [13]
On 8 April 2016, the Milan Court of Appeal, in a 225-page judgement, overturned a lower court verdict and convicted helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland's executive Giuseppe Orsi to four years' imprisonment for paying a 30 million bribe to Indian politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force officials. [14]
On 9 December 2016, the CBI arrested former Indian Air Force Chief S.P. Tyagi along with his cousin Sanjeev Tyagi and lawyer Gautam Khaitan. [15] In September 2017, the CBI filed a formal chargesheet against S.P. Tyagi and nine others.
On 16 December 2016, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassazione cancelled the April 2016 conviction sentence, and ordered a retrial to be held again in Milan.
On 8 January 2018, the third Court of Appeals of Milan acquitted the defendants on all charges [8]
On 5 December 2018, Christian Michel, the alleged middleman was extradited to India from Dubai. [16]
On 31 January 2019, Another co-accused Rajeev Saxena and lobbyist Deepak Talwar were extradited to India from Dubai. [17]
On April 2019 Supplementary charge-sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate mentioned name of the three journalists including Shekhar Gupta with Raju Santhanam and Manu Pubby. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]

After a huge controversy and allegations of corruption, [24] [25] Defence Minister A.K. Antony, on 12 February, ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). [26] [27]

On 25 February 2013, CBI registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against 11 persons including the former Indian Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, and his cousins, besides four companies. [28] After carrying out the preliminary enquiry, the CBI found sufficient evidence and registered an FIR on 13 March. The FIR named 13 persons including: former Indian Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, his three brothers: Juli, Docsa and Sandeep, the brother of former Union minister Santosh Bagrodia, Satish Bagrodia, and Pratap Aggarwal (Chairman and Managing Director of IDS Infotech). The FIR also named four companies - Italy-based Finmeccanica, UK-based AgustaWestland and Chandigarh-based IDS Infotech and Aeromatrix. [29] [30]

In 2013, billionaire Indian arms dealer Abhishek Verma and his Romanian born wife Anca Neacsu were named suspects in this scandal. Abhishek had played the role of a middleman in the deal and had interfaced with the politicians in securing CCS clearance from the Cabinet Committee. This nexus was exposed by TimesNow TV with their global investigation. [31] [32] According to the investigators, part of the bribes from AgustaWestland was sent to Abhishek's companies Atlas Defence Systems [33] accounts in Mauritius, to Bermuda accounts of Atlas Group Ltd and the other part was diverted to his wife's front company in New York, Ganton Limited. [34] [35] These funds are suspected to have been sent to Indian politicians who were beneficiaries in this scandal. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had first identified the role of Abhishek Verma [36] and his wife Anca Neacsu [37] in 2013 in several of his blogs and press-releases. [38] [39] Later in April 2017, the Verma couple were exonerated from these allegations of corruption by CBI Special Court of Judge Anju Bajaj Chandana. [40]

In September 2015, a special CBI court issued an open non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Christian Michel based on a CBI report that he was needed to be questioned in the case to know how much amount he had received as ""commission"" in the deal. The CBI said that ""Based on this arrest warrant, Interpol India would be requested to issue a Red Corner Notice against Christian Michel James and execute said warrant."" [41] In an interview to a newspaper, he denied any wrongdoing by stating that he had never met any ""Gandhi"" in his life. [42]

Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating money laundering allegations. In March 2015, the ED traced and identified the properties worth around ? 1.12 crore owned by Christian Michel and issued a provisional attachment order. The ED claimed that Michel bought a flat in south Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave in the name of media firm Media Exim using the bribe money. He was also reportedly in possession of a luxury car and a Fixed Deposit of ? 54 lakh. In September 2015, the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment of properties and allowed the agency to retain the properties. [43] In September 2015, the ED attached assets worth about ? 7 crore alleged to be in the name of family members of ex-IAF Chief S. P. Tyagi. [44]

The CBI and the ED have sent letters rogatory to as many as eight countries including Italy, Tunisia, [45] Mauritius, the UAE, the UK, Switzerland, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands. [41] [46]

On 27 February 2013, UPA-II Government introduced a motion in Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) for an investigation led by a 30-member Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). The motion was passed after a walkout by most of the opposition parties like BJP, JD(U), Trinamool Congress, CPI, TDP and AGP. [47] [48] During the debate, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said the JPC was an ""exercise in futility"" and a ""diversionary tactic."" He argued that the case involved various legal aspects such as extradition of accused foreigners and custodial interrogation and the JPC can have ""none of these powers,"" leaving it ineffective. Many opposition members demanded Supreme Court-monitored investigation (on the similar lines of 2G spectrum case). Demands were also made to establish money trail and issue Letter Rogatory (LR). [47]

The UPA government initially denied all allegations and claimed it has ""nothing to hide"" and that ""our track record is not cover up."" [47]

Cancellation of the contract by the Indian Government[ edit ]

India cancelled the ? 3,600 crore deal with AgustaWestland in January 2014. The government cancelled the contract ""on grounds of breach of the Pre-contract Integrity Pact and the agreement by AWIL (AgustaWestland International Ltd)"". The contract was frozen in February 2013 after allegations surfaced that ?3.6 billion (equivalent to ?4.9 billion or US$69 million in 2019) was paid as a bribe. [49]

Decision-Makers[ edit ]

Senior officials involved in the decision-making process that led to the selection of the AgustaWestland helicopters for VVIP use were M. K. Narayanan (Indian Police Service (IPS), former Director Intelligence Bureau (India) and NSA); B V Wanchoo (IPS, and Chief of Special Protection Group); and Shashi Kant Sharma, IAS, and former defence secretary. [50] After their tenures at the centre, the UPA Government made M.K. Narayanan governor of West Bengal, B.V. Wanchoo governor of Goa and Shashikant Sharma Comptroller and Auditor General of India. [50]

CBI probe[ edit ]

The CBI approached Union Law Ministry to record statements of M. K. Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo in January 2014. [51] M.K Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo were West Bengal and Goa Governors respectively at the time of CBI's request. Their statements were considered vital as they were National Security Adviser and Special Protection Group (SPG) chief at the time of the signing of the contract with AgustaWestland. Their views were also considered before the Indian Government signed the contract with AgustaWestland. However, Kapil Sibal 's Union Law ministry stonewalled the CBI probe by rejecting CBI's request to examine them under the usual excuse of ""immunity."" The CBI, therefore, approached President Pranab Mukherjee to seek permission to examine ex-NSA and ex-chief of SPG. [52] M. K. Narayanan and B. V. Wanchoo were questioned by CBI later in June and July 2014 respectively. [53] [54]

Recovery of bank guarantee[ edit ]

After the cancellation of the contract, India encashed over ?2.5 billion (US$35 million) made by AgustaWestland as a bank guarantee in the Indian banks in January 2014. [55] Separately, India requested the Italian government to retrieve the bank guarantee amount made by the firm in Italian banks which was more than 275 million (? 23.64 billion). [56] [57] On 17 March 2014, a request made by India was rejected by an Italian court. [58] However, the appellate court in Milan reversed the lower court's judgement and upheld the claims of the Indian government. [59] Accordingly, in June 2014, the Indian government encashed ?18.18 billion (US$250 million), taking the total amount recovered so far to ?20.68 billion (US$290 million). [12] With this, India was reported to have recovered the entire amount of around ?16.2 billion (US$230 million) (45% of the total contract value ?36 billion (US$500 million)) it had paid to AgustaWestland. [13] However, it was later reported that AgustaWestland had not returned the entire amount, and kept 106 million for three helicopters it had delivered. [60]

Italian Court judgments[ edit ]

The Italian court, investigating the case in October 2014, acquitted ex-IAF Chief S.P. Tyagi of all corruption charges. [61] It also acquitted the former Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi and former AgustaWestland head Bruno Spagnolini of ""charges of international corruption"". The court, however, convicted and sentenced them to two years in prison on the lesser charge of ""false invoicing"" in the case. [62] On 8 April 2016, the Milan Court of Appeal, in a 225-page judgement, overturned the lower court verdict and sentenced Giuseppe Orsi to four years' imprisonment. [14] Then, on 16 December 2016, the Corte di Cassazione (Supreme Court) cancelled the Appeals Court guilty verdict, and ordered a retrial, referring the matter to a different Court of Appeal, always in Milan. [63] After nine months of proceedings, on 8 January 2018, the Milan Third Court of Appeals finally cleared the defendants and dismissed all charges, on grounds of insufficient evidence provided by the prosecution to support the allegations [8] The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassazione on 22 May 2019 after the Milan General Prosecutor's office failed to have a recourse supported by the Attorney General.",am
437,"A CONMAN who partied with Rihanna has been jailed for swindling investors out of £235,000 to fund his lavish lifestyle.

James Bufton, 26, posed as a successful stockbroker to fleece family and friends out of the cash.

7

He also conned £750,000 from taxpayers in a VAT fraud.

The shameless fraudster spent his ill-gotten gains on private helicopters, lap dancing clubs and gambling, a court has heard.

Bufton used a photo of him meeting Rihanna at an after-show party to build up his image as a high-living financial whiz-kid.

He mingled with the singer at a backstage VIP party following her show at O2 Arena - and boasted they got along so well she invited him to visit her in New York.

There is no suggestion Rihanna was involved in, or knew about, Bufton's activities.

The defendant told would-be investors he'd been trained by leading investment firm Goldman Sachs as he wined and dined them.

But a court heard the con unravelled after investors called in police.

Instead of being a high-flyer, investigators discovered callous Bufton had left his own aunt penniless after stealing his dying uncles life savings.

He also fleeced his then-girlfriend's parents, as well as a close family friend.

Prosecutor Timothy Evans said one of his victims described him as the lowest form of human being.

He said: They were all fair game. He took their money and spent it down the drain.

It seems to have made no difference to him whether these were close family, a dying man, a grieving widow, a family friend, his girlfriends parents, a businessman or someone he happened to meet in a club.

He developed a toolbox of dishonest techniques, using his persuasive manner, his fabricated successful persona, and forged and misleading documents to con anyone he could out of their own money.""

Anwar Nashishibi, mitigating, said his client was ""genuinely remorseful"" for his actions.

He told how Bufton had received threats and intimidation over his debts, including bricks thrown through his window.

The defendant's car was also set ablaze.

Bufton, of Newport, Gwent, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court, where he admitted fraud, VAT fraud and money laundering between 2013 and 2018, and was jailed for six years.

Judge Daniel Williams told the swindler: ""There were no depths that you were not prepared to stoop.

""You have no conscience or remorse for what you have done.""

Bufton will return to the court in the new year as prosecutors attempt to seize his assets as part of Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings.",am

According to court documents and evidence presented during the one-week trial, Lawrence Martin Birk founded a sole proprietorship, Tarryall River Log Homes LLC, in 2000. He ran the company, which sold and built log homes. For more than twenty years, Birk did not voluntarily pay federal income taxes. After the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began collection efforts, including visiting Birk at his home, he hired a tax firm to prepare eight years worth of delinquent tax returns. However, Birk concealed pertinent information from the tax firm, including over $400,000 of retirement distributions that he funneled through a sham company. After filing his tax returns, which omitted the retirement income, Birk did not pay what the returns claimed was due and owing. Instead, he sent the IRS threatening correspondence that espoused the frivolous tax arguments of known tax defier organizations, including the We The People foundation and the Tax Honesty movement.

After being notified that the IRS intended to seize money from his bank accounts for taxes owed, Birk took steps to shield his money against the IRS collection efforts. Immediately or shortly after depositing funds into his bank account, Birk purchased cashiers checks to reduce his balance and impede the IRS ability to seize the money. Birks outstanding tax liabilities, including taxes, interest, and penalties, were over $2 million for 1998 to 2005. He has not filed returns or made any tax payments for the 2006 through 2018 tax years.

439,"Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's elder brother Agrasian Gehlot skipped appearing before the Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday for questioning in a money-laundering case, citing health issues, officials said.

His son Anupam Gehlot, however, reached the agency office in Delhi and was questioned about his business links with a company promoted by his family, Anupam Krishi.

They said the agency also handed over a fresh summons for his father to appear before it on August 4 in connection with the money-laundering case linked to alleged financial irregularities in exporting fertiliser.

Agrasain Gehlot was asked by the central probe agency to depose before the investigating officer of the case on Wednesday in Delhi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Officials said Agrasain Gehlot cited some health issues and sought adjournment of the summons for sometime.

On July 22, the central agency raided Agrasain Gehlot's premises in Jodhpur and a few other places in connection with the case filed under the criminal charges of PMLA.

Officials had said that agency sleuths seized a number of documents during the raids and Agrasain Gehlot required to be confronted and questioned about his fertiliser business and about his associates.

Some other people involved in the case have also been summoned by the probe agency this week.

The raids came about after the agency filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), the ED equivalent of a police FIR, in a 2007-09 Customs department case registered for alleged irregularities in the procurement and export of subsidised Muriate of Potash (MOP) meant for farmers and investigation in this case was finalised in 2013.

The ED took cognisance of the Customs FIR and a July 13 charge sheet to press money-laundering charges to probe a ""smuggling syndicate"" allegedly run by Agrasain Gehlot, his firm Anupam Krishi and others, officials said.

The agency said the case pertains to fraudulent export of MOP in the guise of industrial salts to buyers based in Malaysia and Taiwan. The MOP is a restricted commodity for exports so that it is easily available to farmers in the country.

The ED action came at a time when a political slugfest was on between CM Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.

Pilot, a former Union minister, was sacked as Rajasthan deputy CM and PCC chief recently.

Responding to the raids, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had told reporters, ""Prime Minister Modi has created 'raid raj' in the country but we are not going to be scared.""

When the Centre's ""gimmicks"" failed to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan, ED raids started at the premises of Gehlot's elder brother, he had said.

Agency sources had said Agrasain Gehlot and his firm were slapped with over Rs 60 crore penalty by the Customs department for these alleged export irregularities in 2013.

It is alleged that Gehlot's company ""diverted"" 35,000 metric tonnes of MOP that had a value of Rs 130 crore in the international market.

The ED alleged Agrasain Gehlot, in his capacity as a dealer, was the custodian of the MOP and was ""solely responsible"" for its proper distribution to farmers, and his alleged connivance with the company Saraf Impex Pvt Ltd and others resulted in the diversion of MOP that was imported by Indian Potash Limited at a concessional rate of duty.",am
440,"The president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was charged on Thursday by Swiss federal prosecutors in connection with a wider bribery investigation linked to World Cup television rights.

The office of Switzerlands attorney general filed an indictment charging Khelaifi with inciting former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement. The Qatari football and television executive, however, no longer faces an accusation of bribery.

Following a three-year investigation, Fifa reached an amicable agreement with Khelaifi last month, prosecutors said, to drop its criminal complaint relating to the awarding of 2026 and 2030 World Cup rights to Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports. Khelaifi is the head of Doha-based BeIN Sports and also a member of the Uefa executive committee.

I have been cleared of all suspicions of bribery and the case has been dismissed definitively and conclusively, said Khelaifi in a statement. While a secondary technical charge remains outstanding, I have every expectation that this will be proven completely groundless.

While I have cooperated with all authorities during the legal process, the three year investigation has been characterised by constant leaks, misinformation and a seemingly relentless agenda to smear my reputation in the media  completely irrespective of the facts and the notion of due process. For that reason, I have requested the relevant Swiss authorities to open a criminal enquiry into the conduct of the investigation.

Khelaifi was indicted for his alleged part in providing Valcke, who had influence over the awarding of World Cup rights until being removed from office in 2015, with use of a luxury villa in Sardinia without paying rent valued at up to 1.8m. Valcke was charged with accepting bribes, several counts of aggravated criminal mismanagement and falsification of documents. Valcke has denied wrongdoing. In 2017 his lawyer said Valcke disputes all the allegations.

For the first time in the five-year investigation of Fifa business, Swiss prosecutors revealed that they believe Valcke received kickbacks totaling 1.25m to steer World Cup rights toward favoured broadcasters in Italy and Greece.

A third person who was not identified was charged with bribery over those payments and also for inciting Valcke to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement.

Khelaifi was appointed to the Uefa executive committee, representing European clubs, one year ago despite being implicated in the bribery case. He is also an influential board member of the European Club Association, which is seeking to drive reforms in the Champions League to favour elite clubs such as French champion PSG.

He denied wrongdoing after being questioned in 2017 and 2019 in connection with criminal proceedings opened three years ago.

Khelaifi has also been implicated in a separate corruption investigation by French prosecutors that is linked to Qatar seeking hosting rights for the track and field world championships. Doha hosted the 2019 edition.",am
441,"KUALA LUMPUR, MalaysiaFormer Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and fined nearly $50 million by a Malaysian court that found him guilty of abuse of power in connection with one of the worlds largest financial scandals that resulted in his defeat in the countrys 2018 elections.

The sentence is to run concurrently with shorter prison terms of 10 years for each of the three charges of money laundering and three charges of criminal breach of trust against him, the court said.

Tuesdays verdict marks the first in a string of cases against Mr. Najib over allegations he unlawfully received hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB, which he launched in 2009 to spur his countrys economy.

Mr. Najib pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in a short statement before the court Tuesday. Proceedings lasted all day and were closely watched in the Southeast Asian country where Mr. Najib continues to wield political influence. His lawyer said Mr. Najib would appeal the decision before a higher court.

More than $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen between 2009 and 2014 by people who worked for the fund, government officials and others. U.S. authorities have said money siphoned from 1MDB was used to finance Hollywood films and buy luxury real estate.",am
442,"José Mourinho has been given a one-year suspended prison sentence and agreed to pay 2.2m (£1.9m) in fines after admitting tax fraud while he was the manager of Real Madrid.

The former Manchester United manager appeared at Madrids provincial court on Tuesday, where he confirmed a plea deal over charges that he had defrauded the Spanish tax authorities of 3.3m by failing to declare revenues from image rights in 2011 and 2012.

Prosecutors had accused Mourinho, 56, of using offshore companies in Ireland, the British Virgin Islands and New Zealand to conceal his earnings while resident in Spain. All these corporate structures were used by the accused in order to hide the profits from his image rights, read a court document.

Mourinhos deal with the tax authorities will see him pay 1.9m  60% of the amount defrauded  plus an additional 121,764 in interest. He is also paying a 182,500 fine in exchange for serving no jail time. Sentences of less than two years for first-time offenders are usually suspended in Spain.

Following a court appearance in Madrid during November 2017, Mourinho claimed that the case against him had concluded.

I left Spain in 2013 with the information and the conviction that my tax situation was perfectly legal, Mourinho said at the time.

A couple of years later I was informed that an investigation had been opened. They told me that to regularise my situation I had to pay X amount. I didnt answer, I didnt argue, I paid, I signed the papers with the state that show my conformity and that everything is definitively closed.

Mourinho is the latest high-profile person in the football world to find himself facing tax-evasion charges in Spain.

Last month Cristiano Ronaldo admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an 18.8m fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.

The Portugal and Juventus footballer, Ronaldo, 33, had been accused of defrauding the authorities of 14.8m (£12.9m) in unpaid taxes between 2011 and 2014.

Madrids regional state prosecutor alleged Ronaldo had used what it deemed to be a shell company in the Virgin Islands to create a screen in order to hide his total income from Spains tax office.

It said Ronaldo intentionally did not declare income of 28.4m (£25m) related to image rights, and declared 11.5m of earnings from 2011-14 when his real income was almost 43m.

Ronaldos former teammate at Real Madrid Xabi Alonso is accused of defrauding tax authorities of about 2m from 2010-12.

If found guilty he could be sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 4m, in addition to the amount allegedly defrauded. Again, though, he would be unlikely to go to prison. The charges are related to Alonsos income from image rights. The retired Spain midfielder, who has denied any wrongdoing, played for Madrid from 2009-14.

In July 2016 Lionel Messi and his father, Jorge, were sentenced to 21 months in prison after a Catalan court found they had evaded tax on the players image rights, with more than 4m owed in back payments.

The suspended sentences were later replaced with fines.",am
443,"A former procurement officer at a Petróleos de Venezuela SA subsidiary has pleaded guilty to an alleged role in a bribery scheme and a former Citgo manager has been indicted on money-laundering charges in the latest developments in a sprawling U.S. probe into alleged corruption at Venezuelas state-owned energy company.

Lennys Rangel, previously head of procurement at Petrocedeno SA, a PdVSA joint venture with two European oil companies, was accused of conspiring to launder millions in bribe payments through the U.S., including by purchasing a condominium in Miami, according to a complaint filed by prosecutors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Ms. Rangel pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the U.S., according to a plea agreement filed last week.

Felipe Jaramillo, a lawyer who represents Ms. Rangel, declined to comment. Efforts to reach PdVSA for comment werent successful.

U.S. prosecutors alleged that bribes were paid to Ms. Rangel and other executives to help secure contracts for Petrocedeno, an oil producer, according to the complaint. The charge against Ms. Rangel was unsealed in March.

Her plea is among the latest in an investigation into alleged bribery at PdVSA. At least 27 people have been charged in related cases and most have pleaded guilty, according to the U.S. Justice Department.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department said it had charged former Citgo Petroleum Corp. procurement officer Jose Luis De Jongh Atencio with one count of conspiracy to launder money and five counts of money laundering.

Mr. De Jongh worked in the Houston-based subsidiary of PdVSAs special projects group and from about 2013 through at least 2019 agreed to accept more than $2.5 million in bribe payments from businessmen Jose Manuel Gonzalez Testino and Tulio Anibal Farias Perez and others, the Justice Department said.

In exchange, Mr. De Jongh helped the businessmen procure contracts with Citgo and PdVSA, the department said.

Dane Ball, a Smyser Kaplan & Veselka LLP lawyer representing Mr. De Jongh, declined to comment. He said Mr. De Jongh had pleaded not guilty.

Messrs. Gonzalez and Farias entered guilty pleas on alleged violations of U.S. antibribery laws and other charges in connection with the case, prosecutors said. Lawyers for Messrs. Gonzalez and Farias declined to comment.

Mr. De Jongh directed bribe payments from the businessmen to be made to bank accounts in the names of shell companies in Panama and Switzerland and then laundered bribe proceeds through U.S. bank accounts and used most of the funds to buy real estate in Texas, according to the Justice Department.

He also allegedly received gifts such as tickets to major sporting events and concerts from the businessmen, the department said.

These prosecutions are the most recent examples of the continued commitment of the criminal division to rooting out the rampant corruption that has plagued Venezuela for years, said Brian Rabbitt, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Departments criminal division. This corruption undermines the rule of law and threatens our national security.",am
444,"Germanys troubled Deutsche Bank faces fines, legal action and the possible prosecution of senior management because of its role in a $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme, a confidential internal report seen by the Guardian says.

The bank admits there is a high risk that regulators in the US and UK will take significant disciplinary action against it. Deutsche concedes that the scandal has hurt its global brand  and is likely to cause client attrition, loss of investor confidence and a decline in its market value.

Deutsche Bank was embroiled in a vast money-laundering operation, dubbed the Global Laundromat. Russian criminals with links to the Kremlin, the old KGB and its main successor, the FSB, used the scheme between 2010 and 2014 to move money into the western financial system. The cash involved could total $80bn, detectives believe.

Shell companies typically based in the UK loaned money to each other. Companies then defaulted on this large fictitious debt. Corrupt judges in Moldova authenticated the debt  with billions transferred to Moldova and the Baltics via a bank in Latvia.

Deutsche Bank was used to launder the money via its corresponding banking network  effectively allowing illegal Russian payments to be funnelled to the US, the European Union and Asia.

The bank was entirely unaware of the scam until the Guardian and Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) broke the story in March 2017, the report says. The first it knew was an email from the Guardian and Germanys Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper asking for comment.

Only with this intelligence received is it now possible for Deutsche Bank to start global investigations, it notes.

In the embarrassing aftermath, the bank asked two in-house financial crime investigators  Philippe Vollot and Hinrich Völcker  to find out what had gone wrong. Their nine-page presentation was shared last year with the audit committee of the banks supervisory board and is marked strictly confidential.

The pair identified numerous high-risk entities. They included 1,244 in the US, 329 in the UK and 950 in Germany. These entities were responsible for nearly 700,000 transactions, the report says, involving at least £62m in the UK, $47m in the US, and 55m in Germany.

As part of its investigation, Deutsche Bank sent 149 suspicious activity reports to the National Crime Agency in London. Similar disclosures of potential money-laundering transactions were made to authorities in the US and elsewhere  with 30 private and corporate Deutsche Bank clients reported. Some may have been unknowingly used, the report says.

The affair is a further blow to Deutsche Bankss ailing reputation. It comes amid police raids on its Frankfurt HQ over the Panama Papers, a plunging share price and talks over a possible merger with Germanys Commerzbank. The raid last November came after German prosecutors alleged two bank employees helped clients launder money via offshore firms.

Deutsche is also under scrutiny in Washington over its financial dealings with Donald Trump. On 15 April, Democrats from the House intelligence and financial services committees issued a subpoena, demanding the bank provide documents about its lending to the president.

Over two decades, Trump borrowed more than $2bn from Deutsche. In 2008, he defaulted on a $45m loan repayment and sued the bank. Its private wealth division in New York subsequently loaned Trump a further $300m  a move that bemused insiders and which has yet to be fully explained.

In recent years, the bank has had a series of bruising encounters with international regulators. Between 2011 and 2018, it paid $14.5bn in fines, with exposure to dubious Russian money a regular theme.

In 2017, the UKs Financial Conduct Authority imposed its largest fine  £163m  after Deutsche carried out a $10bn mirror trade  scheme run out of its branch in Moscow. The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined the bank $425m over the same case, in which roubles were converted into dollars via fake trades on behalf of VIP Russian clients.

Deutsche carried out an internal investigation into the mirror trades affair, Project Square. The leaked Global Laundromat report says there is no systematic link between the two Russian money-laundering schemes. However, it suggests some overlap. Two unnamed entities feature in both and 46 mirror trade entities directly transacted with 233 laundromat ones.

The leaked report says Deutsche has cleaned up its act. It says it has stopped doing business with the two banks at the centre of the Laundromat scandal  Moldovas Moldindconbank and Latvias Trasta Komercbanka. Regulators in Latvia closed down Trasta in 2016 because of serial money-laundering violations.

Deutsche Bank says it has reduced its footprint across the post-Soviet region. It no longer has relationships with any banks in Moldova, Latvia, Estonia and Cyprus, the report says. All are favourite destinations for illicit Moscow money. The bank has scaled down its business activities in Russia and Ukraine, it says.

The bank is under investigation for its role in Europes biggest banking scandal, involving Denmarks Danske Bank. Danske laundered 200bn (£178bn) of Russian money via its branch in Estonia. Deutsche provided correspondent banking services via its US subsidiary.

Deutsche Bank said it could not comment on potential or ongoing investigations, or on any matters regarding our regulators. It said it was committed to providing appropriate information to all authorised investigations.

The bank said: We have considerably increased staff numbers in anti-financial crime and more than tripled our staff since 2015. Since 2016 we have invested 700m in upgrading our key control functions there.",am
445,"The chief executive of one of Sweden's largest banks was fired Thursday in the wake of allegations that the bank was connected to a massive money laundering scandal in the Baltic countries. It is the second major Nordic bank CEO to fall over the scandal in four months.

Swedbank Chairman Lars Idermark said that the CEO, Birgitte Bonnesen, was fired by the board after ""developments during the past days (that) have created an enormous pressure for the bank."" CFO Anders Karlsson was named as acting chief executive.

The decision came a day after Sweden's Economic Crime Authority raided the banks' headquarters near Stockholm. Prosecutors are investigating whether 15 of Swedbank's largest shareholders illegally received information about the bank's connection to the money laundering scandal before the issue was made public by a Swedish television report last month.

Authorities in the United States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are also investigating Swedbank over the alleged dirty money flows. Trading in Swedbank shares was suspended temporarily on Thursday on the Stockholm stock exchange.

Bonnesen is the second top executive to fall over money laundering cases involving Scandinavian banks and their branches in the Baltic countries.

In December, the chief executive of Danske Bank, Thomas Borgen, resigned after an internal investigation found that some 200 billion euros ($225 billion) flowing through the bank's Estonian subsidiary from 2007 to 2015 was suspicious. Reports alleged that some of the money flows were from family members of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The findings prompted Denmark's financial regulator to reopen a probe and Danish prosecutors have started a criminal investigation.

Swedish television reported last month that Swedbank customers had been able to funnel at least 40 billion kronor ($4.3 billion) between Swedbank and Danske Bank's Estonian unit.

Swedbank entered the Baltic banking market in 2005 through the acquisition of the Estonia-based AS Hansapank, a commercial and retail bank set up in 1992 and operating also in neighboring Latvia, Lithuania and Russia under the brand of Hansabank .

Just ahead of the Swedbank transaction, Hansapank acquired Moscow-based OAO Kvest Bank in 2005.

Along with SEB Bank  another Swedish banking group  Swedbank remains one of the two main commercial banks in the Baltics, having a market share of 25-35 percent in deposits and loans in each country.

At its peak a few years ago, over 90 percent of Estonia's banking industry was held by Nordic, mainly Sweden-based banks.

446,"On July 31, Daniel Kamensky composed a six-word Bloomberg chat message that ruined his life.

What drove him to do so  and then pushed him to make the string of decisions, each more reckless than the last, that exponentially compounded his troubles over the next few hours  remains a mystery. But one thing is now clear: Those decisions, made between 3:20 and 8:08 p.m. on a single late-summer day, amounted to four criminal fraud charges and the apparent end of a brilliant Wall Street career.

This was not how Dan Kamenskys story was supposed to turn out. The son of a corporate lawyer who had founded his own firm outside Chicago, Kamensky graduated with bachelors and law degrees from Georgetown. He started his career as a bankruptcy attorney at a white-shoe law firm before becoming a major player on the distressed-debt team at Lehman Brothers. He then jumped to Paulson & Co., once one of the most prominent hedge funds in the industry. In 2016, Kamensky founded his own distressed-debt hedge fund firm, Marble Ridge Capital, and grew assets from $17 million on day one to $1 billion at the peak. His wedding made The New York Times, and he lived a life of suburban comfort on Long Island with his wife and daughter. In the hard-knuckle world of bankruptcy and restructurings, he minted a reputation as a talented, aggressive negotiator who sometimes rubbed people the wrong way but was ultimately fair.

That changed at 6:00 a.m. on September 3, when federal agents stormed into his Roslyn home and arrested Kamensky on four counts of criminal fraud: securities fraud, wire fraud, extortion and bribery, and obstruction of justice. The U.S. Department of Justice accused him of abusing his fiduciary duty as a member of the unsecured creditors committee serving in the bankruptcy proceedings of upscale department store chain Neiman Marcus.

Kamensky, the government alleged in its complaint, tried to use his position as a member of that committee and as a client of Wall Street investment bank Jefferies to keep the bank from making a rival offer for shares of a Neiman Marcus entity that Marble Ridge  which held Neiman Marcus bonds and term loans  wanted to buy. Then, the government alleges, he attempted to cover up what hed done.

For some who knew Kamensky, the news was stunning.

I believed he was one of the best distressed-debt investors in the business. Hes very smart, hes extremely rigorous in doing his due diligence, he works very hard, and he used his legal background and general knowledge of bankruptcy to his tremendous advantage and success, says one person who has discussed bankruptcy and restructuring matters with Kamensky in the past. I was shocked beyond belief, extremely upset; I am still now. Its inexplicable to me, what I read in the press. Inexplicable and completely out of character.

But others who knew Kamensky in the past say that even in the bankruptcy world  one in which creditors must be willing to fight for every dollar of assets that remains to be recovered  Kamensky stood out.

I think he was a little more aggressive than most, says someone who has worked with him. At the time that he joined Paulson, he was at the top of the investing world. He had a lot of clout and heft and credibility behind him, and he used it  to the point where he would even upset other people who were on his side.

Says someone else who once worked with Kamensky, When I heard this news, I wasnt shocked. Not that I ever thought that he was the kind of guy who was going to break the law, but he was a bulldog, like other players in the distressed space. I felt bad that he crossed the line and it blew up like this, but it definitely was not out of left field.

A spokesperson for Marble Ridge refutes this characterization. Dan as a professional is somebody who would be aggressive in trying to assert his investment interests. If you look at the world of hedge funds and distressed investing, its replete with examples of people you could argue are more aggressive, says Robert Siegfried, vice chairman of public relations firm Kekst.

Others agree with that perspective, saying they do not see Kamensky as being any more brutal than what is typical for distressed-debt investors.

But all of Kamenskys professional contacts who were interviewed for this story say he is a smart and talented investor. And, to a person, they expressed regret for how his story turned out.

I like Dan; I think hes a smart guy, says someone else who has worked with him on bankruptcy and restructuring situations. He can be a pain in the ass in terms of being demanding and aggressive, but with me he was utterly and always respectful. What happened is the furthest thing that I ever, ever, ever would have expected.

Although those actions on July 31 undid Kamenskys career in a matter of hours, they were ultimately the culmination of a bitter dispute between Marble Ridge and Neiman Marcus that had been dragging on since 2018. Thats when Marble Ridge accused Neiman Marcus and its owners  private equity firm Ares and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  of fraudulently transferring the store chains MyTheresa subsidiary, a German luxury online retailer valued at an estimated $1 billion, out of the reach of creditors and back to an entity they controlled. A person familiar with the situation says the transfer was permitted by Neiman Marcuss debt documents. (CPPIB and Ares both declined to comment for this story, and Neiman Marcus did not respond to requests for comment.)

The parties went back and forth in various courts. Then, in May 2020, Neiman Marcus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of those proceedings, the companys owners reached a settlement this summer with the unsecured creditors, including Marble Ridge, allocating 140 million Series B shares of MyTheresa to them. But the shares were highly illiquid, and some of the unsecured creditors, particularly vendors that had supplied Neiman Marcus with merchandise they had yet to be paid for, needed cash. Marble Ridge submitted a proposal to fellow members of the committee in which it would offer to buy up to 60 million of the shares at 20 cents on the dollar from any creditors that wanted instant liquidity. The committee voted to support the settlement and agreed to continue negotiating the cash-out proposal with Marble Ridge.

The catalyst for Kamenskys unraveling came on July 30. Thats when a senior analyst for Jefferies distressed and special-situations group, Eric Geller, found out about the MyTheresa shares being distributed to unsecured creditors. That day a Jefferies client contacted him to express an interest in buying the shares, according to a report from the U.S. Trustee, filed in a Texas bankruptcy court in August. (A person familiar with the bankruptcy proceedings says that up to this point, Jefferies had not been involved in the Neiman Marcus bankruptcy at all  and only learned that the MyTheresa shares were for sale from another hedge fund that had previously been bidding with Marble Ridge. A related SEC complaint says Jefferies learned of the sale from an industry newsletter and the bankruptcy docket. The bank declined to comment.)

Geller then sent texts to two other Jefferies employees  one of whom is identified in the report as Jefferies Employee 1 but was later reported by Bloomberg to be Joe Femenia, a former Navy SEAL who headed distressed-debt trading at the bank  to discuss making an offer for the shares. Femenia woke up to those texts on the morning of July 31 and talked to Geller at 8:00 a.m. Femenia had heard from two separate clients that morning who were interested in purchasing the MyTheresa shares. Femenia thought there was enough interest for Jefferies to move forward with its own proposal.

Sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., Geller called the unsecured creditors committees financial adviser, turnaround veteran Mohsin Meghji, and told him Jefferies wanted to make an offer for the shares in the 30s  substantially higher than the offer that Marble Ridge had submitted. Geller sent the adviser a follow-up email confirming the offer and asking that it be kept confidential. At about a quarter after noon, Femenia began putting together a formal bid to buy the shares from any unsecured creditor that wanted to sell.

Meghji and Richard Pachulski, the committees lawyer, then decided they needed to halt work on finalizing the Marble Ridge proposal  and that they needed to tell Kamensky why. (Pachulski later said he did not remember being told that Jefferies wanted the bid to be confidential.) They called Kamensky at 3:15 to tell him about the Jefferies offer.

According to the Trustees report, Mr. Kamensky received this news calmly, without apparent anger or surprise. He believed Jefferies offer was not serious and nothing would come of it; he stated that Jefferies was likely just fishing for information.

In reality, Kamensky was seething. As soon as he got off the phone, he fired off an urgent message to Marble Ridges head trader.

Eric Geller from Jefferies called the [unsecured creditors committee] counsel and offered to buy the units at 30 cents, that is a monumental mistake, he wrote. Im getting [Femenia] now, he needs to talk to me. Let me know. They are threatening to put a bid in. The trader responded, Those guys man I hope they were just ignorant to our interests.

At 3:20, Kamensky sent an urgent Bloomberg chat to Femenia. Need you NOW, he wrote. The two exchanged messages, with Femenia telling Kamensky he was on a call and asking if he could get back to him in ten minutes. Do I need to reach out to Geller, wrote Kamensky. At 3:28 a clearly agitated Kamensky typed, DO NOT SEND IN A BID.

Seventeen minutes later, Kamensky got on the phone with Femenia and Geller. Femenia later reported that Kamensky was very upset and told them they did not understand the depth of his interest in the MyTheresa shares. He had racked up $3.5 million in legal fees for his efforts, which ultimately made the MyTheresa settlement possible, he insisted. In his own words  later recounted in an interview with the Trustee  Kamensky admitted that, in his fury, he began to shout, curse, and demand that Jefferies stand down. In his mind, he was going to have the MyTheresa shares come hell or high water; all the Jefferies bid would do is drive up his final price.

And then he made a threat. He told Femenia that Marble Ridge had been a good partner to him and Jefferies, but that if Jefferies moved forward with its bid for the MyTheresa shares, they would not be partners going forward, according to the Trustees report.

In other words, Marble Ridge was a valued Jefferies client  and Kamensky had just threatened to pull its business if the bank didnt withdraw its bid for the MyTheresa shares.

Kamensky later recalled in the Trustee interview that Femenia had then asked him why he was so angry. At this point, Kamensky began to regain his composure. The rest of the call was much less tense, with Kamensky laying out his long history with Neiman Marcus and the complexity of the negotiations for the MyTheresa shares. He told the Trustee that by the end of the call, he was convinced that Geller and Femenia would consider their next steps in light of the information he had provided in the calm latter half of the call, not the coercive statements he made in the angry first half of the call, the report said. Kamensky said he was trying to tell them that Jefferies should make a bid only if it was a serious bidder, but should back out if it wasnt so that it wouldnt disrupt the bankruptcy process.

But thats not what he actually said, according to Femenia. After they hung up with Kamensky, Femenia told Geller he was uncomfortable with what had just happened  in his view, Kamensky was abusing his position as a fiduciary in the bankruptcy case. So at 3:55 p.m., he called Jefferies general counsel and told him about the conversation.

Based on that conversation, the Jefferies professionals made a two-part decision: First, they would withdraw their bid to buy the MyTheresa shares. Second, they would tell all parties involved why they were withdrawing the bid  a move, it seemingly went without saying, that would sink Kamensky.

At a few minutes after 4:00, Femenia and Geller called Kamensky. They explained that he was an important client and that they intended to withdraw from making any bid for the shares. And then they told him they would be transparent about why  with both the client who had wanted to buy the shares and with the committees advisers, according to the Trustees report. Kamensky thanked the two men and told them he would always be grateful to them.

After they hung up, Geller observed that Kamensky appeared not to hear or understand the part about how they were going to tell the committee why they were withdrawing their bid.

He was right. Kamensky sent Bloomberg chat messages to Marble Ridges head trader after the call, telling him, They are standing down, and that Jefferies took the high road.

In the meantime, Femenia and Geller told their client they were pulling the bid. Then Geller emailed Pachulski and Meghji at the creditors committee, asking them to call him. Pachulski spoke with Geller at about 5:00 p.m.; Geller told him that Jefferies was withdrawing its bid and explained why. After the call, Pachulski told Meghji what Geller had said and set up a conference call for 6:00 that evening with the committee members to decide what to do about Kamenskys actions.

On that call, the committee members decided to reach out to an attorney for Marble Ridge, to find out if what Jefferies had told them was accurate. The attorney for Marble Ridge said he hadnt heard anything about it but that he would call them back after he spoke with Kamensky.

At 7:30 p.m. the attorney called Pachulski and other members of the committee and said that Kamensky had contacted Jefferies about the bid, but claimed that there was a misunderstanding about his intention. Pachulski said he would need to schedule an emergency meeting of the committee  without Marble Ridge or its attorneys  to figure out what to do next.

By then, Kamensky was in full panic mode. He sent Femenia a Bloomberg chat message at 7:42 p.m., asking to speak with him. Kamensky and Femenia had a phone conversation a few minutes after 8:00.

This conversation never happened, Kamensky said, according to the report. Femenia, alarmed by this declaration, began to record the call  and later provided a copy of it to the Trustee.

And then Kamensky began to dig an even deeper hole.

Why would you tell committee counsel that I threatened you? he asked. Why would you tell them that? . . . This is going to the U.S. Attorneys Office. This is going to go [to] the court. Like, do you want to be dragged into this? Like, bid all you want but dont  dont  dont put me in jail.

Kamensky said he informed the committee that he had simply told Jefferies not to bid if it wasnt serious but to go ahead if it was, and that he planned to maintain that it was a humongous misunderstanding.

According to Femenia, there was no misunderstanding.

Help me out here, Kamensky pleaded. I mean, like, talk to me here, talk to me. How do we salvage this?

When it became clear that Femenia would not cover for him, Kamensky lost what was left of his cool.

[I]f youre going to continue to tell them what you just told me, Im going to jail, okay? he snapped. Because theyre going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right? Maybe I should go to jail. But Im asking you not to put me in jail.

Dan, I would never lie for anyone, okay, like 100 percent clear because that in and of itself is a crime and I have ethics, Femenia shot back, according to the complaint.

Just so you know, Im not asking you to lie, okay, and all Im saying is that if thats what I said thats not at all what I intended, and I apologize, okay? Kamensky said. Im not asking you to lie. . . . Maybe you can see your way to saying that it was misconstrued . . . thats all Im saying . . . and this conversation could not have happened.

The next morning, at 8:31  ahead of an emergency committee meeting scheduled for 2:00 that afternoon  Marble Ridges attorney emailed the committees lawyer and advised him that Marble Ridge was resigning from the committee. At that emergency meeting the committee decided to tell the U.S. Trustee overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings what Kamensky had done. That same day, Jefferies determined it would go ahead with its bid for the MyTheresa shares. (Marble Ridge later submitted a revised proposal.)

Two days later the committee filed a letter to an attorney for the U.S. Trustee laying out the facts of the Kamensky saga. A month after that, Kamensky was arrested.

People who know Kamensky say he was tremendously invested in the Neiman Marcus situation  financially, professionally, and emotionally.

In Kamenskys view, the transfer of the MyTheresa assets back to Neiman Marcus  jointly owned by Ares and CPPIB, the companys equity sponsors and controlling shareholders  rendered Neiman Marcus insolvent, making it a clear-cut example of a fraudulent conveyance, done simply to strip an important and valuable asset away from the creditors of the company and to gift that asset to Ares and CPPIB, according to a letter Kamensky sent to the company in September 2018. At the time, Marble Ridge owned bonds and term loans in the retailer, and has described itself as the companys largest unsecured creditor.

The dispute heated up in December 2018, when Marble Ridge filed a lawsuit against Neiman Marcus and related entities in Dallas County court; the suit was eventually dismissed on the grounds that Marble Ridge didnt have legal standing to bring the claim.

When Neiman Marcus ultimately filed for bankruptcy, a report commissioned by the unsecured creditors committee concluded that Neiman Marcus was insolvent at the time of the MyTheresa transfer. A counterreport from Ares and CPPIB disputed this assertion and others in the report. But the so-called disinterested manager appointed by Neiman Marcus, partly to investigate the transaction, concluded that there is a strong possibility that the Company was insolvent at the time of the Distribution  meaning at the time the MyTheresa asset was transferred. (A person familiar with the bankruptcy proceedings says that conclusion is not supported by analysis and notes that no courts have upheld any of Marble Ridges claims.)

I think Dan was by and large vindicated, says one of the people who has worked with him. He was increasingly focused on proving that he was right, and he saw it as a great opportunity to establish a name for himself and his firm and to hold people accountable.

But there was another reason, this person says. There was an element, mentally, of entitlement because he had spent years chasing these guys. The person notes that Kamensky had pointed to the $3.5 million he spent on fees. Its not easy to do what he did. There was an element of him thinking, I did this, so I should be somehow compensated.

Of course, thats not how unsecured creditors committees work. In bankruptcy proceedings the job of an unsecured creditors committee is to maximize the potential recovery of assets for the benefit of everyone on the committee. Indeed, it has a fiduciary duty to do so. For some committee members this may run headlong into their own interests.

If youre a bidder in a bankruptcy case, you have to understand the debtor is trying to maximize the value of the estate for the benefit of creditors, and that means getting an active auction process going, explains Stephen Lubben, the Harvey Washington Wiley chair in corporate governance and business ethics at Seton Hall University. Anything you do to discourage an active auction process is problematic, but to discourage it when you are on an unsecured creditors committee seems to be especially problematic.

Kamensky, a bankruptcy lawyer by training, certainly knew this.

When the U.S. Trustee interviewed him after the fact, Kamensky came clean immediately. He told the Trustee that his Bloomberg messages to Geller and Femenia were motivated by panic. He was afraid that any potential Jefferies bid would disrupt the process of including a cash-out proposal in a plan that the committee had to file to the court by August 3, which he believed was a firm deadline.

When Jefferies told him that it was going to put in the bid, Kamensky told the Trustee, his panic turned to fury, because he thought that Jefferies was shaking him down for half the available assets by barging into a situation they knew nothing about at a sensitive time. Kamensky also conceded that contacting Jefferies and trying to keep the bank from submitting its own bid was wholly inappropriate and a grave mistake. But he denied asking Femenia to lie. Rather, he told the Trustee, he was trying to manage the message by talking with him, and that he hoped they could find common ground.

People who knew Kamensky may hold differing views about his approach  but until the Jefferies saga, he had a reputation for being a smart investor, a devoted family man, and a philanthropist who gave generously to Jewish causes. In addition to his philanthropic work, Kamensky was a leader in the UJA Federations Bankruptcy and Reorganization Group and has appeared as a speaker at the American Bankruptcy Institutes annual conference.

Im not going to comment other than to say hes a wonderful human being and a good person, and thats all Im going to tell you, said Saul Burian, a managing director in Houlihan Lokeys financial restructuring group, when reached by phone.

According to Siegfried, the Marble Ridge spokesperson, He wasnt thinking. He let his emotions and his panic get a hold of him, and that allowed him to cloud his judgment in making the calls to Jefferies. That really is what happened, and that is what hes said has happened to the Trustee, and that is what he apologized to the court for. What you had is this series of very inappropriate and unfortunate conversations that occurred between Dan and Jefferies at the 11th hour and 59th minute. But no one knows whether creditors were actually harmed by that. They werent at the time the conversations occurred. Marble Ridge argues that the real financial harm was done earlier, with the MyTheresa transfer, notes Siegfried.

One day after Kamenskys arrest, a Houston bankruptcy judge approved Neiman Marcuss reorganization plan.

As for Kamensky, he faces several years in prison, as well as civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Marble Ridge is in the process of winding down. And a once promising career has turned into a cautionary tale.

There is a slippery slope, warns an observer. And the heat of the moment can be combustible.",nam
447,"HSBC has been ordered to pay a record 40m Swiss francs (£28m) and been given a final warning by the Geneva authorities for organisational deficiencies which allowed money laundering to take place in the banks Swiss subsidiary.

The settlement means the Swiss will not prosecute HSBC or publish the findings of their investigation into alleged aggravated money laundering. But Genevas chief prosecutor, Olivier Jornot, cautioned that the bank was on notice, saying: This is an excuse which will only apply once.

Announcing the biggest financial penalty ever imposed by the Geneva authorities, Jornot launched a stinging attack on his own countrys financial laws, adding his voice to a growing a number of Swiss politicians and campaigners calling for reform of the countrys secretive banking system.

This matter shows the weakness of Swiss law in the matter of entry of criminal funds into the financial system, said Jornot.

When we have a law that doesnt punish financial intermediaries accepting doubtful funds then we have a problem. This problem dates from long before the HSBC affair.

HSBC agreed to the settlement after being notified of the charges being prepared against it at a private meeting on 10 April following which, prosecutors claimed, the bank rapidly agreed to begin negotiations over financial damages for past illegal acts.

The Geneva authorities said the payment, which is being described as compensation rather than a fine, reflected the harm done to the city and the profits obtained by HSBC from processing illicit funds.

The investigation was prompted, Jornot said, by revelations in the Guardian, the BBC, Le Monde and other media coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. This showed that HSBCs Swiss arm banked the proceeds of political corruption and accepted deposits from arms dealers while helping wealthy people evade taxes.

On 18 February, Jornot ordered a raid on HSBCs Geneva offices, a day after Switzerlands federal prosecutor, Michael Lauber, had told the press there was no call for an inquiry into wrongdoing at the bank. Lauber had argued it was not appropriate for the state to launch an investigation into HSBC based on stolen information.

Wrongdoing at HSBC was exposed after an IT worker at the bank, Hervé Falciani, leaked details about its Swiss accounts. The documents ended up in the hands of the French government in December 2008 and were distributed to the tax authorities of other nations, including the UK, before being leaked to Le Monde.

HSBCs Swiss arm is still facing investigations by US, French and Belgian authorities. Belgium said on Tuesday it was hoping to recover £390m in unpaid taxes from citizens who had hidden funds in undeclared Swiss accounts.

Meanwhile, Switzerland is pursuing Falciani. It has issued an international arrest warrant, but the French authorities have refused to extradite him. A Swiss court is preparing to try the Falciani in absentia.

Jornots investigators focused on HSBCs compliance team, which was responsible for ensuring its bankers followed the law. They seized files and emails on some 20 customers and internal audits from 2004 to 2014.

The research focused on four money laundering cases: one involving sales of cannabis, another concerning merchandise from Chinese triad counterfeiters in Spain, and a third involving an unnamed Mexican well known to certain cartels. The fourth case had been exposed by the Swissleaks investigation, coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The evidence was enough for the Swiss authorities to conclude that organisational failings at the bank were to blame for money-laundering violations.

The settlement does not cover employees. At the press conference, prosecutors referenced a former HSBC manager, Judah el-Maleh, who is believed to have fled to Israel. He ran HSBC Suisses Mediterranean, Europe and Israel desk, which was shut down after claims it had been involved in a cash pipeline in which money from the sale of marijuana in the Paris suburbs was couriered to HSBCs respectable clients in the French capital. Bank accounts back in Switzerland were manipulated to reimburse the drug dealers.

In a statement, HSBC said: The investigation conducted by the public prosecutor of the canton of Geneva into HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) has been formally closed today. The investigation found that neither the bank nor its employees are suspected of any current criminal offences.

The Geneva prosecutor acknowledges the progress the bank has made in recent years, including the improvements in its compliance function, internal processes and technology.

HSBC claims to have undergone a radical transformation, with initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money. The repositioning has reduced its client base by almost 70%, from about 30,000 accounts in 2007 to some 10,000 in 2014.

Explaining the decision not to bring HSBC to court, Jornot said Swiss law demanded a high standard of proof. Those laundering money had to be shown to be doing so deliberately, not accidentally, and the money had to be demonstrably obtained from criminal acts, not simply deposited by a known criminal. To fine the bank, prosecutors would also have needed to show organisational failure caused the money to be laundered.

In addition, many of the revelations in Falcianis data, which gave a detailed picture of events at the bank between 2005 and 2007, concerned older accounts or people who were no longer clients of the bank.

Nonetheless, Jornot stressed that the evidence showed HSBC has suffered from organisational failings which were to blame for the money laundering which occurred.",am
448,"The former French presidential hopeful François Fillon will stand trial for embezzlement in the aftermath of a fake jobs scandal that destroyed his political career.

Fillon, 65, who was on track to lead France in 2017, will appear in court with his Welsh-born wife, Penelope.

They will deny accusations of misusing more than 1m (£840,000) of state money to pay Mrs Fillon in an allegedly non-existent role as the presidential candidates parliamentary assistant.

The claims left Fillons political hopes and a public career spanning 35 years in tatters, changing the course of French politics.

In early 2017, the centre-right former prime minister was the clear favourite to win the race to lead France, when the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchainé questioned payments made to his wife out of public funds.

After Fillon claimed she had worked as his assistant, the investigative programme Envoyé Special uncovered an interview Mrs Fillon, 64, gave to the Sunday Telegraph in 2007 in which, asked whether she worked with or for her husband, she had replied: I have never actually been his assistant or anything like that.

The accusations, which became known as Penelopegate, were especially damaging as Fillon had campaigned as the clean-hands candidate who had never been embroiled in any wrongdoing or political scandal.

Fillon, who served as prime minister under the centre-right president Nicolas Sarkozy, tried to outrun the scandal, refusing to abandon his campaign but was eliminated in the first round of the presidential election, leaving the mainstream right without a candidate in the second round for the first time in Frances postwar history.

Emmanuel Macron, a little-known former economy minister and banker, stepped into the political vacuum to face the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round run-off.

Fillon, now working for an investment bank, has kept a low profile until last month when he gave a pre-trial television interview. He insisted his wife had performed an essential working role in his constituency in Sarthe, in north-west France, for which she was reportedly paid an average of 3,000 per month and sometimes up to 5,200.

From the beginning, we worked together  proof of this will be shown during the trial, Fillon insisted.

He said the confusion had come about because the interview his wife had given in 2007 was in English and that she had been circumspect about her role.

The word assistant has another meaning in English than in French, he said, adding his wife had always been discreet and shy.

Prosecutors have thrown doubt on his claims, reporting that investigations suggest Mrs Fillon may have dealt with her husbands post and emails but was not his parliamentary assistant when she was paid a total of around 1m between 1998 and 2013.

A third suspect, Marc Jouland, 62, who took over the Sarthe constituency as a member of the Assemblée Nationale when Fillon became a cabinet minister and reportedly continued to employ Penelope Fillon as his assistant, will also stand trial on charges of embezzlement. He also denies the accusations.

Mrs Fillon, née Clarke, from Llanover near Abergavenny in Wales, is accused of complicity to misuse public funds. She is also under investigation for being paid for an allegedly fake job at a French language monthly literary, cultural and political affairs magazine, Revue des Deux Mondes.

In last months interview, Fillon, whose disgrace left the mainstream right Les Républicains party in disarray, ruled out making a political comeback. He said he was speaking to defend his familys honour. His wife, with whom he has five children, is a candidate at the nationwide municipal elections for her local council, scheduled to be held next month.

The trial opens on Monday in Paris and is expected to last until 11 March. Fillon faces up to 10 years in prison and a 1m fine if convicted of misusing public funds.",am
449,"The chief fundraiser and senior adviser to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who played a critical role in the rise to power of the charismatic politician, was involved in the movement of millions of dollars to offshore havens, the Paradise Papers reveal.

Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, who was instrumental in Trudeaus successful bid for the leadership of the Canadian Liberal party in 2013 and the premiership two years later, engaged through his family investment business in a complex web of entities in the US, Israel and the Cayman Islands. Multimillion-dollar cashflows between the three jurisdictions might legally have avoided taxes in the US, Canada and Israel.

The leaked documents unveil a close relationship between two wealthy families who collaborated to shift millions of dollars to the Cayman Islands. On one side were the Bronfman family, inheritors of the Seagram distillery fortune in Montreal.

On the other side was the Cayman Islands-based trust of Leo Kolber, a former Canadian senator and powerhouse within the Liberal party Trudeau now leads.

Accountants working for the families discussed the possibility of recasting interest owed by the Kolber trust to two US-based Bronfman funds as services rendered, on the basis that the loans were not in substance (only in form). Tax experts say that such interest-free loans would generally be barred under US tax laws.

The disclosures are likely to generate political heat for the Canadian prime minister, who swept to power in October 2015 partly on his promise to tackle economic inequality and take on tax avoidance. Last year, Trudeau came under pressure in the fallout from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, during which his family inheritance was scrutinised.

At that point Trudeau insisted his personal assets, which he put into a blind trust after he won his partys leadership, were completely transparent. But he came under renewed pressure this year following a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) investigation into a KPMG scheme to help wealthy Canadians move money to the low-tax Isle of Man.

It is absolutely unacceptable that there be people not paying their fair share of taxes, the Canadian prime minister said in March, pledging to do a better job of going out and getting tax avoiders and tax frauders.

The Paradise Papers put the spotlight once again on Trudeaus record on tax fairness, only this time the focus falls within his inner circle. Specifically, on Bronfman, one of his closest advisers.

The two men are childhood friends who in recent years have revived their bond to assist Trudeaus meteoric rise. Bronfman, 53, raised $2m for Trudeaus leadership campaign and was was rewarded by being made the Liberal partys chief fundraiser with a seat on its national executive.

Bronfman runs Claridge, the Montreal-based investment firm set up by his father, Charles Bronfman, to manage the vast wealth of the Seagram liquor empire, which came to prominence in the 1920s supplying the illicit alcohol trade during US prohibition. The distinctive Seagram Building in Manhattan, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, still stands as a monument to the familys status.

One of Claridges clients was the Cayman Islands-based trust of Kolber, Stephen Bronfmans godfather and predecessor as chief fundraiser of the Liberal party who for decades was in charge of the Bronfman familys investments. Kolber was appointed to the Canadian senate in 1983 by Pierre Trudeau, Justins father, towards the end of his stint as prime minister.

The tight triangle between Kolber, Bronfman and Trudeau was on display last December when a Liberal party fundraiser, at $1,500 a ticket, was held at Kolbers Montreal home with Bronfman as co-host and Trudeau as its prize draw.

Confidential emails contained in the Paradise Papers reveal that links between the Bronfman and Kolber businesses were so close they were almost intertwined. In 1991, a Kolber family trust was set up in the Cayman Islands and Leo Kolbers son Jonathan named as one of its beneficiaries.

The Bronfmans helped kickstart the Kolber trust with an injection of millions of dollars of funds, the leaked files show, including a $5.3m loan made by Stephen Bronfman personally in 1997. By then the trust was flush with almost $40m in assets.

From the beginning, the arrangement between the two families over the repayment of the Bronfman loans was unusual. A contract tied to a Charles Bronfman loan in 1991 of almost $10m said: The loan shall bear interest at such rate as may be determined between the parties from time to time.

In 2002, the Kolber trust took on an $8m debt to the Israeli offshoot of the Bronfman empire, Claridge Israel  an enterprise that, in a further sign of the close ties between the two families, Jonathan Kolber had helped set up and run after he relocated from Canada to Israel in 1991.

For reasons that are unclear but do not suggest anything unlawful, the Kolber trust debt was transferred from Claridge Israel to two other Bronfman entities. The entities, Charles Bronfman Trust and Charles R Bronfman Trust, were US-based and thus liable to pay US taxes on any interest accruing, which would be treated as income.

In October 2005, Jonathan Kolber fired off an 18-page fax from his business offices in Israel about the Cayman Islands trust of which he was beneficiary. He hand-wrote on the cover sheet: CONFIDENTIAL!!

One of the documents in the fax was an email that was sent to him from a financial adviser. It noted that as a result of the switch of the debt from Claridge Israel, the Kolber trust had paid the US-based Bronfman trusts about $40,000 in interest charges.

The email went on to say: As there was never supposed to be interest paid on this debt in substance (only in form), the [Kolber trust] needs to be compensated by the Bronfman trusts for these cash outlays, in some manner to be agreed upon by both parties.

A second email from the financial adviser contained in the fax gives details of the manner by which the interest issue might be resolved. It records that senior Bronfman officials told Kolber that they would make you whole somehow.

One idea floated in the email was to get Kolber to invoice Claridge a fee for services rendered, equal to the interest which Claridge has charged to the [Kolber trust] on these loans. The Kolber trust would then mark on its books the sums as receivable fees instead of describing them as they really were  reimbursement of the interest payments.

Experts consulted by news organizations investigating the Paradise Papers said both the US and Canadian tax authorities viewed no-interest loans as red flags for potential tax avoidance schemes. Grayson McCouch, a tax professor at the University of Florida, told CBC that in his view the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would probably want to interrogate the transactions.

If its done to disguise or to reverse the purported interest payments, then it could look to an observer, particularly a revenue service, like evidence of fraudulent intent, he said.

Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told the Guardian that under US tax law any loan greater than $10,000 that charged no or below-market interest rates would be assumed by the authorities to bear imputed interest that would bring it up to applicable federal levels. The lender must report it as taxable income and pay taxes on it, he said.

The head of the international tax program at the University of Michigan, Reuven Avi-Yonah, told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that tax laws generally barred transactions that failed to report interest. You cant have interest-free loans between related parties, he said.

Jonathan Kolber stressed to CBC that he had relocated his familys trust from the Cayman Islands to Israel a few years ago following a change in Israeli tax law. The trust declared Israeli status and we paid back taxes and whatever they asked for, he said.

Kolber went on to deny any wrongdoing: Ive never broken any laws and this was all reported and so transparent, and is now an Israeli entity. This has all been declared and above board and properly handled with full transparency.

Stephen Bronfman and Leo Kolber declined to comment.

A lawyer representing Jonathan Kolber and Bronfman father and son denied any improper activity on their part. He said: None of the transactions or entities at issue were effected or established to evade or even avoid taxation. My clients have always acted properly and ethically, including fully complying with all applicable laws and requirements.

The lawyer said that the Cayman Islands trust was set up because of volatility in Israel at the time. Kolber was not liable for tax in Canada under existing law given that he no longer lived there; nor was there any tax owing in his adoptive Israel.

The lawyer confirmed that Stephen Bronfman did make a $5.3m loan to the Kolber trust in 1997, but said it was repaid within five months.

Of the proposed reimbursement of interest from the two Bronfman trusts based in the US to the Kolber trust and the suggestion that it be portrayed as services rendered, the lawyer said: No invoices were sent and nothing was paid. He added that non-interest-bearing loans by a US person do not violate US law.

450,"SAN FRANCISCO (CN)  A 12-person jury found a trail of digital bread crumbs led to Yevgeniy Nikulin as the hacker responsible for three data breaches in 2012 at LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring and the theft of more than 100 million user credentials.

The trail began with Nick Berry, a LinkedIn engineer whose personal computer was hacked in March 2012. By installing a malicious software program that allowed him to gain access to Berrys Virtual Private Network the means by which Berry could log to log in to work remotely the hacker infiltrated the companys internal database of user credentials.

Using credentials stolen from LinkedIn, the hacker next targeted Dropbox employee Tom Wiegand and breached his work account, sending an invite to himself at the email address chinabig01@gmail.com to join a shared employee Dropbox account.

From there, he went on to compromise Formspring employee John Sanders work account by accessing the password database Sanders had stored in his Dropbox, then using Sanders work login to breach Formsprings corporate database and make off with millions of hashed user passwords from the now shuttered Q&A site that later showed up on internet hacker forums.

The data from one intrusion facilitated the next, Assistant United States Attorney Katherine Wawrzyniak told the jury during closing arguments Friday.

Investigators tied all three company hacks to the chinabig01@gmail.com address. Wawrzyniak told the jury that the email address was a burner account intended to receive automatic messages sent to the hackers various aliases. Chinabig01 was also used to create a Vimeo account with username Uarebeenhacked.

Prosecutors believe Nikulin controlled that email address, as well as r00talka@gmail.com, which was used account on the gaming website Kongregate with the username and password zopaqwe1, the same username and password used by chinabig01@gmail.com for an account on the domain hosting site Afraid.org.

They also linked r00talka and chinagbig01 through search history both contained searches related to Kantemirovskaya Street, the Moscow residence IP address records traced to Nikulin, as well as searches for information related to Linkedin hack. R00talka was also the recipient of numerous notifications from Nikulins social media account on VKRussias Facebook equivalentalerting him to messages from his brother and girlfriend, along with a message from a friend saying the two were neighbors again on Kantemirovskaya Street.

Nikulin, using the alleged pseudonym Yevgeniy Lomovich a surname that translates to crowbar and prosecutors believe is a play on hacker gave his friend Oleksander Ieremenko via Skype chat the login and password zopaqwe1 for his account on Afraid.org. Investigators later obtained records from Afraid.org showing someone was scanning its systems for vulnerabilities.

The Skype chat logs were obtained from a U.S. Secret Service search of Iremenkos apartment in Ukraine as part of an unrelated cybercriminal investigation, and later turned over to the FBI.

The carefully collected digital evidence proves the following: Chinabig01@gmail.com was responsible for the hacks, and is connected to these other electronic accounts including ultimately the r00talka@gmail.com address, Wawrzyniak said. R00talka is clearly controlled by the defendant Yevgeniy Nikulin. This is how the digital trail ties together.

Nikulin, now 32, was arrested in the Czech Republic in 2016 and extradited to the U.S. in 2018 to face nine criminal counts of computer intrusion, causing damage to a protected computer, aggravated identity theft, trafficking and conspiracy. The jury convicted him on all counts, but found the government did not present enough evidence to prove that he committed the Dropbox and Formspring hacks for financial gain.

Wawrzyniak painted Nikulin as part of a close clique of hacker friends. Ieremenko and Nikulin talked about his problems with his girlfriend Anna, and Nikulin, Iremenko and other hackers supposedly met at a Moscow hotel conference room in March 2012.

Nikita Kislitsin, indicted for trying to sell the stolen Formspring data, was also at that hotel meeting. Wawrzyniak said Kislitsin was acquainted with Nikulin through a mutual friend named Alexsey Belan, who urged Kislitsin through email to contact Nikulin, though he did not explicitly name Nikulin in the email exchange.

In his closing, Nikulins counsel Adam Gasner said the governments evidence was unreliable, circumstantial, and at times confusing. He said prosecutors had no direct evidence of Nikulins guilt, only weak and unclear connections. He attacked the reliability of the information prosecutors received from the Russian government connecting Nikulins IP address to the LinkedIn hack.

The source of that evidence is the Russian government itself, he said. The source of the evidence comes from an entity that actually supports criminal activity and any evidence they provide should be suspect and given little weight.

He made much of the questionable authenticity of documents returned to the FBI through a mutual legal assistance treaty with Russia, and suggested that Nikulin might have been framed by his own government.

The actual certificate of authenticity is straight up not filled out correctly, he said. Its missing essential information that should not give you any confidence in the quality of this evidence.

Gasner said FBI Special Agent Jeffrey Miller, the governments star witness in the case, had tunnel vision that prevented him from considering the possibility that at-large hacker Evgeniy Bogachev could have been responsible for the crime.

After all, Bogachev is still wanted by the FBI in connection with a devastating malware attack that compromised 100 million bank accounts around the world.

Zeroing in on Russias history of conspiring with hacker mercenaries, he added, Why would the Russian government provide misinformation to the U.S.? Perhaps allowing a real culprit to be caught and tried in the U.S. would lead to a lot of revelations the Russians dont want us to know.

Prosecutors urged the jury not to consider this.

Nothing was similar about these hacks and the allegations against Evgeniy Bogachev, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Kane said on rebuttal. The defendant is literally pointing to some other guy with the same first name and saying maybe he did it. Theres not a shred of evidence that points to that.

Kane also scoffed at the idea of a possible frame-up by the Russian government. If you think about that for more than one second it completely falls apart, she said, noting the IP address records were obtained by the FBI from Russia in 2013, while Nikulins Skype chat logs with Ieremenko were from October 2012.

It would have required the Russian government to go back to 2012 and plant evidence on a computer in Ukraine to frame the defendant.

The jury, as it turned out, didnt buy the defense teams alternate theories.

After the verdict was read, U.S. Attorney David Anderson issued a statement hailing it as a warning to would-be hackers and congratulating the Northern District for holding its first jury trial during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Todays guilty verdicts are the result of our first federal jury trial in San Francisco since the beginning of shelter in place. I am immensely grateful to Judge Alsup for getting this case to trial. Trial by jury is one of the defining features of the American justice system. We need jury trials to administer justice, said U.S. Attorney Anderson.

Nikulins conviction is a warning to would-be hackers, wherever they may be. Computer hacking is not just a crime, it is a direct threat to the security and privacy of Americans. American law enforcement will respond to that threat regardless of where it originates.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup also praised the jury.

You are a tremendous group of people and our country should be proud to have a group of citizens willing to come in during a pandemic and put yourself at risk so our criminal justice system can survive, he told them. You are the first jury to sit as a jury in this district since the pandemic. A lot of the country has been following the case in order to learn about how we can continue the criminal justice system in this time.",am

452,"PRAGUE  Tensions have escalated in Bosnia and Herzegovina after Bosnian Serb leaders threatened to pull out of state institutions, accused a senior American UN diplomat of conspiring against the Serbs and demanded the right to secede from the country.

Bosnian Serb officials, Western diplomats and the police said Tuesday that the crisis began last week when Bosnia's state police agency sent a report to the State Prosecutor's Office with allegations involving Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, a Bosnian Serb, and a case related to corruption, fraud and misuse of funds.

The case outlined in the State Investigation and Protection Agency report involves several key infrastructure deals in the Bosnian Serb Republic, including allegations concerning a $146 million government building in Banja Luka.

Gordan Milosevic, a spokesman for Dodik, said Tuesday by telephone that the allegations were politically motivated. He said the manner in which the case had been passed on to prosecutors breached due process because it had been forwarded without the approval of top Bosnian Serb officials in both the State Investigation and Protection Agency, or SIPA, and the prosecutor's office.",am

I rigged parliament votes for President Poroshenko  fugitive Ukrainian MP

He said that the case against him is a setup and the Ukrainian government tried to frame him to cover up a large-scale bribery scheme linked directly to President Poroshenko.

Onishchenko, who said he was a key figure in the complex scheme for two years, vowed to show western sponsors of the Ukrainian government where their money is actually going. He told RT that most IMF aid money is being used by President Poroshenko and his accomplices to fuel the ongoing civil conflict in the east of Ukraine.

Most of the money they use for the war. I think that Poroshenko is very interested to keep the war, Onishchenko said. An overgrown military not only allows Poroshenko to reap profits from war-time contracts but also suppress political opponents, the fugitive Ukrainian MP alleged.

All the contracts for this war, even the smaller [ones], like weapons, or some stuff for the army, they [are going through] the companies which are close to [Poroshenko]. They are just [laundering] money  for them the war is like business.

Ukraine's president and his accomplices have a stake in all the major businesses in the country now and its impossible for someone outside the inner circle to make money in Ukraine, according to Onishchenko, who claims Poroshenko and his team are scared that someone could potentially fund the opposition in the wake of upcoming elections

Poroshenko is in control now [of] all the states companies. Its the biggest business theyre doing. Its a chemical factory in Odessa, a lot of state energy companies, said Onishchenko. Only people close to the president have been put in charge of these companies, he said.

They use this money for political [advantage] for voting, for supporting  they use this money to make Poroshenko stronger, Onishchenko added.

A scandal surrounding impressive income declarations, recently filed by Ukrainian politicians, brought to attention the scale of Ukrainian corruption, Onishchenko told RT.

He hopes the recent revelations about the scale of corruption in the Ukrainian government will result in the end of financial aid to the country.

All Europe was shocked after the declaration of the people from the parliament of Ukraine. If you saw, all the peoples deputies, they declared so much cash. It was crazy, like millions and millions. How did they make that cash? Onishchenko said.

Poroshenko corrupts them  pays them money for voting. Thats why they have so much money now. Theyre buying  big houses, they are buying yachts and a lot of stuff. They must explain where the money is from. Thats why they put the money in these declarations. After these declarations from the government of Ukraine and this corruption scandal, even what I said to the press, I dont see that western Europe will support [them] anymore, I mean, financially, Ukraine. Because they see they just use money for corruption and theyll never accept this.",am
454,"Public officials and private individuals close to the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, have been linked to a money-laundering scheme involving Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, according to a recent report.

According to the report published by Washington DC-based thinktank IBI Consultants, Bukele and his inner circle received up to $2 million in loans, either in a personal capacity or through companies related to Alba Petróleos, a PDVSA subsidiary in El Salvador. Additionally, it states that this money was part of a massive money-laundering scheme carried out in Venezuela, El Salvador, the United States and Panama, among other countries.

Several PDVSA subsidiaries, including Alba Petróleos, were sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in March 2019 under the suspicion that they were involved in a variety of schemesdesigned to embezzle billions of dollars, the same reason given for US sanctions against PDVSA in 2019.

Alba Petróleos, founded in El Salvador in 2006 and financed almost entirely by PDVSA, is a consortium of various companies. On paper, the companies are dedicated to providing services in sectors as varied as aviation, finance and agricultural development. But according to reports from the Salvadoran government, the consortium managed to make $1 billion in profits within just one decade.

SEE ALSO: El Salvador News and Profiles

According to the IBI Report, which drew from official financial documents and interviews collected across the region, Alba Petróleos used shady methods to make money, making $1 billion disappear through offshore companies and fraud from 2007-2017.

The fact that Bukele and his family companies took some $2 million from Alba Petróleos when it was showing distorted and irrational economic returns calls into question the presidents willingness to engage in even minimal know your customer due diligence, it reads.

Just months after Bukele assumed the presidency of El Salvador, investigations began to surface into money he had received from Alba Petróleos. The countrys Attorney Generals Office has an open investigation into a network of at least 23 Alba Petróleos companies suspected of money laundering, including Inverval S.A. de C.V., from which Bukele received at least $1.9 million under his own name.

InSight Crime asked the Salvadoran Attorney Generals Office about the current state of these investigations. A spokesperson would only comment that the anti-money laundering law prohibits her from providing information at this time.

In addition, IBI Consultants found that Bukeles administration has ties to José Luis Merino. A former Salvadoran guerrilla commander and vice minister of foreign affairs, Merino is accused by the US Congress of long-standing associations with transnational organized criminal networks [that] are the subject of US criminal investigations.

According to the report, Merino was a crucial part of Alba Petróleos management, either directly or through the use of frontmen, since its creation. It states that he wields influence over the Bukele administration, particularly through Erick Vega, an adviser to the Salvadoran president whom IBI identified as an intermediary between Alba Petróleos and investors of questionable origin related to PDVSA, including several from Russia. InSight Crime tried to contact Vega but didnt receive a response.

Neither Bukele, nor his government, have directly responded to the accusations, which have been echoed by Salvadoran newspapers and international media. The only commentary was made by the presidents legal secretary, Conan Castro, who denied ties between the government and Merino during a televised interview in mid-September.

InSight Crime Analysis

These new allegations round off a list of suspicions surrounding Bukele, including the alleged corruption of administration officials during the pandemic, possible deals with the MS13 gang in exchange for electoral support and calls for attention regarding his flouting of freedom of expression, among others.

Until now, most of these concerns were related to El Salvadors internal political affairs, but this new report suggests that different types of structures have an influence over the Bukele government.

According to the IBI report, Alba Petróleos illicit actions, including by Merino and Vega, began with million-dollar money transfers on Salvadoran soil through unusual real estate deals. These actions are being investigated in El Salvador, the United States and Venezuela, officials from all three countries confirmed to InSight Crime. In 2006, for example, a Venezuelan woman, registered as the owner of PDV Caribe  one of the front companies associated with Alba Petróleos  bought two lots for $84.2 million, a very unusual price for the local market, according to a financial analyst that previously worked in the Salvadoran Attorney Generals Office and who spoke with InSight Crime on the condition of anonymity.

According to sources within Panamas Financial Intelligence Unit consulted by Douglas Farah, author of the IBI report, Alba Petróleos then sent huge sums to bank accounts in Panama, Switzerland, Gibraltar, Luxembourg and Russia. One of the Panamanian auditors explained that Alba Petróleos window-dressed these transactions, passing them off as debts acquired by Panamanian companies and corporations based in Miami.

Vega and Merino also allegedly participated in an effort to ensure transactions involving millions of dollars with a Russian bank. The operation was never completed, but, according to Farah, the Russians offered a way to launder money that could not be traced and that could circumvent possible sanctions from the United States or the European Union.

I think that there should be some serious concern about the level of involvement, within the highest ranks of the Bukele Administration, of individuals that are directly linked to José Luis Merino and Alba Petróleos You cannot lead a clean and transparent government when individuals linked to these groups are in prominent positions of government, Farah told InSight Crime.",am
455,"WARSAW: Polish prosecutors said on Saturday (Oct 17) they had brought fraud charges against a prominent lawyer and former deputy prime minister who is a vocal critic of the government, and prohibited him from leaving Poland or practising law.

Prosecutors also denied mistreating Roman Giertych, who fainted during his detention on Thursday and is currently defending billionaire bank owner Leszek Czarnecki, a thorn in the government's side who is suspected of cheating clients of his Idea Bank.

The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) said on Thursday that Giertych had taken part in a scheme to take money out of a company and launder funds, to the tune of more than 90 million zlotys (US$23 million).

Giertych's lawyer said the charges were misplaced and that he would challenge them.

Civic rights ombudsman Adam Bodnar said on Thursday that the circumstances of Giertych's arrest raised ""serious concerns"".

Prosecutor Jacek Motawski told a press conference on Saturday that any suggestion that Giertych's ""health condition ... resulted from unauthorised interference by the CBA officers"" was ""completely unfounded"".

Giertych was also representing Czarnecki two years ago when the billionaire alleged that the head of the state financial regulatory authority, Marek Chrzanowski, appointed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, had sought a bribe from one of Czarnecki's banks in return for protection. Chrzanowski has since been indicted on corruption charges.

In 2017, Giertych represented Donald Tusk, then European Council chairman, when Tusk testified in an investigation into former heads of military counter-intelligence (SKW) suspected of cooperating with foreign intelligence services without permission while Tusk was prime minister.In 2007, Giertych was leader of the far-right League of Polish Families while it was briefly in government with the PiS.",am
456,"BRASILIA, Brazil  Brazil's corruption crisis struck the heart of President Michel Temer's government Tuesday, April 11, with the opening of probes into no less than 9 ministers.

What Brazilian media called ""the bomb"" and even ""the atomic bomb"" landed when the Supreme Court authorized probes against 108 politicians in the already giant ""Car Wash"" investigation.

The investigation into a massive embezzlement and bribery conspiracy that fleeced state oil company Petrobras and funneled dirty money into leading political parties' election war chests has already been running 3 years.

But the new probes threaten the stability of Temer's deeply unpopular government just as he struggles to enact austerity measures in a bid to pull Brazil out of a historic recession.

Supreme Court documents showed that 9 ministers were on the list of targeted politicians, all suspected of involvement in the Car Wash scheme.

They included Temer's influential chief of staff Eliseu Padilha, newly appointed Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, and Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi.

In addition, the Supreme Court authorized probes against 3 state governors, 29 senators and 42 members of the lower house of Congress, the respected Estadao newspaper reported. Among the lawmakers were the speakers of the upper and lower houses.

The Supreme Court handles all cases involving sitting politicians and was responding to a March request by top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot to open the cases.

The accusations in Janot's list are based on a deluge of testimony given in connection with plea bargains struck with 77 former executives of the giant Odebrecht construction firm, which was at the heart of the Petrobras scheme.

The former Odebrecht employees, including ex-CEO Marcelo Odebrecht, have confessed to systemic bribery of politicians in exchange for inflated contracts with Petrobras and favorable legislation in Congress. The money went either directly into politicians' pockets or into party campaign slush funds.

Speculation had been mounting over the fallout for Temer's center-right government from the publication of the Supreme Court list.

Temer, pushing for painful economic reforms as Brazil enters its third year of recession, already faced questions over his legitimacy.

He took over last year from leftist president Dilma Rousseff after she was impeached for illegal handling of government finances. She claims she was victim of a coup.

Several of Temer's ministers have already had to resign due to involvement in the Car Wash scandal.

The Supreme Court is so far only authorizing investigations and Temer has already said he will not sack any minister who had not been formally charged with a crime.

But the probes further discredit Temer's ruling PMDB party, with its senior senator Romero Juca, among those on the list.

Also targeted is Aecio Neves, who heads the centrist PSDB party and narrowly lost Brazil's last presidential election.

The huge scandal has already claimed a host of big politicians and business figures.

Former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from the Workers' Party faces multiple Car Wash probes.

Rousseff, who succeeded her mentor Lula, is reported to be on Janot's list, but this has not been confirmed.

Since they are no longer elected officials, the two former presidents are dealt with by lower courts, not the Supreme Court.  Rappler.com",am
457,"Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, has dismissed allegations of corruption as rumours and innuendoes as she mounted a strong defence of her personal integrity. Johnson Sirleaf, in London for the UN high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda (video), acknowledged that corruption had become ""systemic and endemic"" in Liberia after decades of conflict, but challenged anyone to find fault with her or her family.

Johnson Sirleaf, who was re-elected in a landslide last November after an opposition boycott, has won praise for restoring stability to a country ravaged by war. Since coming to power, Africa's first elected female leader has stabilised the economy. Foreign debt has been virtually wiped out and Liberia has enjoyed annual growth rates of 6.5% for the past six years. Johnson Sirleaf hopes Liberia will be free from aid dependence in 10 years' time and achieve middle-income status by 2030.

Notwithstanding her achievements, Johnson Sirleaf has recently come under fire for nepotism, having appointed three of her sons to top government posts, although one of them, Charles, has been suspended as deputy governor of the central bank for failing to declare his assets.

This month, Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian activist and joint winner with Johnson Sirleaf of last year's Nobel peace prize, resigned from the country's peace and reconciliation commission, criticising the president's decision to appoint her three sons to senior positions. Gbowee also criticised Johnson Sirleaf for not doing enough to address poverty.

While acknowledging that corruption is a problem in Liberia, Johnson Sirleaf said defiantly: ""I challenge anyone who says it's with me or my family. We have a very vibrant society, a society that's full of rumours and innuendoes  Now I have to put [people] in certain places where I get the best results based upon talent, based upon competence and based upon integrity, and that's what I do. I stand the test and I challenge anyone who says there are other motives. I stand by my record and stand by the record of my family very firmly.""

On Gbowee's resignation, Johnson Sirleaf, who spoke as a guest of the Royal African Society, said her fellow Nobel laureate was too young to know what Liberia had been through to achieve peace. ""We respect her decision,"" said Johnson Sirleaf. ""We suspect she will change her mind  we'll need all our talent.""

On another contentious issue, the president said the government was aware of complaints that foreign companies had taken advantage of local communities in pursuit of land deals. Liberia is seeking to attract foreign investors that can develop its rich natural resources  gold, iron ore and agricultural land. According to Liberian campaigners, Johnson Sirleaf's government granted more than a third of Liberia's land to private investors for logging, mining and agro-industrial enterprises between 2006 and 2011. More than 2.8m hectares (7m acres) have become forestry and agricultural concessions. Land deals with the Malaysian corporation Sime Darby for the production of palm oil have been particularly divisive, with about 150,000 people directly affected in the first five years of plantation development.

The president said her government is reviewing land concessions and, where there had been unfair agreements, land would be returned to the community. But activists say this is mere window dressing and that the problem of unfair land deals is a direct result of the absence of a clear land tenure policy. ""The government recognised the problems, placed a moratorium on the sale of public land and established the land commission to come up with policies regarding land,"" said Robert Nyahn, programme manager of Save My Future Foundation, a Liberian NGO that monitors foreign companies in the extractive sector.

""While the policy is not yet developed by the land commission, the government contradicts itself by granting large concessions for forestry, mining and agriculture on what it claims to be public land  the same public land  while people's right to land, especially customary ownership, is still in question. These concessions are granted by government without consultation with communities who live on the land granted as concession. When communities start to raise the issues, the government pretends it will review the concession agreements,"" Nyahn added.

Johnson Sirleaf was speaking at a business breakfast in London. The Liberian leader is one of three co-chairs of the high-level panel deciding what should come after the millennium development goals (MDGs) along with David Cameron, the UK prime minister, and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian president. Johnson Sirleaf said three years remained to meet the eight MDGs and she wanted to see a big push to meet those off-track. ""The post-2015 agenda has to build on the MDGs, but peace has to be fundamental,"" she said. ""Without it, it is hard to achieve other goals.""",am
458,"Sudan was designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1993. In 2013, the Government of Sudan remained a generally cooperative counterterrorism partner and continued to take action to address threats to U.S. interests and personnel in Sudan.

Elements of al-Qa'ida (AQ)-inspired terrorist groups remained in Sudan. The Government of Sudan has taken steps to limit the activities of these elements, and has worked to disrupt foreign fighters' use of Sudan as a logistics base and transit point for terrorists going to Mali, Syria, and Afghanistan. However, groups continued to operate in Sudan in 2013 and there continued to be reports of Sudanese nationals participating in terrorist organizations. For example, regional media outlets alleged one Sudanese national was part of an al-Shabaab terrorist cell that attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in September. There was also evidence that Sudanese violent extremists participated in terrorist activities in Somalia and Mali.

In 2013, Sudan continued to allow members of Hamas to travel, fundraise, and live in Sudan.

The UN and NGOs reported in 2013 that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is likely operating in the disputed Kafia Kingi area, claimed by Sudan and South Sudan, in close proximity to Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). At year's end, the United States continued to engage the Government of Sudan, the AU, and the UN to evaluate these reports.

The kidnapping of foreigners for ransom in Darfur continued, although no U.S. citizens were kidnapped in 2013. These kidnappings have hindered humanitarian operations in Darfur. Abductees have been released unharmed amid rumors of ransoms having been paid.

In 2013, the United States continued to pursue justice for the January 1, 2008 killing of two U.S. Embassy employees. At the end of the year, the Sudanese Supreme Court was deliberating on an appeal filed by defense attorneys of the three remaining men convicted of the two murders, requesting that their death sentences be commuted. In February 2013, one of five men convicted of aiding the 2010 escape attempt by the four convicted killers received a presidential commutation of his remaining sentence. Government of Sudan authorities explained his release was part of a broad administrative parole affecting 200 other prisoners who had served some portion of their sentences with good behavior. U.S. officials protested the commutation and urged the Government of Sudan authorities to imprison the convicted accomplice for the full 12 years of his sentence.

In 2013, the U.S. Department of State designated three of the individuals who participated in the January 1, 2008 killings  Abdelbasit Alhaj Alhasan Haj Hamad, Mohamed Makawi Ibrahim Mohamed, and Abd Al-Ra'Ouf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza  as Specially Designated Global Terrorists under Executive Order 13224.

In 2013, Sudanese authorities continued to prosecute 25 individuals detained during a raid in December 2012 on what the Government of Sudan described as a terrorist training camp operating in Dinder National Park. The so-called ""Dinder cell"" as of December was still awaiting trial on charges of terrorism and murder stemming from the deaths of several police involved in the December 2012 raid. At least one fringe party, Just Peace Forum, has called upon President Bashir to pardon members of the ""Dinder Cell,"" but the court cases were still ongoing at the end of the year. One trial judge from the country's terrorism court remanded several cases back to the attorney general for additional interrogations.

The Government of Sudan has made some progress in opposing terrorist financing, although members of Hamas are permitted to conduct fundraising in Sudan. The Central Bank of Sudan and its financial intelligence unit circulate to financial institutions a list of individuals and entities that have been included on the consolidated list of the UNSC 1267/1989 (al-Qa'ida) Sanctions Committee, as well as the U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations and E.O. lists. The financing of terrorism per UNSCR 1373 (2001) was criminalized in Sudan pursuant to Sudan's Money Laundering Act of 2003.

Sudan is generally responsive to international community concerns about counterterrorism efforts. Sudan's vast, mostly unmonitored borders with Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea hampered counterterrorism efforts. Nonetheless, in recent years Sudan has forged increasingly stronger relations with its neighbors. For example, in December 2013, Government of Sudan law enforcement authorities hosted a regional workshop on counterterrorism initiatives under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development's program for security sector reform.",am
459,"WASHINGTON: Gilead Sciences Inc has agreed to pay US$97 million to resolve US government claims it used a purportedly independent charity to pay illegal kickbacks to cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket costs for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Letairis.

The US Department of Justice said on Wednesday the settlement resolves allegations that Gilead improperly used the Caring Voice Coalition as a conduit to cover thousands of patients' co-payment obligations.

Gilead's actions enabled the Foster City, California-based drugmaker to boost revenue, ran from June 2007 to December 2010, and violated the federal False Claims Act, the department said.

That law prohibits drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs.

""Gilead used data from CVC that it knew it should not have, and effectively set up a proprietary fund within CVC to cover the co-pays of just its own drug,"" US Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said in a statement.

He said such conduct undermines Medicare's co-pay structure, which Congress meant to prevent against inflated drug prices.

Drugmakers cannot subsidise co-payments for older Americans enrolled in Medicare, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance.

Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The settlement resulted from an industrywide probe led by Lelling's office into drugmakers' support for so-called patient assistance charities.

Eleven drug companies including Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc and United Therapeutics Corp have reached more than US$1 billion of settlements with the government. Four foundations and a pharmacy have also settled.",am
460,"The case is the result of a continuing industry-wide investigation by SEC into abuses involving pre-released ADRs

The US-based broker-dealer arm of Netherlands banking giant ABN AMRO on Thursday agreed to pay $586,000 to settle claims that they issued American Depository Receipts (ADRs) without possessing the underlying foreign shares.

The agency accuses ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC of failure to supervise its securities lending desks which caused ADRs to be issued while not backed by actual shares, leaving them ripe for potential market abuse.

ABN AMRO Clearing is a provider of clearing and financing services, handling over 16 million trades per day and covering the worlds leading exchanges across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific

The SEC has probed, fined several Wall Street banks including Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan as it examines whether they have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud.

Specifically, the top securities watchdog said ABN AMRO provided ADRs, which are certificates representing ownership of a foreign stock, to clients without ensuring they would be backed by the actual shares. The pre-released ADRs were used for abusive practices, including inappropriate short selling and inappropriate profiting around dividend payouts.

A continuing industry-wide SEC investigation

The SEC.s New York regional office had previously fined Deutsche Bank $75 million to settle claims that they issued American Depository Receipts (ADRs) without possessing the underlying foreign shares.

The Wall Streets top regulator said ABN AMRO did not admit or deny the SECs findings but agreed to return its ill-gotten gains and comply with the SECs fine. The watchdog added in a statement that its investigations revealed that misconduct by numerous industry participants had the effect of introducing phantom ADRs into the marketplace. At times of high demand for ADRs, or when supply from traditional lending sources was limited, a number of brokers sought pre-released ADRs from intermediary brokers, who obtained them from depositary banks.

The SECs probe was related to the prerelease of ADRs, where banks issue depositary receipts without first having the underlying shares in their custody. The practice, while intended to smooth trading, could be abused for betting against a companys stock by selling shares they dont own, without borrowing or locating the shares needed to cover the sale. The regulator also says such receipts are being used to illegally arbitrage between different tax regimes.

Brokers who sell or transfer ADRs are typically responsible for ensuring that a matching number of foreign shares has been deposited with a custodian.",am
461,"NEW YORK - Citigroup (C) will pay nearly $100 million to federal authorities to settle claims that a lack of internal controls and negligence in the bank's Mexican subsidiary may have allowed customers to commit money laundering.

The Justice Department announced Monday that Citi's Banamex division will pay $97.4 million for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.

Federal authorities alleged that, from 2007 to 2012, Banamex officials allowed more than 30 million remittances from the U.S. to Mexico worth roughly $8.8 billion. While Banamex's internal controls alerted the bank to 18,000 potentially suspicious transactions, Banamex investigated fewer than 10 of them.

Citi did not admit any fault in the settlement. Banamex USA admitted to criminal violations by ""willfully failing"" to maintain an effective anti-money laundering compliance program, according to the Justice Department.

Banamex USA is an affiliate of Banamex, which Citigroup bought in 2001.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and California regulators in 2015 ordered Banamex USA to pay a $140 million civil money penalty to resolve separate regulatory investigations.

Citi, which previously announced it was winding down Banamex's U.S. operations, entered what's known as a ""non-prosecution agreement"" with authorities.

The Justice Department cited Banamex USA's remedial actions and cooperation with federal authorities as reasons the agency decided not to prosecute the unit. For one year, Citi must report to Justice any evidence or allegations of violations of money laundering rules.",am
462,"Standard Chartered has been ordered to pay $1.1bn (£842m) by US and UK authorities to settle allegations of poor money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries including Iran.

The British bank has agreed to pay $947m to American agencies, including the US Department of Justice, over allegations that it violated sanctions against a string of countries including Iran.

Separately, it was fined £102m by the Financial Conduct Authority for anti-money-laundering breaches that included shortcomings in its counter-terrorism finance controls in the Middle East. It is the second-largest fine ever imposed by the UK regulator for anti-money-laundering failures.

The US treasury department said the latest fines settled apparent violations of sanctions imposed against Burma, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, and Iran.

It said Standard Chartered processed transactions worth $438m between 2009 and 2014, the majority of which involved Iran-linked accounts from its Dubai branch routing payments through, or to, its New York office or other US-based banks.

The fines were widely expected after Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900m (£691m) to cover US and UK penalties. However, the final settlements will force the bank to take a further $190m hit in its first-quarter results, which it will report on 30 April.

Standard Chartered said on Tuesday it accepts full responsibility for the violations and control deficiencies, adding that the vast majority of the alleged incidents took place before 2012. None of the breaches occurred after 2014, it added.

But the bank, which is headquartered in London but focused on Asia, the Middle East and Africa, placed partial blame on two former junior employees, who were aware of certain customers Iranian connections and conspired with them to break the law, deceive the group and violate its policies. Standard Chartered said: Such behaviour is wholly unacceptable to the group.

Bill Winters, the chief executive, said: We are pleased to have resolved these matters and to put these historical issues behind us. The circumstances that led to todays resolutions are completely unacceptable and not representative of the Standard Chartered I am proud to lead today.

The settlements announced on Tuesday are, together, the largest imposed on Standard Chartered since 2012, when it paid $667m to put to rest US allegations of sanctions breaches between 2001 and 2007.

US assistant attorney general, Brian Benczkowski, said: Todays resolution sends a clear message to financial institutions and their employees: if you circumvent US sanctions against rogue states like Iran  or assist those who do  you will pay a steep price.

The Financial Conduct Authority had raised concerns about anti-money-laundering controls at Standard Chartereds UK-based correspondent bank and its United Arab Emirates branches. It highlighted serious shortcomings in customer due diligence and said the bank also failed to ensure its UAE branches applied proper counter-terrorist financing controls.

The FCA gave examples where a customer was able to open an account by handing over around 3m UAE dirham (£500,000) in cash in a suitcase, with little evidence that the source of the cash was investigated. It also said Standard Chartered failed to collect sufficient information on a customer exporting goods that could have a military application to regions involved in armed conflict.

The prospect of major fines have hung over Standard Chartered since 2012, when it entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the US Department of Justice and the New York county district attorneys office over Iranian sanctions breaches beyond 2007.

Other UK banks to have fallen foul of US authorities include RBS, which paid out more than $10bn in relation to the alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. In 2012, HSBC paid a fine of $1.9bn to settle US money-laundering allegations.

DPAs allow firms to settle charges with state authorities without facing criminal prosecution. The companies must agree to specified conditions, which can include a fine and their conduct being monitored for a set period.

The DPA was set to expire on Wednesday, but has now been extended until April 2021. Over the next two years Standard Chartered will effectively be on probation, giving US agencies the right to criminally prosecute the bank if it breaks the law.

Standard Chartered said it had undergone a comprehensive and positive transformation since the conduct and control issues ... occurred. The shares ended the day up 0.3% at 647p.",am
463,"LIMASSOL, Cyprus  A bank in Cyprus investigated accounts associated with President Donald Trumps former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, for possible money-laundering, two banking sources with direct knowledge of his businesses here told NBC News.

Manafort  whose ties to a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin are under scrutiny  was associated with at least 15 bank accounts and 10 companies on Cyprus, dating back to 2007, the sources said. At least one of those companies was used to receive millions of dollars from a billionaire Putin ally, according to court documents.

Banking sources said some transactions on Manafort-associated accounts raised sufficient concern to trigger an internal investigation at a Cypriot bank into potential money laundering activities. After questions were raised, Manafort closed the accounts, the banking sources said.

Exclusive: Manafort-Linked Accounts on Cyprus Raised Red Flag

March 28, 201702:43

Offshore banking in Cyprus is not illegal, and the island has long been known as a hub for moving money in and out of Russia. Several U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about Manaforts business dealings in Cyprus.

A spokesman for Manafort told NBC News in a statement that all the accounts were set up at the direction of clients in Cyprus, a common banking center for Russians and Ukrainians, ""for a legitimate business purpose.""

""All were legitimate entities and established for lawful ends,"" the statement said.

It added that Manafort ""has no specific personal recollection"" about the account closures, but understands that they were shut down just before a 2012 government takeover of the bank in the midst of a banking crisis.

Court documents and company registries reviewed by NBC News and interviews with banking sources indicate that Manaforts dealings in Cyprus began in 2007, when some of the accounts were opened and some companies were established.

One of the companies linked to Manafort, PEM Advisors Limited, was involved in a multimillion-dollar deal with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, according to court documents filed in the Cayman Islands.

Deripaska  described in U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 as ""one of 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis""  once was denied entry to the United States because of alleged organized crime ties, current and former officials have told NBC News.

He paid PEM $18.9 million to buy a television and media network in Ukraine, according to the Cayman Island court documents. But the deal fell through and the money was never accounted for, the documents say.

NBC News traced PEM and a number of other Manafort-linked companies to a law office in Nicosia, the largest city in Cyprus. Managing partner Kypros Chrysostomides, who is also Cyprus former minister of justice, declined to answer questions without what he called his clients express consent.""

Banking sources said that in October 2009, one of the 15 Manafort-associated bank accounts in Cyprus received a payment of a million dollars and left the account on the same day. Experts said the way the multiple accounts and companies were used suggests they were set up to deliberately make it difficult for auditors to track the movement of funds.

""There are some red flags here,"" said Tom Cardamome, managing director of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based non-profit.

""It looks suspicious and any bank that wanted to address money laundering would certainly have looked into the ownership of the company who owned these accounts.""

The bulk of the accounts associated with Manafort were held at the Cyprus Popular Bank. In 2012, under an anti-money-laundering procedure called Know Your Customer, the bank asked for more information on the accounts' activities, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the request. Those sources said that Manafort chose to close the accounts instead.

Navigating Manafort's Web of Ties to Russia and Ukraine

March 28, 201708:35

Most of the assets of the Cyprus Popular Bank were taken over by the Bank of Cyprus in 2013. In a statement, Bank of Cyprus appeared to distance itself from Manafort.

""Bank of Cyprus has never had an extensive relationship with Mr. Manafort or any entities connected to him,"" the statement said.

It said that while most of Cyprus Popular Bank's assets were assumed by Bank of Cyprus in 2013, ""these did not include any accounts or activities relating to Mr. Manafort either directly or indirectly.""

Cyprus' attorney general, Costas Clerides, told NBC News that the Unit for Combating Money Laundering in Cyprus has handed information about Manaforts financial activities to U.S. Treasury investigators.

Several U.S. senators have raised questions about Manaforts financial relationship with Deripaska and his business links to Cyprus.

Last week, the Associated Press reported Manafort was on a $10 million-a-year consulting contract with Deripaska and promised him in a 2005 memo to influence politics and news coverage ""to greatly benefit the Putin government.""

""Mr. Manafort cannot confirm the authenticity of the memo cited by AP,"" the statement from Manafort's representatives said. ""His representatives believe that Mr. Manafort complied with any applicable reporting laws and note that his relationship with Mr. Deripaska was described contemporaneously in press accounts.""

In a paid advertisement in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Deripaska disputed the AP report and threatened legal action.

""I want to resolutely deny this malicious assertion and lie,"" the ad said. ""I have never made any commitments or contracts with the obligation or purpose to covertly promote or advance 'Putin's Government' interests anywhere in the world.""

Manafort has repeatedly denied he ever worked for the Russian government.

He has agreed to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, which is running an inquiry into whether there were ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials and Russia's effort to influence the 2016 election.",am

Seven people were charged with laundering $2.1 million  including more than $300,000 in illegally obtained coronavirus relief money - through a North Carolina casino, officials announced.

Four Georgia residents and three South Carolinians were found with more than $2.1 million in illegal cash. They are accused of laundering at least $750,000, including over $350,000 through Harrah's Cherokee Hotel and Casino, the Department of Justice announced in an indictment unsealed in South Carolina on Thursday.

Investigators found the money included the proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan of more than $359,000, the indictment states.

The case started as a drug trafficking investigation, but federal agents began digging further.

Christopher J. Agard, one of the seven, used his business, Wild Stylz Entertainment LLC, to launder money from previous criminal activity unrelated to the PPP loans, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office in the District of South Carolina.

In October 2019, he and the six others are accused of depositing and then withdrawing illegally obtained money. Three of the suspects then converted $200,000 out of $378,000 in illegal cash to casino chips at Harrahs Cherokee Casino and Resort, the indictment states.

After gambling for less than two hours, [they] cashed out from the casino and left with approximately $198,750 in cash, court papers state.

When the two suspects returned to Harrahs three days later and each tried to cash $50,000 checks, casino officials grew suspicious, according to the indictment.

A Harrahs spokesperson told Fox News the casino operates under a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program.

The program takes ""measures to prevent its casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity, spokesperson Brian Saunooke said in an email.

Months later, in May 2020, Agard applied for and received a PPP loan using bogus supporting documents connected to Wild Stylz, authorities said. He was awarded more than $395,000, but then disseminated the fraudulently obtained funds to other members of the conspiracy through various means.

Federal agents have seized more than $2.1 million in illegally-obtained funds from 12 different banks, the DOJ said. Each of the seven people was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.",am

According to the Public Prosecution Service (OM), the Hilversum couple laundered over 16 million euros in 2.5 years.

They bought millions of euros worth of bitcoins from private individuals and companies, allowing their customers to remain anonymous. These trades werent reported to the Tax Authority and there was no proper administration. Customers were often met in public spaces, usually at fast food restaurants in a big city.

The suspects, a man and his wife, came into contact with customers through advertisements on the internet and a marketplace on the dark web, the OM said. Much of the bitcoins traded bore traces of the dark web.

467,"Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Peter C. Fitzhugh, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), announced the unsealing of an indictment charging PABLO RENATO RODRIGUEZ, GUTEMBERG DOS SANTOS, SCOTT HUGHES, CECILIA MILLAN, and JACKIE AGUILAR for their roles in an internationally coordinated fraud and money laundering ring involved in defrauding individuals through investments in AirBit Club, a purported cryptocurrency mining and trading company.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels. RODRIGUEZ and HUGHES are expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge John Early of the Central District of California, MILLAN is expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld of the Middle District of North Carolina, and AGUILAR is expected to be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christine A. Nowak of the Eastern District of Texas. DOS SANTOS was arrested in Panama City, Panama, and is pending extradition to the United States.

Acting United States Attorney Audrey Strauss said: As alleged, the defendants put a modern-day spin on an age-old investment scam, promising extraordinary rates of guaranteed return on phantom investments in cryptocurrencies. Thanks to HSI, the defendants are in custody and facing serious criminal charges.

HSI Special Agent-in-Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh said: Those arrested today have not only been charged with running a multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency investment fraud and money laundering ring, but also for allegedly spending their victims money on luxury cars, jewelry, and homes. These alleged fraudsters pulled out all the stops to sell their scheme to their victims with enticing recruitment events, then shamelessly used proceeds of their scheme to recruit additional victims through even more aggressive and lavish marketing pitches. As todays arrests show, HSI New Yorks El Dorado Task Force investigates financial crimes of every type, and will stop those who prey on unsuspecting investors who entrust their hard-earned savings to so-called financial advisors. Those who violate this trust for their personal gain will face consequences for their actions.

According to the allegations in the Superseding Indictment unsealed today: [1]

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, MILLAN, and AGUILAR participated in a coordinated scheme in which victim-investors (the Victims) were induced to invest in AirBit Club based on the promise of guaranteed profits in exchange for cash investments in club memberships (the AirBit Club Scheme or the Scheme). Beginning in late 2015, AirBit Club, through its founders, RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS, as well as its promoters (the Promoters), including MILLAN and AGUILAR, marketed AirBit Club as a multilevel marketing club in the cryptocurrency industry. Promoters falsely promised Victims that AirBit Club earned returns on cryptocurrency mining and trading and that Victims would earn passive, guaranteed daily returns on any membership purchased.

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, MILLAN, and AGUILAR traveled throughout the United States, and around the world to places in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, where they hosted lavish expos and small community presentations aimed at convincing Victims to purchase AirBit Club memberships. In furtherance of the AirBit Club Scheme, the Victims were induced to buy memberships in cash, including in the Southern District of New York. Following a Victims investment, a Promoter provided the Victim with access to an online AirBit Club portal to view the purported returns on memberships (the Online Portal). While Victims saw profits accumulate on their Online Portal, those representations were false: no Bitcoin mining or trading on behalf of Victims in fact took place. Instead, RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, MILLAN, and AGUILAR enriched themselves, and spent Victim money on cars, jewelry, and luxury homes, and financed more extravagant expos to recruit more Victims.

HUGHES, an attorney licensed to practice law in California, had previously represented RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation related to another investment scheme known as Vizinova before aiding RODRIGUEZ and DOS SANTOS in perpetrating the AirBit Club Scheme by, among other things, helping to remove negative information about AirBit Club and Vizinova from the internet.

In many instances, as early as 2016, Victims who attempted to withdraw money from the AirBit Club Online Portal and complained to a Promoter were met with excuses, delays, and hidden fees amounting to more than 50% of the Victims requested withdrawal, if they were able to make any withdrawal at all. In one instance, AGUILAR told one Victim of the AirBit Club Scheme who was complaining about her inability to withdraw AirBit Club returns that she should bring new blood into the AirBit Club Scheme in order to receive her returns.

In April 2020, another victim received a notice on the AirBit Club Online Portal that his account was closed  and principal investment lost  due to execution of financial sustainability Reserve, policy #34 of the Airbit Club Terms and Conditions, due to the economic and financial crisis caused by (Covid-19).

RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, and MILLAN sought to conceal the AirBit Club Scheme, as well as their respective control of the proceeds of that Scheme, by requesting that Victims purchase memberships in cash, using third-party cryptocurrency brokers, and by laundering the Schemes proceeds through several domestic and foreign bank accounts, including an attorney trust account managed by HUGHES (the Hughes Trust Account). The Hughes Trust Account was ostensibly intended to maintain custody of HUGHESs law practices client funds. Instead, the Hughes Trust Account was used by RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, HUGHES, and MILLAN to conceal the nature and origin of the AirBit Club Schemes illicit proceeds. Through that account, HUGHES directed Victim funds to the personal expenses of RODRIGUEZ, DOS SANTOS, MILLAN, and himself, and funded promotional events and sponsorships designed to further promote the AirBit Club Scheme. In total, the defendants laundered at least $20 million in proceeds of the Scheme through these various methods.

RODRIGUEZ, 37, of Irvine, California, DOS SANTOS, 45, of Panama City, Panama, and MILLAN, 37, of Greensboro, North Carolina, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

468,"SINGAPORE: A woman who held jobs at a supermarket and a halfway house took down credit card information of customers at NTUC FairPrice, created an EZ-Link mobile account with details from a halfway house resident and combined the two to make S$41,330 worth of unauthorised EZ-Link top-ups.

For a list of computer crimes, Kas Qiu Caiying was sentenced on Tuesday (Jul 21) to eight months' jail.

The 30-year-old woman, who was a former prison officer, pleaded guilty to 11 charges under the Computer Misuse Act, with another 24 charges taken into consideration.

The court heard that Qiu worked as a cashier at NTUC FairPrice at Block 570B Woodlands Avenue 1 from January 2018 to August 2018.

In July 2018, she began taking down credit and debit card details of customers who handed her cards for payment.

She wrote down card details such as expiry dates and CVV numbers on an NTUC plastic bag, transferring them to a notebook after work.

While still working as a cashier, Qiu took up another job from April 2018 as an operations executive at Selarang Halfway House, which provides support for ex-convicts.

In August 2018, she retrieved the NRIC number and name of a resident at the halfway house using a computer terminal, and used these details to create an EZ-Link mobile application user account under the halfway house's name.

In the next four months until December 2018, Qiu used the details from 34 credit and debit cards she had copied from her cashiering job to make 1,011 EZ-Link top-up transactions worth S$41,220.

She keyed in the credit and debit card details into the EZ-Link account and made various top-up transactions with amounts ranging from S$10 to S$100 to various EZ-Link cards she had.

In total, she made 1,011 such top-up transactions to more than 500 EZ-Link cards without the authorisation of any of the credit card holders.

She then took the topped-up EZ-Link cards to various MRT stations to get cash refunds. Once she got the cash, she disposed of the EZ-Link cards and deposited the money into her bank account.

OCBC Bank caught wind of the crime after receiving multiple reports from the cardholders on unauthorised transactions made to EZ-Link applications, and filed a police report.

Qiu was arrested and made partial restitution of about S$9,100, and consented for the remaining balance of about S$30,500 in her bank account to be used for restitution.

SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF PLANNING: PROSECUTOR

Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Mathias Tan asked for eight months' jail, noting the ""significant level of premeditation and planning"" in the case.

Qiu ""meticulously noted down the credit card details of unsuspecting NTUC customers onto a plastic bag"", disposed of the plastic bag when she had transferred the information to a notebook, and obtained the details of the halfway house resident to create the EZ-Link user account.

Lawyers Josephus Tan and Cory Wong of Invictus Law asked instead for not more than five to six months' jail, saying that a large part of the money has been recovered.

Qiu worked as a prison officer for four years, struggling in the job and taking up several others before going to the halfway house as an operations executive.

She envied the ""financial freedom"" of her colleagues, many of whom were retired prison officers hired for their experience in rehabilitation.

She ""felt that it was 'unfair' that she was getting by only with her salary although she did her best"", said Mr Tan.

Qiu told a psychiatrist that she expressed ""regret over her behaviour"" when arrested, and said it was out of character and that she had acted ""stupidly"".

""She also felt depressed when she thought of the consequences to these alleged offences given that she was previously working as a prisons officer,"" said the psychiatric report tendered by the defence.

For each count of unauthorised access to computer material, Qiu could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000, or both.

In response to CNA's queries, EZ-Link said it has implemented ""robust measures to deter fraudulent activity"" of its cards, adding that the company has conducted an internal review and found no breach in the EZ-Link system.

""Nonetheless, we have implemented additional security measures to minimise the risk of misuse with stolen card details.

""We also urge the public to remain vigilant against credit card theft, and will continue to do our utmost to identify and report such incidents to the police,"" the company said.

NTUC FairPrice said in response to CNA's queries that this was ""an isolated incident"".

""The person in question has not been in our employment since 2018,"" said a FairPrice spokesperson. ""FairPrice does not condone any acts of dishonesty and staff are expected to uphold high standards of professionalism and integrity.""

""NTUC FairPrice adheres to strict PDPA guidelines and assures customers that a stringent set of processes and measures is in place to ensure that all customers data are secured and protected,"" added the spokesperson.",am
469,"SINGAPORE: A former deputy group director with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) was charged on Friday (Jul 24) with taking about S$1.24 million in bribes in the form of loans to advance contractors or subcontractors business interests with LTA.

Henry Foo Yung Thye, 46, was charged with 36 offences, including obtaining or attempting to obtain bribes in the form of loans from contractors or subcontractors and cheating his colleagues.

Twenty-two of the charges were for taking bribes in the form of loans from the contractors or subcontractors between 2014 and 2019, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said in a press release on Friday.

He is also accused of cheating his LTA colleagues into giving him about S$726,500 in loans between 2008 and 2019.

He had dishonestly concealed from them that the loans were intended to service his gambling habit and debts, charge sheets state.

This makes the total sum of the money involved across all of Foo's charges almost S$2 million, Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting told the court.

Charge sheets said that Foo took sums of between S$1,000 and S$200,000 from various directors of firms to advance their business interests with LTA.

The biggest single sum of S$200,000 was allegedly sought from Tiong Seng Contractors director Pay Teow Heng in June 2017, so that Foo would advance the contractor's business interests with LTA.

The prosecutor had asked for bail of S$500,000 for Foo, who was unrepresented. Foo told the court that he intends to plead guilty to his corruption charges and asked for the bail to be ""a manageable amount"", adding that he wants to have some time with his children.

The prosecutor told the court that none of the money lost in the corruption charges has been recovered so far.

Foo was offered bail of S$250,000 and will return to court for a pre-trial conference next month.

DIRECTORS, MANAGERS AND COMPANY CHARGED

Six individuals and a company were also charged in relation to Foos alleged offences.

Pay, the director of Tiong Seng Contractors, was among the six charged on Friday. The company's managing director, Pek Lian Guan, was also charged.

Pay, 52 and Pek, 55, allegedly conspired to give bribes in the form of loans of about S$350,000 to Foo, to advance the business interests of the company with the LTA.

They each face two charges of corruption.

Two South Koreans who worked for Daewoo Engineering and Construction were also charged with giving bribes to Foo.

Project manager Ro Sung-young, 48, and project director Kim Young-gyu, 51, were accused of conspiring to give about S$50,000 in bribes to Foo in the form of loans. They each face two charges of corruption.

Chinese national Cai Jungang, who was a director of Tritech Engineering and Testing (Singapore), was also charged with giving about S$285,000 in loans to Foo to bribe him to advance the companys business interest with LTA. The 56-year-old is facing seven charges of corruption.

Zhang Xihu, who was a director of MEPT Engineering at the time of the alleged offences, is accused of giving about S$325,000 in bribes to Foo in the form of loans. The 52-year-old faces seven charges of corruption.

The China Railway Tunnel Group (Singapore Branch) is accused of corruptly giving bribes, in the form of loans totalling about S$220,000, to Foo. The company faces three charges of corruption.

One of the charges is for giving a bribe in the form of a S$100,000 loan to Foo, then a deputy group director of the Thomson-East Coast and Cross Island Lines under LTA, in order to advance China Railway Tunnel Group's interests with LTA.

A representative for the company, Mr Fan Peng, asked for an adjournment to seek legal advice.

In relation to the offences involving the payments from the China Railway Tunnel Group, a 53-year-old man was charged with forgery.

Chen Xuguang, who worked as a director at Tong Sheng Construction and Trading, is accused of abetting the falsification of Tong Sheng invoices and faces two charges of forgery. Tong Sheng is a subcontractor of the China Railway Tunnel Group.

Most of the accused were represented by lawyers from firms including WongPartnership and Rajah & Tann.

Anyone convicted of corruption can be fined up to S$100,000, jailed for up to five years or both.

The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to seven years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or a public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such a contract.

Anyone convicted of cheating or falsification of accounts can be fined and imprisoned for up to 10 years.

Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and fraud. Bribery, cheating and the falsification of accounts are serious offences, CPIB said.

In response to CNA's queries, an LTA spokesperson confirmed Foo was charged in court on Friday for corruption and fraud.

Lawrence Hoskins, 69, was sentenced on charges of conspiracy and money laundering, following his conviction in November 2019, after a one-week jury trial before U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, who imposed todays sentence. In addition to his prison term, Hoskins was fined $30,000.

According to the evidence presented at trial, Hoskins was a senior vice president for Alstoms International Network, who engaged in a conspiracy to promote the payment of bribes to officials in Indonesia in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for Alstom Power Inc. of Connecticut and its consortium partner, Marubeni Corporation, to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. The officials in Indonesia included a high-ranking member of the Indonesian Parliament and the President of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity company in Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, Hoskins and his co-conspirators retained two consultants purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of Alstom Power Inc., in connection with the Tarahan project. The primary purpose of hiring the consultants was to conceal the bribes to Indonesian officials, the evidence showed.

The first consultant retained by Hoskins and other members of the conspiracy received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank account to be used to bribe the member of Parliament, the evidence showed. The consultant then transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of the official. According to emails admitted at trial, Hoskins and other co-conspirators discussed in detail the use of the first consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project, including referring to him as a cashier.

The trial evidence further showed that, in the fall of 2003, Hoskins and his co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was not effectively bribing key officials at PLN, who expressed concerns that the first consultant was just going to give them pocket money and disappear after Alstom Power Inc. won the project. As a result, the co-conspirators retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN officials. Evidence revealed that Hoskins and his co-conspirators pressed Alstom Power Inc. to front-load the second consultants terms of payment in order to get the right influence due to upcoming elections. Hoskins and his co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials.

The FBIs Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General and the United Kingdom, as well as authorities in France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

471,"The Portugal and Juventus footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an 18.8m (£16.5m) fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.

Ronaldo, 33, had been accused of defrauding the authorities of 14.8m (£12.9m) in unpaid taxes between 2011 and 2014.

In 2017, Madrids regional state prosecutor alleged the player had used what it deemed to be a shell company in the Virgin Islands to create a screen in order to hide his total income from Spains tax office.

It said Ronaldo intentionally did not declare income of 28.4m (£25m) related to image rights, and declared 11.5m of earnings from 2011-14 when his real income was almost 43m.

The prosecutor also alleged that the forward falsely reported income as coming from real estate, which it said had greatly reduced his tax rate.

Ronaldo arrived in court in Madrid on Tuesday morning, wearing sunglasses and a black blazer and accompanied by his partner, Georgina Rodríguez. His request to be allowed to enter the Provincial court through an underground carpark was denied.

The brief hearing came six months after Ronaldo agreed a deal that would see him spared jail if he paid fines totalling almost 19m.

In Spain, a judge can suspend sentences for two years or less for first-time offenders.

Earlier, Ronaldos former teammate at Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso, walked in to face his own case of tax fraud, his hands deep in his suit pockets. Yes, all good, was his only response to journalists questions.

Alonso is accused of defrauding tax authorities of about 2m euros from 2010-12.

He could be sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 4m, in addition to the amount allegedly defrauded. The charges are related to Alonsos income from image rights. The retired Spain midfielder, who has denied any wrongdoing, played for Madrid from 2009-14.",am
472,"A former Mexican military leader pleaded not guilty Thursday in Brooklyn federal court to drug trafficking and money laundering charges alleging he took bribes to help drug cartels avoid prosecution.

Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, 72, nicknamed El Padrino, or the Godfather, allegedly helped leaders of the violent H-2 cartel move cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the U.S., including New York, according to the indictment.

In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartela cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murderto operate with impunity in Mexico, wrote prosecutors in a court filing.

The general, who led the countrys army for six years under former President Enrique Pena Nieto, was with his family when he was nabbed in October at the Los Angeles International Airport.

From 2012 to 2018, he oversaw the Mexican Army and the Mexican Air Force, reporting directly to the president  all while he was secretly communicating with the cartels most senior leaders, prosecutors allege.

Cienfuegos endured a major scandal in 2014 after soldiers under his command killed 22 suspects at a grain warehouse  at least eight of whom were executed after they surrendered, according to a human rights investigation.

Hes due back in court on Nov. 18.",am
473,"Days before Donald Trumps inauguration, the Office of Government Ethics released an agreement with Wilbur Ross, then the nominee to head the Commerce Department, in which the octogenarian tycoon agreed to divest from a significant number of his holdings and step down from the boards of over 20 companies in which he held financial interests. Though Rosss divestment should be considered the bare minimum for cabinet members, it nevertheless stood in contrast to the incoming presidents refusal to divest from his companies and persistent financial obfuscation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told him, You have really made a very personal sacrifice. Your service has resulted in your divesting yourself of literally hundreds of millions of dollars.

But Ross made no such sacrifice. Earlier this week, Forbes reported that Ross had maintained multiple investments that constituted significant conflicts of interest, including ownership stakes in several Chinese-owned enterprises, a Cyprian bank being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, an auto parts company affected by Trumps changes to trade policy (which Ross, as secretary of Commerce, is overseeing), and a shipping company with substantial ties to Russian oligarchs (who are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin).

The assets that Ross has formally divested, moreover, are being managed by a trustmeaning that Ross did not really divest from them at all, since he still knows which assets will return to his control when he leaves government service. Adding insult to injury, Ross even attempted to profit off his disclosures, shorting stock in the shipping company after being informed that his holdings were about to be made public last fall.

These revelations have resulted in something less than a media firestorm, thanks in large part to the outcry surrounding the Trump administrations policy of separating migrant families at the border. But Rosss brazen corruption is also part of a larger story. From EPA chief Scott Pruitts use of his office for personal gain to say nothing of his purchasing expensive lotions and tactical pants to the presidents own murky financial assets and connections, corruption is as much the story of the Trump administration as its cruelty toward minorities.

Rosss ties to Russian oligarchs were first made public last fall, when the Paradise Papers revealed that he owned a stake, via a chain of offshore investments, in Navigator Holdings, a shipping company with deep connections to Putins inner circle, including some under U.S. sanctions. I dont understand why anybody would decide to maintain this kind of relationship going into a senior government position, Daniel Fried, who served as secretary of state under George W. Bush, told The Guardian. What is he thinking? Rosss press secretary, meanwhile, dismissed the connection, claiming that Ross recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels.

But it was Rosss response to the revelation of his holdings, as revealed by Forbes, that is most shocking. Ross placed a short on Navigators stock days before his connection became publicmeaning he was betting it would fall in valuea move that essentially means he was doubling down on corruption. Whether it was lawful or not is a subject of debate, though it could fall under the category of insider trading. But it is certainly unethical behavior for a public servant, particularly a cabinet member.

Ross said that his divestment from Navigator Holdings was pre-planned, making the timing coincidental. That may very well be true, but Rosss denial contained more than a little hair-splitting. Insider trading requires action be taken based on non-public information about a particular company, Ross told CNN. The reporter contacted me to write about my personal financial holdings and not about Navigator Holdings or its prospects. I did not receive any non-public information due to my government position, nor did I receive any non-public information from a government employee. Securities laws presume that information known to or provided by a news organization is by definition public information. The fact that the reporter planned to do a story on me certainly is not market moving information.

Ross is arguing that because a news organization knew about his holdings, even though it had not made that information public, this could not be insider trading. It was, in essence, already public information. Whether that will hold up in a court of law remains to be seen.

Then theres the Luxembourg-based International Automotive Components Group (IAC), which Ross created by merging a number of auto parts companies in 2006. In the fall of last year IAC closed a joint venture with a Chinese state-owned company. As part of the deal, Forbes reports, Rosss company took a 30 percent interest alongside a state-owned company named Shanghai Shenda and got roughly $300 million in cash. This is a problem because Ross is currently investigating, at President Trumps behest, whether or not the United States should tax imports on foreign cars. Rosss findings could very well be informed by his familys holdings in IAC, which will ultimately undermine whatever Ross recommends.

While Republicans in Congress have largely looked away from corruption within the Trump administration, Ross is perhaps uniquely vulnerable here, given the general lack of appetite for a trade war with China in Congress. So far, congressional Republicans have been unable to sway the president from protectionism, but Rosss holdings have given them an opening.

The opening is even larger for Democrats, for whom corruption remains a potent message heading into the midterms (and 2020). Rosss self-dealing and conflicts of interest should be part of a larger mosaic, encompassing Trumps blatant use of the presidency for economic gain. The Russia connection, when it comes to Ross, is also tantalizing, but the larger point is this: Ross, like so many in the administration, is compromised not by connection to a foreign power, but by his own financial interest.",am
474," -- The widow of the disgraced Illinois police officer who committed suicide in September and made the incident look like a murder has been indicted by a grand jury on felony charges of money laundering, according to the Lake County Sheriffs Office.

During the investigation into the death of Fox Lake Police Lt. Joseph Gliniewicz, officials found that non-business related money had been withdrawn from the Fox Lake Police Explorer Post youth program, the sheriff's office said.

Gliniewicz's wife, 51-year-old Melodie Gliniewicz, was an adult adviser with the Fox Lake Police Explorer Post who had fiduciary responsibilities, the statement said. Joseph Gliniewicz had overseen the post for more than 20 years.

Fox Lake Cop's Personnel Files Indicate Litany of Complaints

The investigation revealed money was withdrawn from the police explorer account over the course of several years,"" said Ray Rose, an undersheriff with the Lake County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

The funds were used to pay for personal expenses, such as a trip to Hawaii as well as at Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, the Fox Lake Theatre, and more than 400 restaurants, police said.

It was not immediately clear what role Melodie Gliniewicz allegedly played in the case.

She was arrested after turning herself into the Lake County Sheriff's Office, police said. She was indicted on three counts of disbursing charitable funds without authority and for personal benefit, one count of disbursing charitable funds without authority and for personal benefit and two counts of money laundering. Her bond was set at $50,000.

This entire matter has been a sad and tragic saga for the Village of Fox Lake,"" said Lake County State's Attorney Michael Nerheim. ""My hope is that we will be able to close this unfortunate chapter and move forward with ensuring a professional and transparent police department dedicated to the citizens of Fox Lake.""

Melodie Gliniewicz's attorneys released a statement saying that she has ""suffered greatly"" and ""continues to move her family forward"" since the ""emotionally traumatizing"" death of her husband.

""Considering Melodies cooperation with law enforcement, she is devastated by the decision to bring charges against her,"" her lawyers, David P. Buckley and Andrew J. Kelleher said in a statement. ""Melodie is a victim of her husbands secret actions and looks forward to her day in Court to show the world her innocence.""",am
475,"Lai Xiaomin, former China Huarong Asset Management board chairman, has been charged with bribery, corruption and bigamy, the Supreme People's Procuratorate said on Friday.

China Huarong is one of the country's four largest State-own asset management companies.

It is alleged that Lai exploited various professional positions, including head of the Huarong corporation and director-general of the banking supervision department of the People's Bank of China.

While in these positions, it is claimed that he asked for and received significant benefits in exchange for ""aid"", according to a press release from the SPP, the country's top prosecuting authority.

It also alleged that Lai was in illegal possession of a large number of public properties, and that he was living as husband and wife with a woman other than his wife, the release said.

Lai, 56, was placed under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the Communist Party of China in April last year for ""serious violations of disciplinary rules and laws"", and was expelled from the Party and removed from public office six months later.

The CCDI said he violated political disciplines and State financial policies to blindly expand the company and operate it in a disorderly manner, resulting in it deviating from its primary tasks and business.

476,"BERLIN: Germany has issued international arrest warrants for the two founders of the firm at the centre of the tax haven scandal exposed by the Panama Papers data leak, German media reported.

Mossack Fonseca founders Juergen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, suspected of tax evasion and associating with criminals, will be arrested if they enter the European Union, German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported late on Monday (Oct 19).

The two men hold Panamanian passports and are currently in the Caribbean archipelago which does not have any extradition treaties, the newspaper said.

However investigators hope that Mossack, who has family in Germany, may surrender to officials in order to negotiate a reduced sentence and avoid US charges.

The Panama Papers, a massive data leak in April 2016, exposed widespread tax avoidance and evasion using complex structures of offshore shell companies and caused an international outcry.

At least 150 investigations have been opened in 79 countries to examine potential tax evasion or money laundering, according to the American Center for Public Integrity.

In 2018, Mossack Fonseca said it would close due to ""irreparable damage"" to its reputation. Panama's government meanwhile continues to petition the international community to remove it from several tax haven blacklists.",am
477,"Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko has initiated impeachment proceedings against the sitting president Petro Poroshenko  a little more than a month before the two go head to head in elections.

Ms Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, made her move on the back of a new investigation that linked Mr Poroshenkos entourage to an embezzlement scheme involving the smuggling of military spare parts from Russia.

Speaking in the Verkhovna Rada  Ukraine s parliament  on Tuesday, Ms Tymoshenko said the findings were consistent with state treason.

Given the lack of time before the elections and parliamentary arithmetic which still favours the president, the move has little prospect for success.

But the scandal has hit Mr Poroshenko just at a moment when he appeared to be gaining electoral momentum  if polls are to be believed, pipping Ms Tymoshenko to second spot behind comedian Volodymyr Zelensky. The fall-out may yet decide who wins on 31 March.

For a country at war, the revelations made in the investigation are shocking enough.

The authors of the report, a group of independent Ukrainian journalists, link a close Poroshenko associate with fraudulent arms contracts that eventually cost the military £7 million.

The scheme involved the selling of spare parts for tanks at three times market value. Not only this, the parts were smuggled in from Russia, a hostile power.

While the contracts were signed by a 27-year-old called Ihor Hladovsky, the investigation concludes that they were in fact facilitated by his father, Oleh Hladovskiy, the deputy chair of Ukraine's security council and a key presidential ally.

Profits were siphoned away through three companies, including one that earlier belonged to the president. This, the journalists suggested, was evidence the corruption likely went higher.

Speaking with The Independent, journalist Denys Bihous, who led the investigation, said President Poroshenko was implicated by design.

If he really didnt want to know about it, then hed find a way of not knowing about it, he said. But Hladkovskiy is an old, old friend. He got his government job because of this friendship.

Sergii Leshchenko, a member of parliament and a Poroshenko critic, described Mr Hladkovskiy as one of the presidents closest associates in politics  pointing to how the two had bought holiday homes close to each other in Marbella.

This isnt the first time president had been implicated in corruption, he said, but what gives the revelations more weight is that they come a month before elections, concern corruption in the military sphere, and involve Russia.

According to Mr Leshchenko, still notionally a member of Mr Poroshenkos fraction in parliament, Ms Tymoshenkos proposal was a fair price for what the president had done. Mr Poroshenko deserved not only impeachment but jail, he said.

In a sign of the seriousness of the scandal engulfing Ukraines president, on Tuesday Oleh Hladkovskiy was temporarily suspended from his position on the Ukrainian Security Council.

Writing on Facebook, spokesman Svyatoslav Tsegolko said that Mr Poroshenko supported the suspension. He also asked law enforcement to undergo an urgent review of the information contained in the investigation.

Those concessions are unlikely to make Mr Poroshenko's problem disappear.

On Tuesday, another presidential rival, the Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi, piled on the pressure by concurring Mr Poroshenko had committed an offence impeachable in any other country.  But his solution was not the PR favoured by Ms Tymoshenko.

Instead, Ukrainians should to declare their own impeachment on 31 March.

Mayor Sadovyi remains a rank outsider for the presidential post. Ms Tymoshenko, on the other hand, will hope her intuitive move will reverse what had up to now been a disappointing campaign. In the space of a month, the one-time poll frontrunner has seen her rating overtaken by her two main rivals  comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and now incumbent Petro Poroshenko too.

Bihous said he had few illusions about the electoral sensitivity of his work.

In the days leading up to publication, their office was conspicuously staked out by security officers, he said. They arrived in cars with replacement number-plates, ""disappearing only when we approached.""",am

(Pashto: ?????? ????????; Persian: ?????? ????????; born 1 August 1949) [2] is an Afghan politician and former Mujahideen Leader. He is the founder and current leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party (so-called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezbi Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis). [3] [4] He has twice served as Prime Minister of Afghanistan during the 1990s.

Hekmaytar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s in the era after Ayub Khan, where he was known for his Islamic renaissance thoughts rejected by a traditionalist Islamic faction of the organization. He spent time in Pakistan as he was searched by Daoud Regime, before returning to Afghanistan when the SovietAfghan War began in 1979, at which time he and his Hezb-e Islami organization quickly started resistance to Soviet Invasion. [5] Seeing his advances in resistance movement, the US and Saudis shifted their funding to Hizb-e Islami in mid 1980s. Due to his success on the war field and large resistance area held, he received more International funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War. [6]

Following the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar was at first inclined to become part of the Interim government. But due to the involvement of many international powers (US, UK, and France in particular) in intra-Afghan dialogues and strong disagreements between different Mujahideen groups over many Government Posts and power-sharing in the interim Government, Hekmatyar stepped down from the interim Government as to him, International agencies (allegedly the CIA, MI6 and ISI) were preparing an unfair plan for power-sharing in the Government. And, that the dialogues were delay tactics to allow Massoud and his allies to advance to Kabul and seize the city. [5] Hekmatyar then got engaged in Afghan civil war in hope of capturing Kabul before Massoud. The civil war lead to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused in west of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city, although Shia Militias, Doustum and Massoud's forces were already in fierce battle for the control of city, before Hekmatyar had jumped into war. [7] In the meantime, as a part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996, before the Taliban takeover of Kabul forced him to leave Afghanistan to Iran 's capital Tehran. [8]

After the Taliban's fall in 2001 he went to Pakistan and later Afghanistan, to reorganize his paramilitary forces and start resistance movement against the Karzai Government and the invading ISAF (International coalition) forces. [9] In 2016, he signed a peace deal with the Government of Ashraf Ghani and returned to Afghanistan after almost 20 years in exile and resistance. [10]

Early life[ edit ]

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1949 in Imam Saheb, Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. [11] [4] His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the Ghazni province. [12] Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his Islamic political views two years later. [12] [13] From 1969 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University 's engineering department. During his first year at the university he wrote a 149-page book entitled The Priority of Sense Over Matter, where he refutes communists denying the existence of God by quoting European philosophers and scientists like Hegel or Francesco Redi. [14] Though he did not complete his degree, his followers still address him as ""Engineer Hekmatyar"". [12] [13] [15]

During his years in university, Hekmatyar joined the Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman (""Organization of Muslim Youth"") [12] which was gaining influence because of its opposition to the Soviet influence in Afghanistan increasing through the PDPA elements in Daoud's government. He was one of the foundational members of the organization. [16] [17] He may have also been influenced by the ideological teachings of Muslim Brotherhood member Sayyid Qutb. [18] By his own account he became an Islamist when he heard of Qutb's death in 1966, on radio, and also contradicts the fact that he ever was a communist during his youth. [19] Although some make a claim that Hekmatyar threw acid at multiple female students, but this claim is largely attributed to as Soviet KGB 's black propaganda even by his strong rivals. [20]

Hekmatyar's Islamic Revolutionary mindset put him in confrontation with elements in the Muslim Youth surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud, also an engineering student at Kabul University. In 1975, the ""Islamic Society"" split between supporters of Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-e Islami, and elements surrounding Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who then founded the Hezb-i Islami. Akbarzadeh and Yasmeen describe Hekmatyar's approach as ""radical"" and antagonistic as opposed to an ""inclusive"" and ""moderate"" strategy by Rabbani. [21] While others describe Massoud in Rabbani's side as having ethnic germs rather than having an Islamic inclusive approach.

The arrival of Afghan opposition militants in Peshawar coincided with a period of diplomatic tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan, due to Daoud's revival of the Pashtunistan issue. [ citation needed ] Under the secret policy of the United States and Britain, and the patronage of Pakistani General Naseerullah Babar, then governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and with the blessing of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, camps were set up to train Hekmatyar and other anti-Daoud Islamists. [22] The Islamist movement had two main tendencies: the Jamiat-e islami (""Islamic society"") led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, that advocated a gradualist strategy to gain power, through infiltration of society and the state apparatus. Rabbani advocated for the ""building of a widely based movement that would create popular support"". [23] The other movement, called Hezb-i Islami (""Islamic Party""), was led by Hekmatyar, who favored a radical approach in the form of violent armed conflict. Pakistani support largely went to Hekmatyar's group, who, in October 1975, undertook to instigate an uprising against the government. Without popular support, the rebellion ended in complete failure, and hundreds of militants were arrested. [24]

Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami was formed as an elitist avant-garde based on a strictly disciplined Islamist ideology within a homogeneous organization that Olivier Roy described as "" Leninist"", and employed the rhetoric of the Iranian Revolution. [25] It had its operational base in the Nasir Bagh, Worsak and Shamshatoo refugee camps in Pakistan. In these camps, Hezb-i Islami formed a social and political network and operated everything from schools to prisons, with the support of the Pakistani government and their Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). [26] [27] From 19761977 Afghan President Daoud made overtures to Pakistan which led to reconciliation with Pakistani leader Bhutto. [23] Bhutto's support to Hekmatyar, however, continued and when Bhutto was removed from power in Pakistan by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, Zia continued supporting Hekmatyar. [28]

Soviet war in Afghanistan[ edit ]

Hekmatyar and his Hizb-e Islami along with Jamiat e Islami, Harkat-einqalab Islami etc fought by their own limited sources and some assistance from Pakistan from 1978 till 1983-1984. It was then in 1984 when the international community particularly United States, England, France and Middle Eastern Arab Countries took interest in Soviet-Afghan War. With everyone having their own interests in the war, International community aided various Mujahideen groups with weapons, money and Media support.

In the later half of the SovietAfghan War, Hekmatyar received aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States. [29] [30] According to the ISI, their decision to allocate the highest percentage of covert aid to Hekmatyar was based on his record as an effective and most Popular anti-Soviet and Anti-communist military commander in Afghanistan. [31] Others describe his position as the result of having ""almost no grassroots support and no military base inside Afghanistan"", and thus being the much more ""dependent on Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq 's protection and financial largesse"" than other mujahideen factions. [32]

Warfare with other Afghan groups[ edit ]

Hekmatyar has been harshly criticized [ by whom? ] for his behavior during the Soviet war and the civil war, and was criticized for his group's ""xenophobic"" tendencies. [33] At various times, he both fought against and allied himself with almost every other group in Afghanistan. He ordered frequent attacks on other rival factions to weaken them in order to improve his position in the post-Soviet power vacuum. An example of his tendency for internecine rivalry was his arranging the arrest of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Pakistan in 1976 on spying charges. [34] Another example is when Massoud and Hekmatyar agreed to stage a takeover operation in the Panjshir valley Hekmatyar at the last minute refused to engage his part of the offensive, leaving Massoud open and vulnerable. Massoud's forces barely escaped with their lives. [35] In 1987, members of Hekmatyar's faction killed British cameraman Andy Skrzypkowiak, who was carrying footage of Massoud's successes to the West. Despite protests from British representatives, Hekmatyar did not punish the culprits, and instead rewarded them with gifts. [36] Another example of the Hezb-i Islami's tendency to internecine fighting was given on 9 July 1989, when Sayyed Jamal, one of Hekmatyar's commanders, ambushed and killed 30 commanders of Massoud's Shura-ye-Nazar at Farkhar in Takhar province. The attack was typical of Hekmatyar's strategy of trying to cripple rival factions, and incurred widespread condemnation among the mujahideen. [37]

Another possible instance of Hekmatyar's treachery [ peacock term ] toward his rivals occurred in 1987. The Paris-based group Médecins Sans Frontières reported that Hekmatyar's guerrillas hijacked a 96-horse caravan bringing aid into northern Afghanistan in 1987, stealing a year's supply of medicine and cash that was to be distributed to villagers. This would have allowed the villagers to buy food. French relief officials also asserted that Thierry Niquet, an aid coordinator bringing cash to Afghan villagers, was killed by one of Hekmatyar's commanders in 1986. It is thought that two American journalists traveling with Hekmatyar in 1987, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were killed not by the Soviets, as Hekmatyar's men claimed, but during a firefight initiated by Hekmatyar's forces against another mujahideen group. [38] In addition, there were frequent reports throughout the war of Hekmatyar's commanders negotiating and dealing with pro-Communist local militias in northern Afghanistan. [39]

Hekmatyar made an unlikely alliance with hardline communist and Minister of Defence Shahnawaz Tanai who launched a failed coup attempt in March 1990 against President Najibullah.

Hekmatyar has been accused of spending ""more time fighting other Mujahideen than killing Soviets."" [40] Hekmatyar remains a controversial figure [41] - the New York Times once described him as ""perhaps the most brutal of a generally brutal group"". [42]

Further information: Civil war in Afghanistan (199296)

A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the ""Butcher of Kabul"", accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s. [43]

According to the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan in 19891992, Peter Tomsen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hired in 1990 by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to conquer and rule Afghanistan in the benefit of Pakistani interests, which plan was delayed until 1992 due to US pressure to cancel that plan.

In April 1992, as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan began to collapse, government officials joined the mujahideen, choosing different parties according to their ethnic and political affinities. For the most part, the members of the khalq faction of the PDPA, who were predominantly Pashtuns, joined with Hekmatyar. [45] With their help, he began on 24 April to infiltrate troops into Kabul, and announced that he had seized the city, and that should any other leaders try to fly into Kabul, he would shoot their plane down. [46] The new leader of the ""Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan"", Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, appointed Ahmad Shah Massoud as defense minister, and urged him to take action. This he did, taking the offensive on 25 April, and after two days heavy fighting, the Hezb-i Islami and its allies were expelled from Kabul. [47] A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi's plane. [3] The following day, fighting resumed between Burhanuddin Rabbani 's and Ahmed Shah Massoud's Jamiat, Abdul Rashid Dostum 's Jumbish forces and Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami forces.

From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands, most of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction, but Hekmatyar's group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas. [48] Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants' collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a New York Times journalist that Afghanistan ""already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic."" [49] His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population. [50] In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as Hizb-e-Wahdat, a Hazara Shi'a party, to form the Shura-i Hamahangi (""Council of coordination""). Together they laid Siege on Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum's troops from the capital. [51]

The Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul, which would be friendly to their interests. By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun Taliban. [52] After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-i Islami positions. They captured Wardak on 2 February 1995, and moved on to Maidan Shahr on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed. [53] On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to Surobi. [54]

Nonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar's attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar's weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women's dress, that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital. [55] The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996. Many of the HIG local commanders joined the Taliban ""both out of ideological sympathy and for reason of tribal solidarity."" [56] Those that did not were expelled by the Taliban. In Pakistan Hezb-e-Islami training camps ""were taken over by the Taliban and handed over"" to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) groups such as the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). [57] Hekmatyar then fled to Massoud's stronghold in Panjshir who, despite Hekmatyar's history of animosity towards him, helped him flee to Iran in 1997 where he is said to have resided for almost six years. [58] Isolated from Afghanistan he is reported to have ""lost ... his power base back home"" to defections or inactivity of former members. He was also distrusted by the Iranian Government who found him too unpredictable, unreliable, and an unnecessary liability, considering its tense relations at the time with the Taliban and the Pakistani government, and despite his pleas, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards refused to establish a proxy through any of his organizations or assist him in any way. [59] Allegedly, they even cut his phone lines and turned away anyone who wished to see him in his villa in North Tehran. [60]

Post-9/11 activities[ edit ]

After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly ""worked closely"" with bin Laden in early 1990s, [61] declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N. -brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts. [4]

The United States accused Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He was also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai 's government. ISAF identified Hekmatyar in 2002 as the number one security threat, ahead of the Taliban or al-Qaeda. [62] He was also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai in Kandahar and a bomb the same day that killed more than a dozen people in Kabul. [63] [64] That same month, he released newsletters and tape messages calling for jihad against the United States. One of his commanders commented that there ""will be suicide attacks [...] against soldiers"". [65] On 25 December 2002 news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces. [ citation needed ]

On February 10, 2003 the Afghan government reported that Hekmatyar was planning an alliance with Taliban and al-Qaeda factions. His group was involved in an intense battle with the U.S. army near Spin Boldak. [66] On February 19, 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a ""global terrorist."" [ clarification needed ] [67] This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the U.S., or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners. [ citation needed ]

In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. [68] In an audiotape released the same month, he called for revolt against U.S. forces and Karzai's ""pupper government"", and directly threatened to kill Lt. General Karl Eikenberry. [69] In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted. [70] In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar claimed ""the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well."" In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed ""that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago."" BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, ""We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place."" [71]

2008 resurgence[ edit ]

In May 2008, the Jamestown Foundation reported that after being ""sidelined from Afghan politics"" since the mid-1990s, Gulbuddin's HIG group had ""recently reemerged as an aggressive militant group, claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces at the time, primarily the International Security Assistance Force and the administration of President Hamid Karzai."" The re-emergence of him as an ""experienced guerrilla strategist"" came at a propitious time for insurgency, following the killing of Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, when some elements of the Taliban were becoming ""disorganized and frustrated."" [4] HIG claimed responsibility for and is thought to have at least assisted in a 27 April 2008 attempt on the life of President Karzai in Kabul that killed three Afghan citizens, including a member of parliament. Other attacks it was thought to be responsible for include the 2 January 2008 shooting down in Laghman province of a helicopter containing foreign troops; the shooting and forcing down of a U.S. military helicopter in Sarubi district of Kabul on 22 January; and blowing up a Kabul police vehicle in March 2008, killing 10 soldiers. [4]

In interviews he demanded ""all foreign forces to leave immediately unconditionally."" Offers by President Hamid Karzai to open talks with ""opponents of the government"" and hints that they would be offered official posts ""such as deputy minister or head of department"", were thought to be directed at Hekmatyar. It was reported in 2008 that Hekmatyar lived in an unknown location in southeastern Afghanistan, close to the Pakistani border. [4] In 2008, he denied any links with the Taliban or al-Qaeda and was even considered for Prime Minister. [72] At the time, Hekmatyar was believed to shuttle between hideouts in Pakistan's mountainous tribal areas and northeast Afghanistan. [73]

In January 2010, he was still considered as one of the three main leaders of the Afghan insurgency. By then, he held out the possibility of negotiations with President Karzai and outlined a roadmap for political reconciliation. This contrasted with the views of Taliban leader Mullah Omar and allied insurgent chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who refused any talks with Kabul as long as foreign troops remain in the country, Hekmatyar appeared less reluctant. [74]

On 10 February 2014, Gulbuddin's HIG group executed an attack which killed two US civilians, Paul Goins and Michael Hughes, and wounded two other Americans and seven Afghan nationals. HIG was also responsible for a 16 May 2013 suicide VBIED attack in Kabul, which destroyed a US armored SUV and killed two US soldiers, four US civilian contractors, eight Afghansincluding two childrenand wounded at least 37 others. The attack marked the deadliest incident against US personnel in Kabul in 2013.

2016 peace deal and pardon[ edit ]

On 22 September 2016, Hekmatyar was pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal between Hezb-i-Islami and the government. The deal also allowed for the release of Hezb-i-Islami prisoners and the return of Hekmatyar to public life. The deal led a group of young activists to organise a protest against the pardoning less than a mile away from the signing ceremony. Human Rights Watch called the deal ""an affront to victims of grave abuses"". [75] Hezb-i-Islami agreed to cease hostilities, cut ties to extremist groups and respect the Afghan Constitution in exchange for government recognition of the group and support for the removal of United Nations and American sanctions against Hekmatyar, who was also promised an honorary post in the government. [76] [77]

The agreement was formalised on 29 September 2016 with both Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Hekmatyar, who appeared via a video link in the presidential palace, signing the agreement. [78] UN sanctions on him were formally lifted on 3 February 2017. [79] On 4 May 2017, he returned to Kabul along with his fighters to meet President Ghani after spending two decades in hiding. [80]

Some of Gulbuddin's relatives have served or are suspected of serving as his deputies.

479,"Commonwealth Games Scam

Commonwealth Games is an international meet of sports in which a number of events are held. Initially, it was known as the British Empire Games but later the name was changed and it is held in every 4 years.

This means that the next Commonwealth Games will be held in 2022. Athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations can participate in it. In the year 2010, it was held in India and though the nation was able to put up a spectacular show before the globe, it definitely held its head in shame internally because of the scam that followed the grand affair.

Commonwealth Games shook everyone

The President that time was Pratibha Patil while Congress was the ruling party. It is no secret that there have been a number of scams when the Congress was ruling the nation, however, the massive amount involved in the Commonwealth Games shook everyone. It totally changed the thought that India is a poor country.

It is reported that the expenditure to organize the magnificent show at Delhi was nothing less than INR 70,000 crores. There were a number of people involved behind the success and months of planning had been put in. but, here is exactly where the catch it.

Representing Commonwealth Games Scam

It is said that it is absolutely not true that the government actually spent so much. It is said that the officials of the government actually lied and created fake documents. There are accusations that a number of people in high posts and positions misused their power and actually presented tampered records of the expenditure done. They filled their pockets at the cost of the public. The bills and prices shown were definitely inflated. In fact, it has been investigated and actually found that just 50% of the stated amount was actually spent.

The nation then wishes to know that what happened to their hard-earned money. This is because it is the taxes paid by the common man that was spent on just pomp and show.

The nation still demands to know that if so much can be spent on games and just to maintain the reputation of a nation on an international scale, then why can the government not take any necessary steps and utilize this money to provide education to the masses and start industries on their own so that the mass scale problem of unemployment in India can be fought back without any issues.

The CommonWealth Scam of India

In fact, this is not it. The Commonwealth scam of India has also received international news space. This was because though the officials had been careful enough to spend on the fireworks and the lights, they had miserably failed in providing adequate facilities to the sports persons.

Conclusion

In fact, the same has been the complain of India players and sportsmen who are in a field other than cricket. Since news is timely, media soon moved their focus on to other news that came up. However, the masses have not forgotten this betrayal and are not likely to let go of it either. On the contrary, Suresh Kalmadi, one of the chief suspects for the scam, was appointed as the life president of Indian Olympic Association in 2016.",am
480,"HISTORY

The Commonwealth Games scam in the year 2010 in New Delhi is one of the most well known scam of India whose main accused being Suresh Kalmadi, the chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth scam involves a pilferage of about nearly Rs 70,000 crores. A number of corrupt deals have happened in the CWG including overstated contracts. Even before the grand event was in the lime light it was exposed to more of proclamation of dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power. It is estimated that out of Rs. 70000 crores spent on the Games, only half the said amount was spent on Indian sportspersons. Reports based on investigation states that Suresh Kalmadi gave nearly Rs 141 crores contract to Swiss Timing for its timing equipment and the deal was excessively or unreasonably high by Rs 95 crores.

THE CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION

Just 10 days before the Commonwealth games was about to start the athletes were made to shift from the apartments which were exclusively meant for them. They were moved on to very shabby and run down apartments. The Central Vigilance Commission, which was investigating the professed dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power in various Commonwealth Games related projects, had found lack of compatibility in tenders like payment to non-existent parties, will-full delays in execution of contracts, over-inflated price and bungling in purchase of equipment through tendering and misappropriation of funds.

PEOPLE INVOLVED

There is a big list of people including Politicians, Bureaucrats, and Businessmen who were involved in the Commonwealth scam. Apart from the people there was also a number of major corporations who played a role in the Commonwealth scam. Some of the top politicians who were involved in the scam are Suresh Kalmadi who acclaims to be the main accused. He was the representative of the Congress party to the 15th Lok Sabha from the Pune constituency. He was the Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Delhi Commonwealth games. According to the reports submitted by the Shunglu committee and from the office of Comptroller and Auditor General, the then Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit was also charged with a number of evidence of fraud and irregularities related to the Commonwealth Games process. The other main political head who was involved in the scam was Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President, Ms. Sonia Gandhi.

The bureaucrats whose names were listed in the Commonwealth scam are Lalit Bhanot, Secretary General of the Organizing committee, TS Darbari, Joint Director General of the Organizing committee, Sanjay Mahindroo, Deputy Director General of the Organizing committee, BS Lalli, CEO of Prasar Bharati and M Jayachandran, Joint Director General of Accounts and Finance Department. Apart from the personal involvement of people in the scam there were also a number of Organizations or Corporations who were involved in the scam and they are AM Films, AM Cars, SIS Live, MTNL, HCL Info systems, Sweka Powerteck Engineers Pvt Ltd. Jaypee group was another major organization which was claimed to have the proceeds of corruption which are parked here through financial involvement of Suresh Kalmadi's son, Sumeer Kalmadi in the F1 circuit project at Greater Noida. Among the list of the businessmen who also played a role in the Commonwealth games are RSP Sinha, MTNL CMD, and SM Talwar who was the Executive director of MTNL, NK Jain, and General Manager of MTNL in the department of Corporate Sales and finally Jitendra Garg, the Deputy General Manager of MTNL.

BEST PART OF SCAM WAS THAT IT WAS SCOOPED OUT BY THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL

The best part of the scam was that it was scooped out by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India even before the Commonwealth games was started. Suresh Kamahi did lot of action of manipulation in a clever and unscrupulous way by his team and supposed to have unfairly taken a huge amount of money in the name of Commonwealth games. Kalmadi had been accused of awarding illegal contracts to a Swiss firm for Timing-Scoring-Result system for the Games causing a loss of Rs 95 crores to the exchequer. It has been reported by the Enforcement Directorate that during the Queens Baton Relay held in London prior to the Commonwealth Games lot of funds and forex had come in and has been misappropriated by Suresh Kalmadi and his team. This has been probed under the grounds of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act which falls under the overlays-related works of the Games, under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE ALSO FILLED CHARGE SHEETS

the Enforcement Directorate also filed charge sheets against Suresh Kalmadi based on the British Authorities who reported to the Indian High Commission that the team headed by Suresh Kalamdi hired a London-based transport firm AM Cars and Vans at exorbitant prices. There are also reports submitted which state that just like heavy payments given to AM cars, unreasonably high payments were made to AM Films for installing video screens at the venue of the Queen's Baton Relay. Another case regarding the Commonwealth Games scam is also registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation against the officials of Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited, or MTNL, and a Noida based company named HCL Infosystems for setting up a broadcast network for the games at an extremely high price of about nearly Rs 400 crores. The probne into the Commonwealth scam also claims that MTNL assigned the work of broadcast network based on IP/MPLS Technology at an inflated price of approximately Rs 570.12 crores by manipulating specifications in such a manner as to make them tailor made for the said bidder to the said private company (HCL).

INVESTIGATION REPORT

Various reports submitted by the different committees investigating the Commonwealth scam all clearly stated that there were several complaints based on the violation of norms in the process of recruiting officers for the Commonwealth games. The Central Vigilance Commission claims that rules were not followed in the process of appointments. The CVC also stated that the muster rolls shows names of non- existing employee names thereby violating norms while inducting people. Also the Central Bureau of Investigation stated that during the period of 2003- 2009 various appointments were made for the Organizing Committee who had no expertise for their concerned posting. The Games' organizing body had an overall strength of about 2,100 officials engaged for various duties related to the mega sporting event. But during the probe, there were only about 100 officials on the rolls.The Organizing Committee of the Commonwealth games was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the deals which had been signed with media channels. The contract which was signed for this was about Rs. 6.73 crores.",am

482,"WASHINGTON--()--The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has expelled New York-based Halcyon Cabot Partners, Ltd., and barred Chief Executive Officer Michael Morris and Chief Compliance Officer Ronald Heineman from the securities industry, for fraud, sales practice abuses, and widespread supervisory and anti-money laundering failures. FINRA found that Halcyon, Morris and Heineman engaged in a scheme to conceal a kickback of private placement fees.

FINRAs investigation found that Halcyon, Morris and Heineman, along with a previously barred registered representative, Craig Josephberg, agreed to conceal the discount the issuer provided to a venture capital firm when it purchased a private placement in a cancer drug development company. The scheme was effected through a bogus placement fee agreement that was entered into after the venture capital firm had already agreed to purchase the entirety of the offerings. Halcyon did not perform any work, as there was already a buyer in place, but rather returned almost all of its $1.75 million placement fee to the investor through sham consulting agreements. This fraudulent scheme allowed the drug company to conceal that it was selling its shares at a discount.

Brad Bennett, FINRAs Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, ""This sham placement arrangement allowed the investor to conceal the kickback of the placement fee and thus deceive the market into believing that the shares were being sold at the full offering price. These actions were consistent with the culture of non-compliance fostered by Halcyon and its principals, which manifested itself in widespread sales practice abuses and AML violations that are also detailed in this case.

In addition to the kickback scheme, FINRA also found that Halcyon and Morris enabled a now-expelled broker-dealer, Felix Investments, LLC, to collect undisclosed commissions. Pursuant to an agreement between Halcyon and Felix, Felix charged buyer commissions and Halcyon charged seller commissions on a transaction, despite the fact Halcyon did not provide any services to the sellers. Halcyon then secretly shared the sellers commissions with Felix.

FINRA also found that Morris falsified Halcyons books and records to conceal Josephbergs sales of securities in states where he was not registered, including Florida, Texas and Colorado. Halcyon also failed to supervise Josephberg, who churned retail customer accounts and effected unauthorized trades.

In concluding this settlement, Halcyon Cabot Partners, Morris and Heineman neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

FINRAs investigation was conducted by the Departments of Enforcement and Member Regulation.

483,"According to Ripple, this lawsuit calls on the video platform to do a number of things.

It says: First, to be more aggressive and proactive in identifying these scams, before theyre posted. Second, faster removal of these scams once they are identified and lastly, to not profit from these scams.

As reported last month, Ripples CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter to warn users that a fake account was on YouTube and impersonating him with the promise of an XRP giveaway.

In this latest development, Garlinghouse is again out of justice on Twitter.

He comments: Across the industry, social media companies have failed to police their platforms from being abused by the entirely preventable imposter giveaway scams. Hundreds of people (including some of you) have been hurt, yet big tech continues to drag their feet.

Garlinghouse is not a happy chappy and calls YouTubes platform the epicentre for imposter scams and theyve done next to nothing in response to our constant takedown requests.

Its not just YouTube he rails against. Bizarrely, Instagram told him he wasnt being impersonated, despite clear evidence to the contrary.

In the official Ripple announcement, it asks for an industry wide-behaviour change and an expectation of accountability.

It also points out that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released COVID-19 scam reports, by the numbers. This publication shares that, as of 1 January, consumers reported financial losses of over $13M to COVID-19 related fraud.

In response to the XRP-specific giveaway scams and impersonations, Ripple says it hired an external cybersecurity and digital threat intelligence vendor to help with reporting and takedown efforts, in addition to building its own submission form for the community to report unusual activity.

484,"Market manipulation is nothing new, and both, banks and whales, are known for moving the prices whenever they feel the need to do so. The same is likely true for the cryptocurrency space as well. However, the latest case of market manipulation actually concerns the traditional markets.

As a result, two large banks  JPMorgan and Citigroup  ended up being sued for violating anti-monopoly laws. To settle these accusations, the two will have to pay around $182.5 million in total. The settlement, as usual, allows the banks to settle these matters without admitting guilt. The same is happening with other banks that found themselves in a similar situation.

Some examples include settlements reached by Barclays Pic, that has to pay $94 million, HSBC Holdings, which has to pay $45 million, as well as Deutsche Bank AG, with a $170 million-large settlement.

Euribor vs Libor
As for the newest lawsuit, it was launched by pension funds and an investor group, that have accused banks of collaborating in order to manipulate the Euribor benchmark. They claim that these events took place between June 2005 and March 2011. As a result, the banks were capable of manipulating the derivatives market, and make a profit while the investors ended up being damaged.

Euribor (European Interbank Offered Rate) represents the total of borrowed money in the entire European market. While the Euribors purpose is to show the real market situation, it appears that numerous member banks can easily collaborate in order to affect the market behind the scenes.

Examples of banks trying to rig the game against borrowers are plentiful, with the most famous one being the LIBOR scandal. Many remember it well to this day, as this case was exposed 10 years ago, in 2008. Back then, it was revealed that the UK banks have been providing deliberate misstatements regarding their borrowers costs on regular basis. The purpose of this was to shape the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the GBP-denominated index similar to Euribor itself.

Libor serves as a benchmark for numerous financial products, and so manipulating the Libor rates has directly affected things such as mortgages, student loans, and more. This also included a $350 trillion-large US derivatives market.

Arguably the worst part was the discovery that such Libor manipulations were not a one-time thing. In fact, it was reported to be a common practice ever since 1991. As soon as the scandal was made public, guilty parties had billions of dollars in fines to pay, and the industry lost the ability to self-regulate. The new benchmark is, instead, always calculated with the UK regulators overseeing the process.

While similar in many ways, the Euribor incident is much smaller than the Libor scandal. However, it still shows that banks are ready, willing, and able to manipulate markets for years, as well as that they are capable of hiding such activities even from financial regulators.",am

486,"MADRID -- Police in Italy, Spain and Germany have arrested 32 people suspected of trafficking drugs and laundering money in a European operation against the Camorra crime syndicate.

A drug seizure two years ago prompted the investigation by the Anti-Mafia Prosecution Office in Naples that led to Wednesday's arrest in three countries, said Eurojust, a The Hague-based agency that coordinates the fight against organized crime across European borders.

Naples has been the traditional base for the Mafia-type Camorra syndicate, an umbrella for many different clans.

Spain's State prosecutor office said that 14 people were arrested Wednesday in the northeastern city of Barcelona, including 10 Italians, a Chilean, a Colombian, a Spaniard and a Venezuelan.

Police in Barcelona raided several premises, including store rooms and restaurants, believed to be linked to the syndicate. According to Eurojust, the suspects allegedly sent large quantities of cocaine and hashish to Italy and reinvested the benefits in food businesses, jewelry, cars and football.

The EU agency said that police had made other arrests in Germany and Italy. It said nearly a ton of drugs and 5 million euros ($5.6 million) in cash were seized in the three European countries.",am
487,"Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday arrested Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, in connection with the ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case probe, officials said.

They said Deepak Kochhar was arrested in Mumbai under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the agency is expected to produce him before a local court on Tuesday to seek his custody.

Officials said Deepak Kochhar was placed under arrest as the agency wants to put him under custodial interrogation to obtain more details about some fresh evidence gathered in this case, that was filed under the criminal sections of the anti-money laundering law in January last year.

The ED had filed its case after studying an FIR registered by the CBI against the couple, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others.

It slapped money laundering charges against the Kochhars and their business entities for ""illegal sanctioning of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group of companies"".

The ED had earlier said an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan amount of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Limited, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) by Videocon Industries Limited on 8 September, 2009, just a day after disbursement of the loan by ICICI Bank. NRPL was earlier known as NuPower Renewables Limited (NRL) and is a company of Deepak Kochhar.

The agency had alleged that the ""net revenue of Rs 10.65 crore was generated by NRL from these tainted funds"".

""Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74.65 crore were transferred to or to say generated in NRPL,"" the ED had claimed.

The ED, early this year, also attached assets  including a Mumbai flat where the couple lived, land, and plant and machinery of a wind farm project based in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra  valued at Rs 78 crore ""in possession of"" Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and the companies owned and controlled by him.

It had said Chanda Kochhar and her family ""acquired"" the Mumbai apartment, owned by one of the Videocon Group companies, by way of ""acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price and by creating book entries"".

The couple has been questioned by the central probe agency multiple times in the past at its offices in Mumbai and Delhi.

The CBI, in its FIR, had named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot and his companies  Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL).

It also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and Nupower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in its FIR.

The CBI slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.

The CBI alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar's company Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy, a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on 1 May, 2009.

The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI had alleged.

During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank.

""Existing outstanding in the accounts of these private group companies were adjusted in Rupee Term Loan of Rs 1,730 crore sanctioned by ICICI Bank under refinance of domestic debt under consortium arrangement on 26 April, 2012,"" a CBI spokesperson had said.

The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of Rs 1,730 crore to the bank, it had alleged.",am
488,"Greenbelt, Maryland  A federal jury in Maryland yesterday convicted Nigerian national Seun Banjo Ojedokun, age 37, for a money laundering conspiracy related to a romance scam and other fraud schemes.

The conviction was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur and Special Agent in Charge Jennifer C. Boone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.

U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur stated, This defendant was part of a conspiracy that stole from many vulnerable and elderly victims across the United States, defrauding them through lies and laundering the funds internationally. The deceit used to steal from these victims was heartless, considering how vulnerable and financially devastated they were. Ojedokun was in Nigeria when he was committing these crimes. Law enforcement was able to arrest him when he came to the United States to attend school here. The U.S. Attorneys Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing to justice fraudsters who prey upon the elderly. We will continue our outreach efforts to make the public aware of scams and frauds targeting elderly victims and encourage anyone who believes they may be a victim to contact the newly launched Elder Fraud Hotline at 833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311).

These targeted scams are all to prevalent and the FBI, along with our law enforcement partners, are diligently working to alert and protect the public from falling victim, said Jennifer C. Boone, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. The arrest and conviction of Mr. Ojedokun, who was operating in Nigeria during the conspiracy, demonstrates the lengths that the FBI will go in order to hold accountable the people who commit these heinous crimes.

According to the evidence presented at his six-day trial, between 2013 and March 2015, Ojedokun conspired with Gbenga Benson Ogundele, Mukhtar Danjuma Haruna, a/k/a Mukky, and others to use money deposited into bank accounts by fraud victims to engage in financial transactions in order to promote the fraud scheme and conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the fraud proceeds.

According to evidence presented at trial, members of the conspiracy searched online dating websites to initiate romantic relationships with vulnerable men and women. They phoned, e-mailed, texted and used Internet chat messenger services to form romantic relationships with the victims, who lived throughout the United States.

Specifically, witnesses testified that members of the conspiracy used false stories and promises to convince the many victims to provide money to the conspirators, including fake hospital bills, plane trips to visit the victims, problems with overseas businesses, and foreign taxes. Ogundele and other conspirators opened bank accounts, called drop accounts, in order to receive millions of dollars from the victims. Testimony at trial showed that victims provided money to the conspirators as a result of the false stories and promises, either depositing money directly into drop accounts controlled by the conspirators, or by checks sent to the conspirators. The loss to the eight victims who testified at trial was well over $1 million and the overall total loss was substantially higher.

In addition, the evidence at trial showed that the conspirators engaged in other types of fraud, including a fraudulent employment scam in which the victim was led to believe she had been hired by a company, and was instructed to deposit the proceeds of a fraudulent check into a drop account controlled by the conspirators.

According to the evidence, Ojedokun, Ogundele, Haruna, and their co-conspirators laundered money received from the fraud victims by buying used cars and shipping them to Nigeria, among other methods. As part of the fraud schemes, Ojedokun and his co-conspirators transmitted and used images of financial transactions, including bank deposit receipts and wire transfer forms, as proof that a deposit of fraud money had been made by a victim.

Ogundele, age 61, formerly of Laurel, Maryland, was convicted in 2016 after a 17-day trial, of conspiracies to commit money laundering and wire fraud, as well as aggravated identity theft, and was sentenced to 234 months in federal prison. Haruna, age 46, of Nigeria, remains a fugitive and charges against him are still pending. In addition to Ogundele, eight other defendants were convicted for their roles in the fraud scheme and were sentenced to between a year and a day and 234 months in federal prison.

Ojedokun faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. U.S. District Judge Paul W. Grimm has scheduled sentencing for January 20, 2021 at 10:00 a.m.

United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FBI for its work in the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Windom and U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur represented the United States at trial.

489,"The Indian businessman Vijay Mallya is understood to have applied for asylum in the UK in order to avoid extradition to India to face allegations of a £1bn fraud at his defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

The UK government ordered the multimillionaires extradition in February 2019 saying he was accused in India of conspiracy to defraud, making false representations and money-laundering offences. But Mallya, who lives in an £11.5m mansion in the Hertfordshire village of Tewin, delayed the process via appeals.

The high court in April rejected Mallyas appeal, ruling that there was a  prima facie case of fraud by false representation, setting Mallya on the path for extradition within 28 days.

However, Mallya is understood to have sought asylum in the UK under article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Mallyas lawyer, Anand Doobay of law firm Boutique Law, said they are not commenting on this case. Clare Montgomery QC, who represented Mallya in his failed appeal against extradition, also declined to comment.

A Home Office spokesperson said: The extradition of Vijay Mallya was ordered on 3 February 2019. As this an ongoing legal case it would not be appropriate to comment further.

News of Mallyas application for asylum was first reported by Indias CNBC -TV18.

Mallya, the self-proclaimed king of the good times, is alleged to have knowingly misled largely Indian state-owned banks about the fortunes of his failing Kingfisher Airlines, before laundering the cash to fund the defunct Force India Formula One team and other projects.

He has previously dismissed the allegations that he fled India leaving a trail of £977m worth of debts as ludicrous and said the charges were politically motivated.

In April he tweeted saying he has repeatedly offered 100% payback but sadly to no avail.

A judge ruled in December 2018 that Mallya had misrepresented how loans from Indian banks had been used and the decision on his extradition was approved by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid.

The senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot described Mallya as a glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy who charmed and cajoled these bankers into losing their common sense and persuading them to put their own rules and regulations to one side.

Indias prime minister, Narendra Modi, has singled out Mallya for criticism, accusing him of ripping off India and Indians.

There is no place for corruption in India, Modi said in previous comments referring to Mallya. Those who looted the poor and middle classes will have to return what they have looted.",am
490,"A Delhi court on Friday took cognizance of the supplementary chargesheet filed against alleged middleman Christian Michel, businessman Rajeev Saxena and others in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam case.

Special Judge Arvind Kumar, after taking cognizance of the supplementary chargesheet, issued summons to then AgustaWestland International Director G Saponaro, Rajeev Saxena, Sandeep Tyagi, a relative of the then Indian Air Force (IAF) chief SP Tyagi, and other accused and listed the matter for further hearing on October 23.

The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi had on Monday reserved its order in the matter after special public prosecutor DP Singh, representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), wrapped up his submission in the matter.

During the hearing, Singh told the court that there is enough material to proceed against the accused chargesheeted in the matter. The supplementary chargesheet was filed on Saturday before Special Judge Arvind Kumar.

According to sources, former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, who later became Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), has not been named as an accused in the chargesheet as CBI has not received sanction to prosecute Sharma till date. Sources said a fresh chargesheet will be filed after CBI received sanction to prosecute him.

Michel, the alleged middleman and accused in the Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland VVIP choppers deal case, was extradited from the UAE in December 2018. He is currently lodged in Tihar Jail in connection with alleged irregularities in the multi-crore chopper deal.

While the CBI is probing his alleged role as a 'middleman' in the deal, the ED is investigating money laundering charges against him.

Rajeev Saxena, a Dubai-based businessman, was also extradited from the UAE in January last year.

The AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal was finalized during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime under the leadership of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but got mired in the allegations of kickbacks.

491,"INGs subsidiary Payvision has been hit with accusations of supporting fraud and massive money laundering by the European Funds Recovery Initiative (EFRI).

In a detailed story EFRI comments: In our opinion Payvision is Netherlands Wirecard  a company helping scammers in big style fraud.

Fintech Direct contacted Payvision and EFRI on 4 November for the paytechs response and to look at the evidence, which EFRI was offering to the press. Neither replied.

Payvision enables online shops to accept credit card payments and acts as acquiring partner for merchants. ING acquired 75% of the shares in the paytech in spring 2018 at a valuation of 360 million.

EFRI explains that in January 2019 the Austrian and German law enforcement agencies arrested Uwe Lenhoff and charged him with fraud for being the beneficial owner of the boiler room scams Option888, ZoomTraderGlobal, Tradovest and Lottopalace, which ripped off thousands of unsuspecting European consumers. In July 2020, Lenhoff was found dead in his cell in Saarbrücken, Germany.

Gal Barak was arrested in Sofia, Bulgaria  where he operated boiler rooms and the investment scams xtraderFx and OptionStarsGlobal. He was found guilty in September this year for fraud and money laundering and sentenced to four years in jail in Vienna.

Based on the statements of these two accused and Rudolf Booker (Payvisions former CEO), EFRI says it is proven that the stolen money from the [various] boiler room scams were processed via Payvision from 2015?.

In December 2018 Payvision terminated the contracts due to negative public reporting about the fraudulent systems on the Fintelegram website.

According to EFRI, the companies attributed to Lenhoff and the platforms generated a total turnover (stolen money) of 55.6 million. The companies and platforms attributed to Barak show a total turnover of 75.6 million with Payvision.

EFRI notes: There had already been warnings published by various financial market supervisory authorities against the fraud schemes from Uwe Lenhoff and Gal Barak from 2016 onwards, but Payvision ignored all of them.

In September 2019 ING bought the remaining 25% share in Payvision. EFRI has something to say about that as it reckons ING must have known already about the kind of business Pavision was in, so they rewarded Booker and his partners with even more money.

EFRI adds: At the same time hundreds and thousands of unsuspecting European consumers have suffered from having been ripped off and having lost their life-time savings to scammers with the support of Payvision.

In terms of action, EFRI filed a money laundering complaint against Payvision in summer 2019 (except for a receipt confirmation, no response has been received from the relevant authorities).

It is about to send an updated version to the Dutch central bank. EFRI says it is also preparing legal steps against Payvision.

There will probably be more updates as this story develops.

Ilmars Rim?vi?s, who has led Latvia's central bank for 16 years and sits on the governing council of the ECB, was detained on Saturday. The country's anti-corruption agency said Monday that he was suspected of demanding a bribe of over 100,000 ($124,000).

A lawyer for Rim?vi?s told a local TV station over the weekend that his client believed the detention to be unlawful.

Latvian anti-corruption officials said Monday their case is not related to recent U.S. allegations of fraud at Latvia's third largest bank.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury last week proposed sanctions against Latvia's ABLV Bank, accusing it of having ""institutionalized money laundering as a pillar"" of its business.

ABLV falls under the supervision of the ECB, which effectively shuttered the bank on Monday by suspending its payments and halting withdrawals. The ECB said there had been a sharp deterioration in the lender's financial position.

The Treasury said that ABLV had conducted transactions related to North Korea's procurement or export of ballistic missiles, as well as ""large-scale illicit activity"" connected to Azerbaijan, Russia and Ukraine.

Russia borders Latvia to the east. The Baltic state of two million people is home to about 500,000 ethnic Russians.

""ABLV has facilitated transactions for corrupt politically exposed persons and has funneled billions of dollars in public corruption and asset stripping proceeds through shell company accounts,"" Treasury official Sigal Mandelker said in a statement on Feb. 13.

ABLV said in a statement on Feb. 14 that the Treasury allegations were based on ""assumptions."" The bank said its employees have never engaged in ""any act of bribery regarding any official.""

The ECB, where Rim?vi?s has served on the rate-setting committee since Latvia adopted the euro at its currency in 2014, declined to comment on his status.

Prime Minister M?ris Ku?inskis said there were ""no signs of a threat"" to the country's financial system and Latvia's central bank said it would resume normal activities on Monday.

""All usual services will be provided to businesses and the general public and also to the Latvian economy in general,"" it said in a statement.

ABLV said the ECB's decision would give it time to stabilize its situation.

""The structure of the bank's assets is balanced, yet given the unfolding events currently transfer and sale of assets may require longer time than it is in standard situations,"" ABLV said in a statement.

493,"(CBS/AP) AUSTIN, Texas - A lawyer for Jose Tevino Morales, the brother of two Mexican cartel leaders convicted of running a money laundering operation from a horse ranch in Oklahoma, described Morales as ""humble, honest, trustworthy, [and] caring,"" but a federal judge in Texas still sentenced him to 20 years in prison Thursday, the Austin American-Statesman reports.

Morales was sentenced for investing $16 million of drug money in the buying, training and racing of horses across the Southwest. His brothers, Miguel Angel and Oscar Omar Trevino Morales, are believed to lead the Zetas cartel, which has expanded beyond the drug trade to become the biggest criminal group in Mexico.

On Thursday, Trevino's lawyer told the court that the state was treating him unfairly because of who his brothers are. But U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks told Trevino, ""No one in this court has alleged you are a Zeta. You are charged with moving money for the Zetas,"" the paper reports.

Mexican authorities arrested Miguel Angel Trevino Morales in July. A New York indictment against him estimates he received $10 million per month in income from cocaine sales alone, not to mention the money brought in by the cartel's myriad illicit activities, including kidnapping, extortion, migrant trafficking, weapons trafficking, even theft of oil from state pipelines.

During the trial earlier this year, prosecutors said the money laundering operation in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico created fake companies and in some cases fixed races. Horse owners, trainers and others crafted bank deposits to mask the drug money being used to fund the operation.

Jose Trevino Morales was among 18 people indicted last year in a federal investigation that charged him with running the horse operation from a sprawling ranch near Lexington, Okla., on behalf of his brothers. Neighbors said those who worked with the ranch spent lots of cash, bought land and made improvements at a time when others in the industry were struggling financially.

More than 400 of the horses involved were seized and auctioned, and proceeds from the sales have netted the government $9 million, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks also was expected to sentence Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, Fernando Solis Garcia, Eusevio Maldonado and Raul Ramirez, who pleaded guilty in April to a lesser money laundering charge. Trevino's wife and daughter have pleaded guilty to lesser charges but have not been sentenced.

494,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlins ambition of turning Gazprom, the worlds biggest gas company, into a global energy titan is undermined by Soviet-style thinking, poor management and corruption, according to leaked U.S. diplomatic cables.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his protege, former Gazprom board chairman Dmitry Medvedev who is now Russias president, have tried to use Gazprom to claw back some of the international clout which Moscow lost after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

But leaked diplomatic cables from U.S. Ambassador to Moscow John Beyrle paint Russias biggest company as a confused and corrupt behemoth still behaving like its predecessor, the Soviet Ministry of Gas.

""Gazprom is what one would expect of a state-owned monopoly sitting atop huge wealth -- inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt,"" Beyrle wrote in a 2009 cable published by German magazine Der Spiegel on its www.spiegel.de website.

Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov declined immediate comment on the documents, part of the 251,287 U.S. embassy cables released to news organizations by WikiLeaks.

The leaked cables cast Putin as Russias alpha-dog leader who allows a venal elite of corrupt officials to siphon off cash from energy sales, comments Russias leadership have dismissed.

Moscow-based Gazprom supplies a quarter of the European Unions gas and has plans to increase its share of the European and Asian gas markets with vast pipeline projects that require tens of billions of dollars in investment.

During his presidency, Putin -- helped by a then relatively unknown Kremlin official, Dmitry Medvedev -- moved to reassert state control of Gazprom, appointing ally Alexei Miller as CEO.

The state-controlled company became an emblem of a resurgent Russia, snapping up assets at home and abroad, borrowing heavily and disrupting gas supplies to Europe in winter rows with former Soviet republics such as Ukraine.

But the economic crisis battered Gazprom and its market capitalization is now just over $150 billion, less than half its peak of more than $350 billion reached in 2008.

GAZPROM STRATEGY?

The U.S. cables repeat the view of many Western and Russian analysts that Gazproms management misjudged the future by betting that soaring European demand would continue to support a sellers market.

Instead Gazprom has faced demand destruction in Europe since 2009 as the global economic crisis forced European customers to slash consumption. They also often switched to liquefied gas from the Middle East, whose producers turned out to be much more flexible in their pricing policies than Gazprom.

Gazprom was simply unprepared for the inevitable leveling off and current decline in European gas demand, the U.S. ambassador said in the cables, adding that Gazprom misjudged the impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to Europe.

Gazprom will have to cope with massive new volumes of LNG on the global market from projects already underway in Qatar and elsewhere, he wrote.

Gazprom has repeatedly said it was keen to expand on U.S. gas markets but had to scale back its ambitions to supply liquefied gas (LNG) across the Atlantic as the United States boosted its own shale gas output and cut imports of LNG.

Gazprom is still clearly viewed as an instrument of Kremlin social policy, according to Beyrle, who cited a Gazprom executive as saying that the companys first two priorities were to provide reliable and affordable gas to the domestic population and to fulfill its social obligations.

A Gazprom that behaved more like a competitive global company would probably find a new path to growth more quickly, Beyrle wrote.

But Gazprom is not a competitive global company, despite sitting on the worlds largest gas reserves. Gazprom is a legacy of the old Soviet Ministry of Gas and it still operates much the same way, he wrote.",nam
495,"The Satyam scandal has shocked India.

It is being called India's Enron.

Many in the financial circles are dismayed that the biggest-ever corporate fraud in the country could have escaped unnoticed for so many years.

It has brought into question the levels of corporate governance in the country, and has cast an ugly shadow on the once shining image of Indian industry overseas.

Investors stunned

For the last couple of days outside the Bombay Stock Exchange, all anyone can talk about at the chai stalls and sandwich stores is how Ramalinga Raju, the former boss of Satyam Computers, managed to rack up a billion-dollar fraud right under their noses.

Investors in Indian shares were stunned by Mr Raju's revelation, in a letter to the stock exchange this Wednesday, when he confessed his wrongdoing and admitted that he had effectively cooked the books of his firm for the last several years.

Satyam's shares plummeted on the news by 75%, dragging down India's stock main market by 7%.

""I can't believe it,"" says investor Rajiv Gupta outside the stock market.

""It's very worrying, and it's happened at the worst possible time. Markets here were just started to look like they were recovering. But this news - it is very very bad.""

Ashok Bakliwal, another investor, agrees:

""This will put the spotlight on Indian companies, and overseas investors will be wary of putting their money here without taking a good, hard look at the company's books.""

""As if India wasn't going through enough of a bad time - now this? I really don't know what will happen next. How could a fraud of this magnitude take place and go unnoticed? ""

What went wrong?

It's a question that everyone is asking.

The controversy has got many in corporate circles here wondering whether it was India's new found love affair with capitalism that led to Satyam's downfall.

In the letter to his shareholders, Mr Raju says that he was trying to cover up the losses at Satyam, and in doing so got caught up in a vicious cycle of lies and debts.

He says this attempt to hide the losses from investors and shareholders was like ""riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten"".

According to Mr Raju's statement, about $1bn (£0.65bn), or 94% of the cash on the company's books, was made up - and analysts say it was the manipulation of the cash flow which could have been one reason why the deceit was undetected.

Many analysts also say that the chase for huge profits, and the desire to keep up with the break-neck speed of India's $50bn outsourcing industry's growth rates that may have been behind Mr Raju's motivation in fudging the accounts at his firm.

Disappeared

But trying to get any answers from Mr Raju since his confession letter is proving to be impossible - he has disappeared.

A company spokesperson has been quoted as saying that his whereabouts remain unclear for now.

At a company press conference on Thursday, the acting chief executive Ram Mynampati told journalists that he and other board members had no knowledge of the financial fraud and were hoping to get back to business as soon as possible.

""Our only aim at this time is to ensure that the business continues,"" Mr Mynampati says.

But it will be some time before it is business as usual for the troubled tech firm.

Indian media is reporting that financial regulators have despatched investigators to Hyderabad to launch a formal investigation into the case.

India's main stock exchanges have announced they are removing Satyam Computers from their indices as of January 12 because of the stunning revelations

Leading members of Indian industry have also expressed their shock and disappointment that such an audacious act of deception could take place.

Chanda Kochar, the joint managing director of ICICI Bank, one of India's biggest lenders, says she is shocked by the news.

""It's a wake-up call - but I would like to say that it's important to remember this is an isolated event and shouldn't be seen as a barometer for the general level of corporate governance in India,"" she says.

""But it is also important for us to monitor the auditors and the other players in this scandal, and for us to become a lot more careful.""

Investor flight?

But caution alone may not be enough to convince international investors that Indian companies are serious about cleaning up their governance

Many of Satyam's customers were persuaded to get into business with the company because of Mr Raju's suave, professional image.

The Western educated MBA graduate was one of the poster boys of India's new economy.

The fine is one of the largest handed out by the regulator in relation to money-laundering failures. Standard Chartered was fined £102m by the FCA in April 2019 for similar issues, although that was dwarfed by the $1.1bn penalty levied on the same bank by US authorities.

Commerzbank London qualified for a 30% discount on the fine because it agreed to cooperate. The full fine would have been £54m.

Due diligence checks on more than 1,700 clients of Commerzbanks London office were overdue by 2017, when the regulator took action.

Some of these customers were able to carry on transactions with the bank despite the checks not having been completed because of an out-of-control system of exceptions, the FCA said.

The bank also failed to fix an automated tool for monitoring money-laundering risks. The FCA said Commerzbank London in 2015 found that 40 high-risk countries were missing from the tool, and 1,110 high-risk clients had not been added.

Commerzbanks policies and procedures for customer due diligence were found to be inadequate.

Mark Steward, the FCAs executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: Commerzbank Londons failings over several years created a significant risk that financial and other crime might be undetected. Firms should recognise that [anti-money laundering] controls are vitally important to the integrity of the UK financial system.

The bank has been forced to carry out a significant remediation exercise to put the processes in place, as well as appointing a senior executive to test it.

The fine will add to financial pressure on Commerzbank, which hopes to cut costs after sustaining a 227m (£203m) loss before tax in the first three months of 2020.

A spokeswoman for the bank said the FCA had found no financial crime during its investigations. Commerzbank has cooperated fully with the Financial Conduct Authority to mitigate any potential compliance risks promptly and appropriately, she said.

The FCA investigation relates to the time period of October 2012 to September 2017. The bank has successfully remediated and addressed the deficiencies that were the subject of the investigation.",am
497,"What is Vijay Mallyas Scam? Vijay Mallya Case Study

Have you heard about Kingfisher? Yes, you may have heard the name of the kingfisher because it is the most prominent brand in beer.

Kingfisher Owns by United Spirits. Vijay Mallya is the chairman of United Spirits.

Mallya owes a Rs 9,000 crore from 17 Indian banks and is accused of fraud and money laundering cases in the country.

In this blog, we will discuss what is the Vijay Mallyas scam. We will also read the failure reason of Kingfisher airline which is owned by Vijay Mallya. So lets start the Vijay Mallya Case Study

Whats in it for me

1. Kingfisher Company Overview

Kingfisher is an Indian brand owned by United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) or UB Group Bangalore based Indian Company. UB group has several businesses but its core business is beer, aviation, and investment.

UB Group markets its beer product under the brand name of kingfisher, UB groups also owns several brands of beers. Kingfisher was launched in 1978 and now it is the largest beer producer of India with market shares.

Kingfisher beer is also sold in many other countries. UB group also launched Kingfisher airlines in India. Till December 2011 Kingfisher Airlines had the second largest market share in Indias domestic air travel. The company closed its operations in India after its inspections.

2. Who is Vijay Mallya?

Vijay Mallya is an Indian businessman and former member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). Vijay Mallya also owns Royal Challenger Banglore  IPL Team. Vijay Mallya became the chairman of United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) in 1983 at the age of 28 after his fathers death. Vijay Mallya grew its company rapidly.

From 1998 to 1999, Vijay Mallya grew the turnover of the company by 64%. He also Diversified the business of the company by acquiring many other companies. He acquired Berger Paints which is an Indian Paint company.

Vijay Mallya was also elected as a member of parliament twice from Karnataka. The company also achieved the milestone of selling 10 crores cases in India and by this achievement, the company became the second-largest spirits company in India.

All this achievement was possible by the control of Vijay Mallyas Chairmanship. Kingfisher Airlines was launched by Vijay Mallya in 2015.

3. What is Vijay Mallyas Scam

Vijay Mallya wants to expand his liquor and Airline business. His advisors advise him not to do this but despite his advisors advice, he does the same. He sold another company formed by his father to fund its airline company.

Vijay Mallyas kingfisher becomes Indias no.1 domestic airline company and first choice of every passenger. Due to some restrictions, the Indian Government did not allow kingfishers to fly international flights. To fly international flights he leveraged United Spirits or United Breweries to buy Deccan Air which is a loss-making company and merged it with Kingfisher Airlines but it could not make the profits thus in 2010 Malayas this business was in heavy loss.

To run this business he continuously took loans from banks. He took loans of 9000 crores by 17 banks. Although SBI has declared them as bankrupt other banks kept lending him loans because he was a member of Rajya Sabha and some parties supported him. His company kingfisher also -held service tax of passengers, PF, Income Tax of Employees, but did not submit to the PF or IT authorities.

The company also did not pay the salary of its employees or ran out of cash. In 2012 the company had to shut down its operation. Vijay Mallya had a loan of 9000 from different banks and he denied to pay this loan.

The Company United Breweries forced Vijay Mallya to resign the post of chairman of united spirits and paid him $75M for a severance payment, but Indian courts blocked this payment.

SBI and other banks filed a case against Vijay Mallya but before taking any action against Vijay Mallya he flew away to the United Kingdom. There is also a side story of Vijay Mallya that he offers banks to pay 4000 crores for settlement but banks refused their proposal. Banks demand at least 4900 crores which a principal amount furthermore banks are demanding interest as well.

4. Loans Taken by Vijay Mallya

Rs 1,600 crore SBI
Rs 800 crore PNB
Rs 800 crore IDBI
Rs 650 crore Bank of India
Rs 550 crore Bank of Baroda
Rs 430 crore United Bank of India
Rs 410 crore Central Bank of India
Rs 320 crore UCO Bank

Rs 150 crore State Bank of Mysore

5. Failure Reason of Kingfisher Airlines

1. Lack of Business Strategy

The first reason for the failure of Kingfisher airlines is the lack of strategy. First, the company launched an economic class service later they shifted to luxury class After that they shifted as a low-cost airline.

As the company continuously changes its targeted audience, passengers lose interest in this airline. The other issue in their business strategy is that they do not focus on Profitable routes.

2. Lack of Management

The other failure of Kingfisher airlines is that Vijay Mallya involved too much in his airline business. Kingfisher doesnt have any long term CEO or MD. Management is an important part of any business whether its failure or success.

3. 2008 Recession

There are not all internal faults in the failure of Kingfisher airlines; there are some external factors too. The other reason for failure in Kingfisher airlines is the 2008 recession which plays an important role in the failure of Kingfisher airlines.

The recession impacted the whole world and also the aviation industry. Due to the recession, there is high inflation in fuel prices or airport charges. All of these factors impact the health of Kingfisher airlines.

As we have already discussed the acquisition of Air Deccan which is a low-cost airline company that was acquired by Kingfisher airline. In the Begging, Vijay Mallya treated both as separate companies.

There was a time when the flight of both companies flew at the same time but later they decided to cancel the flights of Air Deccan but the customers of Air Deccan did not transfer to Kingfisher Airline They transferred to their competitor.

5. High Operational cost

The other external reason for the failure of kingfisher airline is that there is a high operational cost in the airline industry as compared to other industries. Airline companies require licenses for came the next thing that is a merger with Air Deccan, which the routes, investment in the aircraft maintenance, salaries were a low-cost airline.

There is also a high price of fuel and the company did not able to recover its cost or continuously made loose. There is also great competition in the airline industry thats why this company offers low cost but they forget if they did not earn a good margin their company will be closed.

I hope you learn very important lessons from Vijay Mallya Case Study. Share this case study with your friends.

6. RCBs Connection With Vijay Mallya
RCB is an IPL franchises team that was founded by United Spirits in 2008. Royal Challenger Bangalore also promotes its brand Kingfisher till 2013 but in 2014 no liquor brand was promoted by RCB.

United Sprites Wholly owns the RCb thus Vijay Mallya Resigned from United Spritss chairman he also resigned from RCs Director Position. After Vijay Mallya Financial scandals Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers and RCB changed the team logo. RCBs holding company Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL) is owned by United Spirits.

United Spirits now owned by the British beverage company Diageo, is the largest shareholder in RCSPL. Diageo Acquired United Sprits in 2014. Before Acquiring United Spirits Diageo has conducted an investigation in which they found financial irregularities of t Rs 1.15 billion (Rs 115 crore). USLs management revealed that Rs 1.15 billion had been potentially diverted from RCSPL. In 2019, the company earns more than 10% of its operating profits Through RCB While RCB performed Very Bad in the season.

498,"While Chinese companies are feeling the pressure of anti-graft and tax evasion crackdowns at home, some are also facing similar campaigns abroad as African countries try to stamp out corrupt practices.

In the past three years, a number of Chinese-owned companies have landed in trouble with investigating agencies for tax evasion.

Others have been accused of bribing their way to winning lucrative infrastructure contracts, on a continent that has some of the worlds most corrupt countries, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index 2018, compiled by Transparency International, an international non-governmental organisation.

In Kenyas crackdown on corruption under President Uhuru Kenyatta, Chinese-owned companies are among about 600 being investigated over alleged tax evasion and bribery.

There is a similar story in neighbouring Uganda, whose tax agency last year released a list of suspected cases that linked several Chinese firms to fraudulent tax activities. Of 148 firms on the list, 93 were foreign-owned, of which at least 90 had Chinese directors. The firms were accused of using fictitious invoices to indicate business transactions when there was no genuine supply or movement of goods.

Asked about the cases involving Chinese companies, the Chinese embassy in Nairobi told the South China Morning Post it supports the Kenyan governments legitimate actions on tax regulation.

As always, the Chinese government requests Chinese companies in Kenya abide by Kenyan laws, to pay taxes legally and fulfil social responsibilities, spokeswoman Huang Xueqing said.

In mid-October, the Kenyan tax agency arrested and bailed three directors of Tianyi, a Chinese real estate company, for allegedly failing to declare and pay taxes totalling US$260,000 from the sale of 171 houses.

In another case, Gao Fei, director of New X-Tigi Technology, a Chinese mobile phone maker, was charged in Nairobi with allegedly evading US$1.94 million in value-added tax.

Other companies in the tax authorities cross hairs include ZTE Kenya, a subsidiary of the giant Chinese technology company ZTE, over accusations of unpaid tax, and Electric Tools Kenya, whose three Chinese directors were charged with allegedly failing to pay US$580,000 in tax.

For their part, Chinese investors in Africa complain that they are forced to bribe to do business there. A 2017 McKinsey report said that in five of the eight countries studied, corruption was Chinese investors top concern. In each of those countries, between 60 and 87 per cent of Chinese firms said they had paid tips or bribes to obtain a business licence.

According to the McKinsey report, some members of Chinese communities in Africa have formed a strong perception that in these countries, tips if not bribes are necessary to get anything done.

One experienced Chinese businessman told the researchers: There are so many random government authorities that come to my business for inspections, and I have to give them penalties or tips almost every time, just to get on with my work.

On the African side, McKinsey found, there was a perception that Chinese businesses were easier targets for tips and bribes than other foreign firms. An official in charge of major government tenders told McKinsey researchers that its a lot easier to get them to pay.

In September, Kenyas Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission arrested directors of Erdemann Property, a major Chinese real estate firm, for allegedly colluding with directors of the Lake Basin Development Authority to inflate by US$25 million the cost of building a shopping centre in Kisumu, a city in the countrys west.

Investigators also alleged that Erdemanns directors bribed the development authoritys chairman to the tune of US$170,000 and other benefits including flats and shops, and that the head of the finance committee received US$120,000.",am
499,"By Domani Spero

We blogged previously about the challenge of holding the killers of USAID Officer John Granville and FSN Abdel Rahman Abbas accountable in the Sudanese judicial system. After their 2010 escape from Khartoums max security prison, one is reportedly dead, one is back in jail and two remains at large three years after their escape. These two have a $5 million bounty on each head. The State Department has now designated the third and last of the convicted murderers as a terrorist under E.O 13244. The individual is back jail, so not sure why this designation is happening now. Unless this is in preparation for when Hamza gets to escape again.

$10 Million Bounty for Sudanese Killers of USAID Employees Killed in 2008
How much does a US diplomats life worth? About $1,800 US dollars, and look theres no raging mob
Convicted Killer of USAID Employees in Sudan, and 2010 Escapee Reportedly Killed in Somalia

The U.S. Department of State has designated Abd Al-RaOuf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza under Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism. As a result of this designation, all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hamza has any interest is blocked and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with him.

Hamza, with three co-conspirators, participated in an armed attack in Khartoum, Sudan on January 1, 2008, which resulted in the deaths of a U.S. diplomat serving with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), John Michael Granville, and a locally employed U.S. Embassy staff member, Adbelrahman Abbas Rahama. The attack occurred when Granville and Abbas were leaving a New Years Eve party in Khartoum. Granville worked on democracy and governance programs for USAID.

The four men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Sudanese criminal court in 2009. In 2010, the four men escaped from a maximum security prison, killing a Sudanese police officer and wounding another in the process. Shortly thereafter, Hamza was recaptured and is currently in prison in Khartoum. Another escapee was reportedly killed in Somalia in 2011, and the other two remain fugitives at large. These two fugitives, Abdelbasit Alhaj Alhasan Haj Hamad and Mohamed Makawi Ibrahim Mohamed, were designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists under E.O. 13224 on January 8, 2013 and remain at large. The U.S. Department of States Rewards for Justice program has authorized rewards of up to $5 million each for information leading to the capture of the two fugitives.

In making this designation, the Department seeks to emphasize to the public and, in particular, to the Granville and Abbas families, our commitment to justice prevailing in this case.

A former financial adviser who conned his clients out of nearly £750,000 has been jailed for more than 10 years.

Peter Dilenardo, 50, showed a ""complete disregard"" for his victims, West Yorkshire Police said.

Dilenardo, of Burley-in-Wharfedale, near Ilkley, was convicted of eight fraud offences after a trial.

At Leeds Crown Court earlier he was jailed for a total of 10 years and three months, and banned from being a company director for nine years.

Police said he had worked as an independent financial adviser who was authorised to give investment advice about products regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

But when that authorisation ended in 2014, he continued to advise clients to take money out of regulated funds and invest them in his company - Orion Financial and Luna Property Management, based in Otley.

He conned his victims from around the UK out of a combined £747,000, according to the force.

Dilenardo then sold his client portfolio despite a restraint order, and paid more than £100,000 worth of proceeds into UK and US accounts.

After a nine-week trial, he was found guilty of eight fraud offences including abuse of position and false representation, selling client bank accounts, forging signatures, carrying out a regulated activity unauthorised, and perverting the course of justice,

Ramona Senior, of West Yorkshire Police's Economic Crime Unit, said Dilenardo had shown a ""complete disregard for his victims and [their] financial hardship and stress"".",am

A former Hollywood movie executive is charged with embezzling millions of dollars in investor funds, the FBI alleged in a complaint that was unsealed Friday.

William Sadleir, 66, is the former chairman and CEO of Aviron Pictures, a production and distribution company that participated in seven movies between 2015 and 2019. Hes accused of engaging in two fraudulent schemes related to a $75 million investment that BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust made in Aviron.

LORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI PLEAD GUILTY TO COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CHARGE S

Sadleir opened a bank account for a fake company and transferred $25 million of BlackRocks investment that hed claimed would be used for advertising, Department of Justice authorities said. Instead, Sadleir used $14 million from the funds to buy a Beverly Hills home.

To help pull off the scheme, Sadleir went as far as creating a fake identity named ""Amanda Stevens"" to send emails claiming Aviron had purchased $27 million in advertising credits, officials said.

Sadleir also forged signatures on paperwork in order to remove a lien BlackRock had on assets that hed previously agreed to in order to secure the firms investment, according to the complaint.

Hes charged with two counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. In a separate case, the Securities and Exchange Commission also accuses Sadleir of violating antifraud provisions of securities laws.

We allege that Sadleir raided millions from BIT and its investors, and rather than using those funds for investment purposes he spent them lavishly on himself, Adam Aderton, co-chief of the SECs Enforcement Division Asset Management Unit, said in a statement.

Aviron has had a tough time in the movie business. Its most successful title, Kidnap starring Halle Berry, cost $21 million and took in $34 million worldwide. Other titles like 2019s Serenity netted just $40 million at the box office on a $49 million budget, and 2018s A Private War lost money compared to production costs  costing $18 million to make but earning just $3.9 million.

If convicted, each count of wire fraud could carry as long as 20 years in prison, and the identity theft charge comes with a mandatory two-year sentence.

The SEC's complaint seeks to recover funds from Sadleir.

A spokesperson for BlackRock told FOX Business that BlackRock is pleased that the government has moved swiftly to investigate and bring Mr. Sadleir to justice.",am
502,"With the ninth anniversary of his flight from the authorities in his homeland of Kazakhstan fast approaching, the raft of transnational court cases involving fugitive embezzler Mukhtar Ablyazov show no sign of abating. In a saga which stretches from an institutional aversion to tackling kleptocracy in the United Kingdom, to U.S President Donald Trumps shady business partners, the murky world of Mukhtar Ablyazov even led his family to make a pit stop in the Central African Republic to pick-up diplomatic passports. Yet despite having judgements against him totaling $4.9 billion in the British courts alone, almost six years since he fled from the UK to avoid three concurrent 22-month sentences for contempt of court, Ablyazov remains a free man, living the high life in France whilst bemoaning his plight to be a simple case of political persecution.

The venues for the latest rounds of litigation against Ablyazov include proceedings in London, Lyon, Astana, Los Angeles and New York. In the UK, a case brought by JSC BTA Bank accuses Ablyazovs son-in-law, Ilyas Khrapunov of orchestrating a conspiracy in breach of court orders to prevent the enforcement of freezing orders against Ablyazov. In France, the fallout from the hacking of a magistrates phone and a decision taken by Frances highest administrative court, the Conseil dEtat in December 2016, to overturn an extradition order against Ablyazov continues to rumble on. In New York, the Khrapunovs stand accused of laundering money by flipping Trump Soho condos, a subject likely to come up in the Mueller probe. In Kazakhstan, meanwhile, where Ablyazov was recently sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison for embezzlement and abuse of authority, in October 2017 the Prosecutor Generals office reopened a case which implicates Ablyazov in the murder of a wealthy opponent.

So who is this criminal mastermind, a man alleged to have ordered the assassination of his erstwhile business partner and found guilty of committing  fraud on an epic scale ?

A Country Boy Turned Kleptocrat

Born in 1963 in Southern Kazakhstan to a family of limited means, Mukhtar Ablyazov graduated from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute during perestroika, a time when the achievements of the Soviet Union were being radically reassessed. With the winds of change that would result in the rise of the oligarchs raking across the USSR, Ablyazov abandoned a career in nuclear physics to embrace the new Wild West capitalism. Only weeks after legislation allowing private enterprises in Kazakhstan was passed, Ablyazov registered a company selling fax machines, photocopiers and computers in December 1992. Launching a plethora of businesses in quick succession, he set about luring elites into investing in his Astana Holding Bank, one of the first institutions in the country to gain a private banking license. In 1998, together with a consortium of investors, Ablyazov acquired a loan to buy Bank Turan Alem  later to become known as BTA Bank  in a privatization auction for a cut-price fee of $72 million.

At around the same time, Ablyazov was appointed as head of the state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company (KEGOC) and named Minister for Energy, Industry, and Trade in Kazakhstan. Within a year, KECOG revenues were down by 12 percent and expenditure up by 53 percent, a pattern repeated in 1999 when he was named CEO of Air Kazakhstan, swiftly asset-stripping the company into bankruptcy. Having had the temerity to form a party of opposition to President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in 2002 Ablyazov was sentenced to jail, purportedly for abuse of government office, re-emerging a year later having sworn to abstain from political adventures.

Having retained his interests in BTA through a beneficial ownership arrangement, in 2005 Ablyazov became chairman of the bank following the death of his predecessor, Yerzhan Tatishev in what was ruled at the time to have been a freak hunting accident. Recanting his original statement, in November 2017, Muratkhan Tokhmadiyev, the man who admitted at the time to shooting Ablyazovs erstwhile business partner told a court in Almaty: Each time I met [Ablyazov] he argued that Yerzhan could not at any instant keep or sustain his word He proposed to deal with the problem through the physical elimination of Yerzhan. This would happen during a hunting trip and look like an accidental death. And so it happened.

As Chairman of BTA, Ablyazov was now free to start funneling money out of what was the largest retail bank in Kazakhstan. This was largely done by issuing loans to finance real estate deals throughout the former Soviet Union, loans which were passed through a web of shell companies. Operating as a bank within a bank from a separate high security section of BTAs head office, between 2005 and 2009 at least $8 billion worth of loans were approved, largely to mailbox entities with no collateral, based in tax havens in which Ablyazov held a significant but almost exclusively anonymous ownership interest. Following the financial crash and Ablyazovs flight from his homeland to claim asylum in the UK, an audit by the Kazakh authorities discovered this huge black hole. In total, over a thousand companies worldwide in which Mukhtar Ablyazov held a beneficial interest have been identified so far, ranging from an oceanarium to the fancifully named Facebook Trading Limited.

A Shell Within a Shell

To obfuscate the whereabouts of assets, many of these offshore entities worked on a lend and borrow basis, shuffling capital on to a third party from where it could no longer be recovered. An example of this would be the $118 million of BTA collateral channeled through a company called Starwood Contracts Limited in the Seychelles, whose beneficial owner was Somerset Projects IHC, based in the British Virgin Islands, which held its bank accounts in Latvia. Starwood then received 99 percent of the shares in Archeston Solutions Inc, based in the British Virgin Islands, which in turn controlled 99 percent of a concern called Business Engineering in Moscow, which owned another enterprise called Central Engineering in Moscow. Starwood and Somerset then loaned Jollawood Trading in Cyprus $25 million, who then credited the funds to Central Engineering.

If that sounds impenetrable, its because its supposed to be.

In a more straightforward example, $1 billion was transferred from BTA to a trio of companies in the guise of loans for new drilling equipment with which to explore the Mertviy Kultuk oilfield in the Caspian Sea. With the type of rig specified in the loan agreement not having been invented, the oilfield remains untapped to this day.

In September 2005, Eastbridge Capital, an investment holding company nominally owned by Alexander Udovenko was formed in London. When Hogan Lovells, a law firm representing BTA, asked to see Eastbridges computer records, they were told that the company  the hub through which Ablyazov shifted his assets around the world  had been sold for a pound and its records lost forever. Yet when investigators followed Ablyazovs brother-in-law, Salim Shalabayev, to a storage unit in north London in January 2011, a search warrant enabled them to uncover a cache of 25 boxes of documentation and a hard drive detailing the exploits of many of Ablyazovs shell companies. Wanted in Russia for his part in a $730 million fraud, Udovenko had already long since disappeared. His whereabouts remain unknown to this day. Eastbridge Capital would later resurface in Cyprus under the name Euroguard Assets Limited.

Roman Borisovich from the anti-kleptocracy NGO, ClampK spoke to The Diplomat about Ablyazovs shell companies and the fact that among the purported beneficial owners of these were a dead alcoholic and a down-and-out former soldier who knew nothing of the concern in question. Clearly, he didnt set them all up, Borisovich says. This was his accountants and lawyers, and they would know where the key elements are. Sometimes these companies are created because you want them to be a chain of ownership, so five companies could be set up just for the purpose of one owning another. Thats how things work so theres virtually no way of linking an individual to a company. As for the [beneficial owners], its easily done. These documents  especially with homeless people  they sell, lose or people steal their passports and then, the next thing you know, they become owners. They open up all sorts of companies. This happens quite a lot.

Cynicism, Opportunism and Deviousness

Although Ablyazov was granted asylum in the UK, settling into opulent Carlton House on Billionaires Row in Highgate  one of four UK properties he was later found to be the owner of  his troubles followed him in the form of lawsuits brought against him by BTA Bank. It was his duplicitous dealings in British real estate, in fact, which led Ablyazov to perjure himself, Justice Nigel Teare finding that he had  acted in contempt of court  in attempting to conceal these assets.

Sentenced to 22 months in prison, Ablyazov was soon on the run again, this time from British justice. Despite an arrest warrant having been issued and his mugshot being placed on airport watch lists, he managed to slip away to France. Civil contempt is not an extraditable offence in the UK.

In his absence, between November 2012 and March 2013, British courts passed $4.2 billion in judgments against Ablyazov, with Lord Justice Maurice Kay observing that: It is difficult to imagine a party to commercial litigation who has acted with more cynicism, opportunism and deviousness towards court orders than Mr Ablyazov. Only a small fraction of the $4.9 billion in judgements passed against Ablyazov by the British courts have been physically recovered.

Among numerous British institutions to suffer at the hands of Ablyazov, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)  which was subsequently bailed-out by British taxpayers  suffered losses of more than $1.8 billion. Charles van der Leeuw, the author of a book on Ablyazov and the Kazakh kleptocrats, told The Diplomat, RBS inherited the foolish investment into BTA at the time Ablyazov was running it from its takeover of assets belonging to ABN AMRO.

These assets were, and still are, risk-bearing, he said, meaning that default can turn them into liabilities. No one can tell me that ABN AMRO was unaware of that when it acquired them. No one can tell me either that RBS was unaware of that when it took them over from ABN AMRO. It is hard to prove a kickback in the process, but given the ease with which RBS and other funders accepted their haircut, it definitely fails to pass the smell test. If BTA lays claims to funds disappeared through Ablyazovs network, it should endeavor to lay claims on RBS and others, holding them co-responsible for the thefts.

An area where assets were successfully recovered came in the form of Ablyazovs four properties in and around London. After years of court battles, the proceeds from the sale of these assets were the first funds that BTA was to see. With research released by Transparency International in March 2017 identifying 40,000 properties in London alone worth a total of almost $6 billion that were purchased by individuals with suspicious wealth, this success is rare in itself.

Our research suggests the UK is home to billions of pounds in corrupt assets, Duncan Hames, Director of Policy at Transparency International UK told The Diplomat. We acknowledge the challenges of prosecuting transnational corruption cases but expect the UK authorities to play a full part in investigating any aspect of global money laundering cases with a UK connection.

Naomi Hirst, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said Its been 18 months since the Panama Papers, and back then it looked as if the government did actually take notice and recognize the scale of the problem and the UKs role in that.

Subsequent to the Panama Papers, she said, the International Anti-Corruption Summit was hosted here by David Cameron At the summit, the government promised to bring in a register which would reveal the real owners of overseas companies that own properties here In the 18 months that have passed, were another set of leaks on, but really weve seen no meaningful action from the UK government.

Fugitive on the French Riviera

After hightailing it out of the UK, Ablyazov went into hiding, moving between luxury villas in the south of France. Shortly after this, in late 2012, the name Yelena Tyshchenko began appearing on legal documents pertaining to Ablyazovs case. A Ukrainian lawyer, Tyshchenko was spending an increasing amount of time at the headquarters of Eastbridge Capital in Tower 42 in Londons Old Broad Street. With Tyshchenko finalizing her separation from her husband at the time, the man named in his petition for divorce was none other than Mukhtar Ablyazov.

In mid-July 2013, following swiftly dismissed procedural motions brought by Ablyazov in the High Court in London, investigators hired by BTA trailed Tyshchenko to a villa in Nice, where she changed into a skimpy outfit before driving to a second property near Cannes. After 17 months of intense searching, Tyshchenko had led the gumshoes straight to Ablyazov  by this juncture the subject of an Interpol Red Notice  who was spotted through the curtains laying flowers on a bed in preparation for his mistresses arrival. For the next two weeks, investigators  one decked in a bikini and another repeatedly trudging back and forth over a crossing near the main villa  staked out Ablyazov. On July 31, French Special Forces stormed the premises. Ablyazov would spend the next three years in detention.

Arrested in a Moscow hotel a month later for swindling and money laundering, Tyshchenko went on to turn evidence against her former lover in exchange for amnesty from prosecution. Within a year, Tyshchenko had been appointed as head of a government anti-corruption task force in Ukraine, though she was soon fired for failing to disclose her real estate dealings in the UK and France.

For the next three years, for much of which he was incarcerated in Fleury-Mérogis prison, Ablyazov continued to protest his innocence. Everything is untrue. Everything has been fabricated in Kazakhstan, he told a court in Aix-en-Provence; Im convinced I am being persecuted for political reasons. Speaking on behalf of the French state, Advocate-General Solange Legras told the court that Ablyazov should be seen as a criminal on a grand scale When you have so much money, you can buy everything, but you cannot buy the French justice system.

In January 2014, the court approved an extradition request by Russia, where Ablyazov is wanted for fraud totalling $4.5 billion. This decision having been upheld by the courts of appeal, an extradition order was signed by then Prime Minister, Manuel Valls in 2015. On December 9, 2016, though, the Conseil dEtat overturned all previous verdicts on the grounds that the extradition request had been made for political reasons. France must refrain from extraditing an individual to a country where there are serious grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Nils Melzer had argued just days before the ruling.

In a written interview, a representative of BTA Bank described the courts decision as completely unexpected, expressing their surprise and disappointment. Although the logic behind this judicial reversal remains mystifying, an expert on the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity cited wider geopolitical concerns and a low point in Franco-Russian relations as the key factors behind the decision.

The Silk Road to Soho

It is through their nefarious real estate deals that Ablyazov and his associates have become embroiled in legal battles in the United States. During his time as chairman, BTA joined forces on investment projects with the Silk Road Group, a company implicated in alleged financial fraud as revealed in the Panama Papers. The Silk Road Group entered into an agreement with the Trump Organization to license the Trump brand for two luxury developments in Tbilisi and Batumi, Georgia, a deal which was only cancelled when Donald Trump became president. The relationship between the two parties may be subject to former Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) director Robert Muellers investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. With Trumps lawyer stating that the real-estate deal would be outside the scope of legitimate inquiry, Trump himself has been even more forthright.

Another subject under investigation is the Bayrock Group, which the Trump Organization partnered with for projects in Arizona, Florida and New York. Ablyazovs in-laws, former mayor of Almaty, Viktor Khrapunov, his TV anchorwoman wife, Leila and their son, Ilyas became involved with Bayrock during the companys development of the Trump Soho project in Manhattan. Court documents tie Trump associate Felix Sater  who served time for stabbing a man in bar brawl and Mafia-linked stock fraud  to the Khrapunovs, who flipped three condos in the development. The Khrapunovs are currently the subject of civil suits in New York and Los Angeles. In 2016, Nicolas Bourg, former director of Luxembourg based investment company, Triadou SPV S.A. testified that the business belonged to the Khrapunovs, who instructed him to siphon funds out of the United States after the lawsuit was filed. Bourg went on to attest that the Khrapunovs and Ablyazov commingled investments, using shell companies to obfuscate the nature of their real estate deals in the United States and beyond.

Back in 2005, Donald Trump granted Bayrock the exclusive rights to construct a Trump International Hotel and Tower in Moscow, a venture in which hed receive a significant stake. In direct contradiction to Trumps recent claims, emails uncovered by investigators show that Sater and Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen were actively pursuing a hotel deal in Moscow during the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, Trump has attempted to distance himself from any wrongdoing. If he were sitting in this room right now, I really wouldnt know what he looks like, Trump said of Sater in 2013, despite a plethora of photographs showing the pair together. Our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it, Sater enthused in emails to Michael Cohen. I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process. I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.

Playing at Politics

Almost inevitably, this tangled tale leads full circle back to London, where a suit seeking a freezing order on the assets of Ilyas Khrapunov for acting as a proxy for his father-in-law has been in motion since June 2017, though it is not set to go to trial until January 2019. That Khrapunov acted as a conscientious accomplice to Ablyazovs embezzlement schemes, there are, according to a representative of BTA Bank, no grounds for doubt the Commercial Court of England and Wales issued a decision obliging Ilyas Khrapunov to provide all data under a previously imposed disclosure order information about his assets and the assets that he manages on behalf of Mukhtar Ablyazov, but he refused to do so. Moreover, the court ordered Ilyas Khrapunov to pay the legal expenses incurred by the Bank. Currently challenging the jurisdiction of both British and American courts over him in an attempt to stymie the legal process, Ilyas Khrapunov is also the subject of an extradition request from Ukraine in Switzerland.

For Ablyazov, meanwhile, continuing to present himself as an opposition figure and the cases against him as politically motivated has played well. Ablyazov is neither the first nor the last in using the label of political victim, a representative of BTA Bank told The Diplomat. Posing as a political victim, he certainly hopes for protection from the law, primarily in Western jurisdictions. Ablyazov simply has no other choice but to stick to this single line of defense.

British Member of the European Parliament Julie Ward is among the signatories of a letter to Interpol calling cases against Ablyazov politically motivated. In a statement, a parliamentary assistant to the MEP said that Ablyazov refused to disclose his assets to the London court citing the risk of his associates persecution by the Nazarbayev regime. He was therefore charged with contempt of court and, as a result, he was sentenced to 22 months incarceration. After being warned of risks of kidnapping or assassination several times by various sources, including the British police, he was forced to leave the UK.

While putting a new spin on Ablyazovs claim that he was forced to use offshore secrecy, this argument belies both the case in point and the timeline of events. Firstly, the judgement of contempt of court related to lies told by Ablyazov in a sham designed to deceive the court into believing that he was not the sole beneficial owner of real estate in the UK, according to Justice Teare. Secondly, while it is true that Ablyazov did receive a so-called Osman warning from the Metropolitan Police notifying him of an assassination and kidnapping threat, this was served on January 29, 2011. Over a year would pass before he fled the country.

Today, from his villa in France, Ablyazov continues to bemoan his persecution through NGOs such as the Open Dialog Foundation, whose activities, a report from a conference held in the European Parliament in November 2017 found, are funded by companies flagged and sanctioned by the West. The real losers in this case, however, are those hardest hit by Ablyazovs activities: Kazakh pensioners who saw their retirement funds disappear and some 30,000 homebuyers in Almaty who invested in properties which were never built. In these opaque cases, BTA Bank says, $1.4 billion has been recovered to date. Current estimates as to the total amount embezzled by Mukhtar Ablyazov stand at in excess of $10 billion.",am
503,"(AP) MEXICO CITY - Mexican regulators have levied a $28 million fine against the Mexico subsidiary of London-based HSBC bank for failing to prevent money laundering through accounts at the bank.

Mexico's National Securities and Banking Commission said Wednesday that HSBC has paid the fines, equivalent to 379 million pesos, or about half of the subsidiary's 2011 annual profits.

The commission, and a report by a U.S. senate investigative committee, found the bank failed to control suspicious flows of billions of dollars through its accounts and didn't respond promptly after being warned about a huge swell in dollar cash transactions at the bank.

Guillermo Babatz, president of the banking commission, said that at its peak in the mid-2000s, HSBC had become the main shipper of dollar cash transfers from Mexico to the United States, accounting for about half of the total flow, even though it wasn't then among the country's largest banks.

Babatz said that regulators detected the swell of suspicious transactions and warned local management in 2007 and 2008, but got little response. He said regulators then took the unusual step of contacting top management of the bank's central offices. ""When we contacted the head offices, it was because we were very worried and didn't get a response"" from local management, who he said ""minimized the risks.""

The commission said Wednesday the violations began in the early 2000s.

HSBC Chief apologizes for lax controls
Senate says cartel money laundered at HSBC

A U.S. Senate investigative committee said that in 2007 and 2008 HSBC Mexico sent north about $7 billion in cash. ""Bulk cash shipments could reach that volume only if they included illegal drug proceeds,"" the committee concluded in a report.

HSBC Mexico acknowledged in a statement that it failed to report 39 suspicious transactions and had been late in reporting 1,729 others.

""HSBC Mexico recognizes it failed to strictly comply with banking regulations, and with the standards that regulators and clients expect of our institution,"" the bank said.

The banking commission said the bank began to respond with ""drastic and assertive"" corrective measures in late 2008. HSBC noted that in 2009, it became the first Mexican bank to completely stop handling cash dollar transactions.

In 2010, the government imposed strict limits on cash transactions in U.S. dollars at all Mexican banks, limiting tourists and residents who don't have accounts at Mexican banks to exchanging $1,500 a month or less.

HSBC said it had implemented all the regulators' recommendations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, getting more information on clients and refusing to do business with clients who appeared dodgy.

""HSBC regrets that actions in the past, which have been corrected, affect the bank's image today,"" the bank said.

Babatz said that in the past HSBC had appealed fines that regulators had levied in the courts. It was unclear whether the Wednesday announcement marked a change in that policy.

The banking commission president said details of the scandal first emerged in the U.S. Senate committee report because Mexico's ""extremely restrictive"" legal framework doesn't allow regulators to announce investigations or fines until all appeals are exhausted.

He said banks in Mexico had used intensive lobbying to get favorable regulatory rules, and said those rules should be changed because they favor financial institutions and put regulators at a disadvantage.",am
504,"Federal prosecutors in New York urged a judge Wednesday to send a Turkish banker to prison for more than 15 years when he is sentenced later this month for causing immense risks to the national security of the United States.

Mehmet Atilla was convicted in January of conspiring to launder a billion dollars in Iranian oil revenue in violation of US sanctions.

At a time when the United States and the community of nations were engaged in the momentous undertaking of depriving the Government of Iran of funding for its malign and deadly activitiesincluding its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of delivering those weapons throughout the region and around the world; and its financial, logistical, and military support for terrorist organizations and acts of terrorismAtilla was a key player in massively undermining those efforts, prosecutors wrote in their sentencing submission.

Defense attorneys said a harsh sentence would be unfair and urged the judge to be lenient.

Unlike prosecutions involving massive frauds and staggering victim losses, here there are no victims who suffered a financial loss, defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing submission.

The defense also portrayed Atillah as a functionary in a conspiracy led by Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who pleaded guilty on the eve of trial and agreed to cooperate with the government.

Whatever Atillas role prosecutors said his offenses are in some respects without parallel and the immense risks that he and his co-conspirators created to the national security of the United States and to the safety and stability of the entire globe are similarly without ready comparison.

The case strained US-Turkey relations after testimony that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan signed off on parts of the scheme. Erdogan denied it and accused the U.S. of engaging in a plot against his country based on information from followers of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric based in Pennsylvania who Erdogan has blamed for a failed coup attempt.

Atilla is scheduled to be sentenced April 11.",am
505,"Diamonds are rare, so are the chances of a diamantaire defrauding a bank of more than Rs 11,300 crore. PNB's Brady House branch, less than a kilometer away from the swanky Nirav Modi diamond boutique in Kala Ghoda has become the epicenter of one of the largest banking fraud detected in the country.

Until a few days ago, Nirav Modi, the man at the centre of biggest scam at India's second largest public sector lender could be seen hobnobbing with Hollywood A-listers or cutting ribbons to open his upmarket diamond stores at some of the priciest locations across the world.

Modi, who grew up in Antwerp, the world's diamond capital, has his eponymous jewellery store on Madison Avenue in New York. The jewellery designer also boasts Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra as his brand ambassodor. According to Forbes, Wharton-dropout Nirav Modi has a net worth of $1.73 billion. He is said to have learned the tricks of the trade from his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi who is also the CMD popular jewellery brand Gitanjali Gems.

In 2010, Modi became the first Indian jeweller to be featured on the cover of Sotheby's and Christie's auction catalogues. Modi's jewels also fetched a whopping Rs 60 crore at the Christie's auction way back in 2010. But Modi's ambitious plan to have 100 boutique retail stores worldwide by 2025 seems to have been cut short following the allegations of one of India's biggest banking fraud.

Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government had seized assets worth Rs 1,300 crore belonging to Nirav Modi besides initiating revocation of his passport. A lookout notice against the Surat-born diamond jewellery designer has already been issued by the CBI.

The fraud, incidentally, is 49 times the net profit posted by PNB for quarter ending December 31, 2017 and more than twice the amount that PNB got under bank recapitalisation plan.

PNB FRAUD
Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from one of its branches for overseas credit from other Indian lenders.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday conducted raids on jeweller Nirav Modi's properties in Mumbai, Surat and Delhi. A case of money laundering has also been lodged against Nirav Modi and others.

In a statement issued to exchanges, Punjab National Bank on Wednesday said it has detected some fraudulent and unauthorised transactions (messages) in one of its branch in Mumbai for the benefit of a few select account holders with their apparent connivance.

""Based on these transactions other banks appear to have advanced money to these customers abroad. In the Bank these transactions are contingent in nature and liability arising out of these on the Bank shall be decided based on the law and genuineness of underlying transactions,"" it said.

PNB has suspended 10 officers over the Rs 11,400 crore scam and referred the matter to CBI for investigation. According to media reports, Nirav Modi left the country on January 1 weeks before the CBI received complaint from PNB on January 29.

His brother Nishal, a Belgian citizen, also left the country on January 1, while wife Ami, a US citizen, and business partner Mehul Choksi, the Indian promoter of Gitanjali jewellery chain, departed on January 6.

MODUS OPERANDI

The Punjab National Bank in a letter on February 12 warned the other banks by revealing the modus operandi used by bank officials of PNB's Brady House branch.

In the letter, PNB said, ""It was found through SWIFT trail that one 'junior level' branch official unauthorisedly and fraudulently issued Letter of Undertakings (LoUs) on behalf of some companies belonging to Nirav Modi Group viz. Solar Exports, Stellar Diamonds and Diamond R US for availing buyers credit from overseas branches of Indian banks.""

None of the transactions were routed through the CBS system, thus avoiding early detection of fraudulent activity, it added. The bank also cautioned of a similar modus operandi used by the same branch official in companies belonging to Gitanjali Gems Ltd, promoted by Mehul Choksi viz. Gitanjali Gems, Gili India and Nakshatra while issuing LOUs.

In case of LoUs, it has been found that at the time of issuing LoUs for a smaller amount by SWIFT, the transaction was routed throuth the CBS system but subsequently, amendments were made in these LoUs by substantially enhancing the amount of LoUs and transmitted through SWIFT without routing these enhancements through CBS.

LOUs were opened in favour of overseas branches of Indian banks for import of pearls for a period of one year, for which as per RBI guidelines, the total time period allowed is 90 days from the date of shipment. Union Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank are said to have offered credit based on letters of undertaking (LOUs) issued by PNB.

Among those named is a deputy manager, Gokulnath Shetty, who was posted at PNBs foreign exchange department in Mumbai since March 31, 2010. He had allegedly along with another official Manoj Kharat fraudulently issued LoUs to these firms without following prescribed procedure or making entries in the banking system, avoiding detection of transactions.

DETECTION

When Nirav Modi companies asked for LoUs for raising buyers' credit after the retirement of the PNB employee involved in the scam, the Punjab National Bank sought 100 per cent cash margins for issuing LoUs. This was contested by the Nirav Modi firms, saying they had availed of the facility from as early as 2010.

NIRAV MODI SAGA

Nirav Modi, his wife Ami, brother Nishal and Mehul Choksi are partners in Diamonds R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds, which has shops in foreign locations such as Hong Kong, Dubai, and New York.

Modi, who had figured in the Forbes list of richest Indians, moved to India in 1990. The Nirav Modi store in New York shares space with legendary brands such as Chanel, Hermes, Prada and Gucci, and the designer is known to be shelling out a whopping $1.5 million a year as rental for the store. The store launch was graced by celebrity guests such as US presidential contender Donald Trump, Hollywood actress Naomi Watts and leading model Coca Rocha. Modi even walked the Red Carpet at the Oscars alongside Kate Winslet, who was adorned in a Nirav Modi jewel. Thereafter, he has opened stores on the Old Bond Street in London, Hong Kong and Macau.",am
506,"The Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer has resigned and chairman Lindsay Maxsted will step down early following the money-laundering scandal involving allegations the bank failed to stop transactions with the Philippines involving child exploitation.

Hartzer will be paid $2.69m for doing nothing for the next 12 months while serving out his notice period, the bank said in an announcement to the ASX on Tuesday morning.

He will not get a short-term bonus this year and will lose any long-term bonuses that have not already vested, Westpac said.

Pressure had been mounting on Hartzer and Maxsted to quit since last Wednesday, when the financial intelligence agency Austrac launched legal action accusing the bank of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws over more than $11bn in transactions.

The most damaging allegations revolved around Westpacs alleged failure to monitor customers sending money to the Philippines and other locations in south east Asia in a way consistent with child exploitation.

Austracs allegations sparked investigations from the federal police, the corporate regulator and the prudential regulator, the announcement of a potential class action, a warning of a possible ratings downgrade from Moodys and pushed Westpacs share price down four days running.

Hartzer, who last week promised he would stay and fix the problem, will finish next Monday and chief financial officer Peter King will become acting chief executive, Westpac said.

As CEO I accept that I am ultimately accountable for everything that happens at the bank, Hartzer said. And it is clear that we have fallen well short of what the community expects of us, and we expect of ourselves.

Maxsted, who has been on the Westpac board since 2008 and chairman since 2011, said he would bring forward his retirement as chairman to the first half of 2020.

Ewen Crouch, who has been on the board since 2013, will not seek re-appointment at the companys annual meeting on 12 December.

Crouch was listed on the AGM notice paper as up for re-election alongside Nerida Caesar, who has been on the board for two years, and Peter Marriott, who has served six years.

Westpac will also abandon a motion calling for shareholders to approve long-term bonuses for management.

The moves come after a week of steadily increasing pressure from politicians, including a threat from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that the board could be disqualified. The bank held crisis meetings with major investors on Monday.

Class action shareholder lawsuits are also likely, with law firm Phi Finney McDonald first to announce it was investigating the bank on Monday.

Hartzer is reported to have told staff during a meeting on Monday that the crisis was not an Enron or Lehman Brothers and was not resonating with ordinary Australians.

For people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we dont need to overcook this, he was quoted as saying in the Australian.

He also reportedly cancelled the banks Christmas party.",am
507,"(CNN) The son of former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has been formally charged following an investigation into the unlawful printing of local currencies running into the millions of dollars.

On Monday, Charles Sirleaf, deputy governor of the central bank of Liberia (CBL), and two others -- Dorbor Hagba, director of banking, and Milton Weeks, the former bank president -- faced multiple charges, including economic sabotage, misuse of public funds and criminal facilitation, state media reported.

CNN has been unable to reach Charles Sirleaf, Hagba or Weeks for comment.

The three are being held without bail until a trial begins, according to state media. Two other bank officials wanted in the case are said to be on the run.

An investigation into the alleged disappearance of bank notes worth more than $100 million -- about 4.75% of Liberia's gross domestic product -- was launched in October by the US-based investigative firm Kroll Associates Inc. at the direction of Liberia's government.

In a final report released Thursday, Kroll said it found no evidence the bank notes went missing, as local media had reported earlier. According to the report, the money made it into the central bank's coffers. But Kroll also said that more money was printed than had been approved by the legislature.

Kroll raised concerns over what it called ""discrepancies at every stage of the process for controlling the movement of bank notes"" into and out of the central bank during its review into the bank's activities.

The US Embassy in Liberia, which commissioned Kroll for the investigation, said the report ""identifies systemic and procedural weaknesses at the (central bank of Liberia), and identifies shortcomings in Liberia's fiscal and monetary management processes that are longstanding and continue to the present day.""

The suspected disappearance of money led to widespread protests on the streets of the capital of Monrovia when the news first broke in October.

Faced with public anger and a social media campaign by protesters demanding to ""bring back our money,"" Liberian President George Weah ordered the investigation that led to this week's charges.

CNN was unable to reach a spokesman for Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was in power during the period under investigation. The Nobel Prize-winning leader stepped down last year after two terms as Liberia's President.",am

The US has offered a $3m (£1.94m) reward for information on a Russian hacker, the highest the US authorities have ever offered in a cybercrime case.

Evgeniy Bogachev was charged last year in the US with being behind a major cybercrime operation that allegedly stole more than $100m (£64.7m).

He was last seen in Russia, where he is believed to remain at large.

Arresting him may be difficult, as the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia.

Mr Bogachev, also known as ""lucky12345"" and ""slavik"", is accused of running the GameOver Zeus attack network, thought to have infected more than one million computers.

Victims were tricked into downloading malware - malicious software - which then searched specifically for financial information.

'60 cyber-threats'

Evgeniy Bogachev was charged last year on counts including conspiracy, wire, bank and computer fraud, and money laundering, after the FBI said it broke up the network.

He is one of the FBI's most wanted cyber-criminals.

""This reward offer reaffirms the commitment of the US government to bring those who participate in organized crime to justice, whether they hide online or overseas,"" the US State Department said.

The reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Mr Bogachev.

The head of the FBI's cyber crime division, Joseph Demarest, said Russia's internal security agency had expressed an interest in working with the US on cybercrimes, according to Reuters, but did not link it to the Bogachev case.

He also said the agency was aware of 60 different cyber-threat groups linked to nation-states, but gave no further details.

509,"PORTLAND, Ore.U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams announced today that Robert J. Jesenik, 61, a former chief executive officer of Aequitas Management, LLC and several other Aequitas-owned entities, has been indicted along with three other former company executives for their roles in a fraud and money laundering conspiracy.

Jesenik, a former resident of West Linn, Oregon, is charged in a 32-count indictment with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. Also charged are Nelson Scott Gillis, 67, of Lake Oswego, Oregon; Brian K. Rice, 54, of Portland; and Andrew N. MacRitchie, 56, formerly of Palm Harbor, Florida.

According to court documents, Jesenik, Gillis, MacRitchie, Rice, and others used the Lake Oswego company to solicit investments in a variety of notes and funds, many of which were purportedly backed by trade receivables in education, health care, transportation, and other consumer credit areas.

From June 2014 through February 2016, the former executives solicited investors by misrepresenting the companys use of investor money, the financial health and strength of Aequitas and its related companies, and the risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. Collectively, the defendants also failed to disclose other critical facts about the company, including its near-constant liquidity and cash-flow crises, the use of investor money to repay other investors and to defray operating expenses, and the lack of collateral to secure funds.

Jesenik founded the Aequitas group of companies, and, as chief executive officer, controlled the organizations structure and had ultimate decision-making authority over company activities.

Gillis, who was previously indicted for conspiring to submit false statements to a federally insured creditor, was the companys chief operating officer and chief financial officer. In these roles, he was responsible for directing Aequitass overall financial policies and accounting functions. He established and maintained the companys accounting principles, practices, procedures and initiatives, prepared financial reports and presented findings and recommendations to the executive teams, and oversaw all financial functions.

MacRitchie was the companys executive vice president and chief compliance officer. As such, he was responsible for the development and implementation of risk management and compliance processes and procedures. MacRitchie oversaw all Aequitas accounting, legal, and audit functions, and participated in fundraising. He also established Aequitass New York Office and directed Aequitass Lux Fund, a Luxembourg-based fund used to solicit international investors.

Rice served as Aequitass executive vice president and president of wealth management. Among his responsibilities, Rice oversaw the solicitation of investments through registered investment advisors (RIA) and managed Aequitass affiliated RIAs.

If convicted on all charges, each of the defendants could face decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines and restitution, as well as five years supervised release following their prison terms.

Former Aequitas executives and co-conspirators Brian A. Oliver and Olaf Janke previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and money laundering on April 19, 2019, and June 10, 2019, respectively. As part of their plea agreements, they have both agreed to pay restitution in full to their victims as determined and ordered by the court.

An indictment is only an accusation of a crime, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

This case is being investigated by the FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration. It is being prosecuted by Scott E. Bradford and Ryan W. Bounds, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.",am

""In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartel - a cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murder - to operate with impunity in Mexico,"" prosecutors alleged in a court document released on Friday.

Prosecutors say they have evidence of communications between Gen Cienfuegos and a senior leader of the H-2 Cartel.

They have requested that Mr Cienfuegos be held in detention until his trial, arguing the general poses ""a significant risk of flight"".

Should he be convicted, the former defence minister could face a jail term of ten years or more, prosecutors say.

Earlier, the Mexican government confirmed to the BBC that Gen Cienfuegos was arrested on a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) warrant.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the arrest ""serves to illustrate that the main problem in Mexico is corruption"".

President López Obrador, who was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2018, has accused his predecessors of running a ""narco-government"" that allowed corruption.

He is seeking to lift the immunity of former leaders from prosecution.

Gen Cienfuegos, 72, served as minister from 2012 to 2018, under President Enrique Peña Nieto.

His role as the most senior member of the armed forces meant he played a key role in Mexico's war on drugs.

But there were accusations of complicity between the state and the country's powerful drug cartels throughout Mr Peña Nieto's presidency, reports BBC Mexico correspondent Will Grant.

Earlier this year, one of the former president's closest advisers was extradited to Mexico from Spain on corruption charges.

Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of Mexican state oil company Pemex, is accused of taking $10m (£8m) in bribes from a Brazilian construction firm that has admitted paying off Latin American politicians. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Peña Nieto has not been implicated.

Gen Cienfuegos is not the first former Mexican minister to have been arrested in the US.

Last December, former Security Minister Genaro García Luna was charged with taking bribes from a drugs cartel.

Mr García Luna, who was Mexico's top security chief from 2006 to 2012, is currently on trial in New York, accused of allowing the Sinaloa cartel of ""El Chapo"" Guzman to operate in Mexico in exchange for millions of dollars.",am
512,"Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that they have charged Malaysian financier Jho Low and two former Goldman Sachs bankers in a multibillion-dollar money-laundering scandal.

Low was the alleged mastermind behind the embezzlement of $4.5 billion from the 1MDB Malaysian development fund, much of which was allegedly used to buy luxury real estate, art, a yacht, and to invest in films, including ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""

Low and Roger Ng, a Malaysian banker at Goldman Sachs, were indicted on three counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, bribery, and circumvention of accounting controls, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Ng was arrested Thursday in Malaysia. Low, who is believed to be in China, remains at large.

The government also unsealed a criminal complaint against Tim Leissner, Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman. Leissner has pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the FCPA. He has been ordered to forfeit $43.7 million.

Federal prosecutors had earlier filed two civil forfeiture actions in an effort to recoup more than $1 billion of the stolen funds. According to those complaints, more than $100 million of the Malaysian development funds were diverted to Red Granite Pictures, the producer of ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" ""Daddy's Home,"" and ""Dumb and Dumber To."" Red Granite was run by Riza Aziz, the stepson of Najib Razak, the former Malaysian prime minister.

513,"China's top asset manager Lai Xiaomin made 258 million dollars in bribes and had a hundred mistresses. Lai's story is extraordinary so much so, that Chinas state broadcaster CCTV has made a documentary about him.

Reports say Lai had kept 300 million yuan in a bank account in his mothers name.

Xiaomin was one of chinas four big bad asset managers and in 10 years, he used his position to solicit bribes in exchange for favours.

In his career, he worked with several key government institutions. Xiaomin served as department director with the Peoples Bank of China, as well as the China banking regulatory commission. He was appointed chairman of the Huarong Asset Management company in 2012. All of these come under the Chinese government and Xiaomin represented the communist party in these departments.

In his last job, Lai was also the deputy party chief for his company's communist party wing. Those positions allowed Lai to run perhaps the biggest corruption racket in the Chinese banking system.

The scandal was revealed two years ago. Now Lai has pleaded guilty. The Chinese state has turned on Lai. The hearing in the case was held in public. Apart from tonnes of cash, Lai had a string of affairs. Reports say he had more than 100 mistresses. Many of whom received management positions at the subsidiaries of Huarong.

China claims the crackdown against Lai is a big victory against corruption but this case of the fallen banker exposes Beijing and the deep-rooted dishonesty within Chinas corrupt meritocracy",am
514,"New York (CNN Business) Texas tech mogul Robert T. Brockman has been charged in a $2 billion tax evasion case, the largest ever tax charge in the United States, law enforcement officials said.

A federal grand jury returned an indictment alleging that Brockman, the CEO of software company Reynolds & Reynolds, engaged in tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering and other crimes as part of a nearly 20-year scheme to conceal around $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service and defraud investors in his software firm's debt securities, federal authorities said in a release.

The 39-count indictment  filed earlier this month in the Northern District of California and unsealed this week  reads at times like a screenplay: Allegations against Brockman include operating a complex web of foreign companies and bank accounts; using unreported taxable income to buy a luxury yacht called ""Turmoil;"" creating an encrypted email system to communicate with employees using code names such as ""Bonefish"" and ""Snapper;"" asking a money manager to attend a ""money laundering conference"" under an assumed identity; and persuading that same money manager to destroy documents and electronic media using shredders and hammers.

""Dollar amounts aside, I have not seen this pattern of greed or concealment and cover-up in my 25+ years as a special agent,"" Jim Lee, chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation Unit, said during a press conference.

Brockman founded Universal Computer Systems, a computer systems and software provider for car dealerships, in 1970. In 2006, the company merged with Reynolds & Reynolds, of which Brockman is now CEO and chairman. Prior to Universal Computer Systems, he served in the US Marines, and worked for Ford (F) and IBM (IBM).

Brockman made an initial federal court appearance Friday, where he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released on a $1 million bond, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

""We look forward to defending him against these charges,"" Kathryn Keneally, counsel for Brockman, said in a statement to CNN Business. Keneally is a former Assistant Attorney General of the US Department of Justice Tax Division.

A spokesperson for Reynolds & Reynolds said the allegations in the indictment focus on activities Brockman engaged in ""outside of his professional responsibilities with Reynolds & Reynolds,"" according to a statement provided to CNN Business. ""The company is not alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing, and we are confident in the integrity and strength of our business.""

Brockman, an investor in Vista Equity Partners, allegedly used offshore entities in Bermuda and Nevis and secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland to hide from the IRS income he earned on his investments in the fund, according to the indictment. Vista Equity Partners is a private equity firm that invests in software, data and technology startups; its founder, chairman and CEO, Robert Smith, cooperated with officials in the investigation.

The indictment also alleges that Brockman took measures such as asking employees to backdate records and using encrypted communications to conceal the alleged scheme. Brockman is also alleged to have fraudulently purchased nearly $68 million of his software company's debt securities, while maintaining insider information about the company.

If convicted, Brockman faces ""a substantial period of incarceration,"" authorities said, as well as restitution and criminal forfeiture.

Smith, of Vista Equity Partners, accepted responsibility for his role in the alleged tax evasion scheme and agreed to a non-prosecution agreement, officials said. Vista Equity Partners declined to comment.

Officials say Smith, 57, hid money in offshore accounts in Belize and Nevis. Smith used his untaxed income to buy a vacation home in Sonoma, ski properties in the French Alps and to make charitable donations including the maintenance of a home in Colorado for inner city children and wounded veterans, authorities said. As part of a settlement with the Justice Department, Smith will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, abandon his $182 million protective refund claim and pay interest, but will avoid prosecution.

""It is never too late to tell the truth. Smith committed serious crimes, but he also agreed to cooperate,"" said US Attorney David Anderson. ""Smith's agreement to cooperate has put him on a path, away from the indictment.""",am
515,"A judge has sentenced the fake German heiress Anna Sorokin to four to 12 years in prison for defrauding hotels, restaurants, a private jet operator and banks out of more than $200,000.

Judge Diane Kiesel said she was stunned by the depth of the defendants deception, her labyrinthine lies that kept her con afloat at the sentencing on Thursday afternoon in Manhattan state court. As she handed down sentence, Kiesel reportedly made a reference to Bruce Springsteens song Blinded by the Light.

She was blinded by the glitter and glamour of New York City, the judge said, according to BuzzFeed News.

Sorokin, a would-be art collector, planned to open a members-only arts club but became known as the Soho grifter after her deception upon New Yorks glitzy social scene came to light. Sorokin, 28, was found guilty last month of grand larceny and theft of services.

During the trial she was admonished for throwing tantrums when she couldnt get her stylist-curated outfits, and drew unflattering sketches of the lead prosecutor during testimony.

But at sentencing she was humbled. Wearing a long-sleeved black dress, she told the judge: I apologize for the mistakes I made.

Sorokins story became a media sensation, and she received lengthy profiles in magazines and reams of tabloid coverage. A TV series about her life was also planned.

At the trial, prosecutors said she overdrew a bank account and forged financial records to further the ruse that she perpetrated under the name Anna Delvey. The jury agreed she had fraudulently maneuvered herself into the best position to take money from a social milieu of wealthy collectors, dealers and auctioneers.

Prosecutors said Sorokins ambition was to live the fantasy of an extravagant lifestyle beyond her means. But her lawyers argued that Sorokin was hardly unique in understanding that superficial glamour was key to acceptance in the circles she aspired to join.

 Fake it until you make it,  explained her lawyer, Todd Spodek. He conceded that his clients practice was unethical but, he claimed, not illegal because she planned to pay everyone back. Any millennial will tell you, he said, it is not uncommon to have delusions of grandeur.

The jury rejected some of the charges against her, including an alleged attempt to fraudulently obtain a $22m (£17m) loan, and an accusation that she had swindled $60,000 from a friend who had paid for a lavish trip to Morocco.

Prosecutors told the court Sorokin now has barely a cent to her name.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has said it will seek to deport Sorokin, who was born in Russia, to Germany following her release from state custody. Ice said Sorokin overstayed her 2017 visa.",am
516,"The founder and chief executive officer of Backpage.com, a website linked to human trafficking, has pleaded guilty to charges including conspiring to facilitate prostitution and money laundering.

Carl Ferrer, 57, of Frisco, Texas, will face a maximum of five years in prison. Part of his plea agreement with federal and state authorities includes forfeiting all corporate assets related to the website and making sure it's permanently shuttered.

Federal authorities seized control of the website last week so ""it can no longer be used by criminals to promote and facilitate human trafficking,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement released by the Department of Justice on Thursday.

""For far too long, Backpage.com existed as the dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike,"" Sessions said. ""But this illegality stops right now.""

Ferrer ""has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution using a facility in interstate or foreign commerce and to engage in money laundering,"" according to the DOJ statement.

Ferrer's plea deal also covers Backpage-related charges in California and Texas, according to court documents.

California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra said Ferrer pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of money laundering. As part of the deal, Ferrer will cooperate in aiding the prosecution of two controlling shareholders of the website. Those cases remain in Sacramento Superior Court.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Ferrer pleaded guilty to money laundering and that his company is pleading guilty to human trafficking.

""According to the factual basis of his plea agreement, Ferrer admitted that he had long been aware that the great majority of Backpage's 'escort' and 'adult' advertisements are, in fact, advertisements for prostitution services, which are not protected by the First Amendment and which are illegal in 49 states and in much of Nevada,"" the DOJ statement said. ""Ferrer further admitted that he conspired with other Backpage principals to find ways to knowingly facilitate the state-law prostitution crimes being committed by Backpage's customers.""

Since 2004, according to the DOJ, Backpage ""has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from publishing 'escort' and 'adult' ads.""",am
517,"The Chairman of Liberia's ruling Unity Party, Varney Sherman spent Monday barricaded inside his Monrovia home as members of the Presidential Taskforce Investigating the recent Global Witness Report, backed by police officers, came to search his premises.

A crowd of partisans gathered outside to support Sherman, one of Liberia's most powerful political figures. Others were there to support the investigation into a damning report issued by the international corruption watchdog Global Witness (GW), titled The Deceivers detailing how the British company Edmond and Groves bribed their way into huge acquisitions in Liberia, Mozambique and Guinea.

The Taskforce, set up by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to investigate the alleged corruption by top government officials sent shockwaves through Monrovia when it issued arrest warrants and court subpoenas of financial statements to help with the investigation.

The Task Force's head, Liberian lawyer Cllr. J. Fonati Koffa, began executing a series of arrests and a search warrant for the Sherman and Sherman law firm owned by Sherman. Koffa was Chairman of the opposition Liberty Party until his appointment by the President as Minister of State without Portfolio one week before the release of the Global Witness Report.

The report released May 11th, details how Sable Mining Africa Limited, a subsidiary of Edmond and Groves, pushed its way through an already corrupt business climate in Liberia, making use of highly placed public officials to get their deals sealed. The company even went a step further by using bribes to change Liberian law to gain greater access to a much coveted mineral deposit inside Mt. Wologizi.

Sable allegedly went through the countrys most powerful men: The Speaker of the House of Representatives J. Alex Tyler, the Chairman of the Ruling Party now Senator of Grand Cape Mt. County, Sherman, the then head of the National Investment Commission Richard Tolbert, Presidential aide, now Senator, Morris Saytumah and a number of other powerful people.

By August 2010 Sable had paid out more than $200,000 earmarked for some of the most powerful people in Liberia, Global Witness states in its report. Another $500,000 was intended for two important figures known only as Bigboy 01 and Bigboy 02. Speculation into their identities is rampant.

The payments are listed in a cache of documents leaked to Global Witness, including a spreadsheet from Shermans law firm listing many of the biggest sums. Alongside the bribes, thousands more went on entertaining the presidents son, the documents show.

This well organized corruption allegation has caused serious outrage in Liberia, not because the people are surprised by it, but simply because they feel President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has not done enough to fight corruption by bringing people accused misusing the public trust to book.

Christian Nelson a Liberian talk show host, now based in the US, believes the fight against corruption in Liberia is nurtured by a system of governance where the executive refuses to exercise oversight power.

Why corruption is the way it is in Liberia is simple, no system, plus laws are not enforced, he said in an email to Okayafrica.

Since the birth of the nation, writes Nelson, Liberia has made the fight against corruption priority number one but cannot get past stage one. Oh yes, there are enough laws on the books to even send Satan to hell so why is Satan still hanging around?

Nelsons views reflect how many Liberians feel about the fight against corruption. Many of these public officials take these corruption allegations as a joke, even using the media in Liberia to ridicule the GW findings.

The President has gone beyond just setting up a board of inquiry into these grave allegations, giving the team prosecutorial powers to go after anyone who is found culpable in the GW report.

Yet the Chairman of the ruling Unity Party Cllr. Varney Sherman has been adamant that he will not submit himself to the panel set up by the President to investigate these allegations of bribery.

Is there a place in our jurisprudence where the accused submits himself to an investigation? Sherman asked a local talk show host Mamadee Diakite on last Tuesday.

If you know I have done something illegal, do your investigation and go to court but dont ask me to submit myself to an investigatio. I cannot submit myself to an investigation where I have been accused of committing a crime.

This refusal of Sherman refuses to appear before the committee to answer questions about his involvement in the Sable mining deal, has led the committee to take the stand that it is taking now by seeking police enforcement to make him comply. But during this same interview last week Sherman gave some clues on what his role in Sable Mining deal was.

""Since Sable Mining was not registered to do business in Liberia as a company, it couldn't open a bank account, Sherman said.

You can open a bank account in Liberia to the best of my knowledge, only if you are a resident of Liberia or a company registered to do business in Liberia. Since they were not registered to do business in Liberia, to get funds from England to them in Liberia for whatever they were doing in Liberia, that's when we offered our accounts at International Bank where funds came in for them and we delivered their funds to them as and when they asked.""

Now the question is how many more public officials who own private entities are doing this? Why is Sherman not being asked the right questions? There seems to be a huge conflict of interest here as Sherman was Chairman of the Ruling Party and others involved held key positions in government and had immense power to influence decision making.

Sherman was Sable Minings lawyer and banker at the same time. Such conflict of interest is illegal in Liberia, especially as it relates to public officials.

The Liberian code of conduct for public officials states: 1.3.6 Conflict of Interest: is when a public official, contrary to official obligations and duties to act for the benefit of the public, exploits a relationship for personal benefit.

But the Committee Chair Koffa in a statement to OkayAfrica said his committee has invited all those implicated in the GW report and if they are found culpable, they would be forwarded for prosecution.

Our work is a national duty. We will go where the evidence leads us without fear or favor, said Cllr. Koffa.

Despite this assurance some Liberians are looking at the committee as just another one of those appointed by the President that may have no impact. This pessimism from the Presidents critics stems from the Presidents inability to prosecute officials in her government who have been indicted by several audit reports. Some feel she has not stayed true to these words uttered when she took office in 2006: Corruption, under my administration, will be the major public enemy.

But supporters of the President still believe that she is resolved to fight corruption as promised more than ten years ago. Togba Emmanuel, a student of International Security Studies at Coventry University in the U.K told OkayAfrica via email that the President has done a lot to fight corruption, but the challenges are embedded in a political culture built over the years that ridicules honesty.

How can her government be cleansed of corruption is a question that is grim to answer, Emmanuel Said.

The roots go so deep and demand such a radical reordering, among other things, the appointment of an independent Taskforce charged to investigate the Sable bribery links will serve the purpose for a new day if treated with sincerity.

Despite these strides, many Liberians are skeptical about the final outcome of this investigation many feel it is just another charade by the President to show-off to the international community but the response to these allegations has been met by huge public outrage both at home and abroad. These actions taken by President Johnson Sirleaf against the alleged perpetrators would go a long way in showing that she is sincere about fighting corruption.",am
518,"An Italian mafia super fugitive, Marco Di Lauro, has been arrested in Naples after over 14 years on the run.

Di Lauro (38) was arrested without a fight on Saturday at a modest apartment where he lived with his wife in the citys Chiaiano district, police said. He was sitting with his two cats and eating pasta when police arrested him in an operation involving around 150 officers.

The Naples police chief, Antonio De Iesu, told a press conference unusual activity had led police to the suspect, previously convicted of criminal association. Police found no weapons and a small sum of money in the flat.

An international arrest warrant was issued for Di Lauro in 2006, and he was one of Italys four most-wanted criminals, according to the interior ministry website. He is the fourth son of Paolo Di Lauro, the former boss of a clan of the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia.

Italian media said Marco Di Lauro was considered the second-most dangerous man in Italy, after the Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro.

The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, tweeted his thanks to the police for the arrest of the super fugitive. The interior minister, Matteo Salvini, voiced congratulations for a very important operation.

The high-profile arrest was reportedly linked to the murder earlier in the day of the wife of a man linked to Di Lauro, Salvatore Tamburrino.

Tamburrino handed himself in for shooting dead his wife, Norina Mattuozzo, shortly before Di Lauros arrest. De Iesu refused to confirm or deny a link between the murder and Di Lauros arrest.

Di Lauro had been on the run since escaping a police swoop in 2004 known as the night of the handcuffs. An informant said in 2010 that Di Lauro was responsible for at least four murders.

Paolo Di Lauro has been in prison since 2005, and Marco had reportedly taken over running the much-weakened clan. At least 130 people were killed in a bloody power struggle after the Amato-Pagano clan split from the Di Lauro clan in 2004.

Marco Di Lauro, reportedly known within the family by the code F4 for fourth son, had nine brothers and one sister. All the brothers are now either in prison or dead, Italian newspapers reported.  AFP",am

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's nominee for agriculture minister in the new cabinet is on an Interpol wanted list for tax evasion in Estonia, a fact Ghani's spokesman said was unknown to his office at the time of his nomination.

Interpol's website lists Mohammad Yaqub Haidari, 52, as wanted in Estonia for ""large-scale tax evasion, fraudulent conversion"" in cases dating back to 2003.

A spokesman for Ghani, Nazifullah Salarzai, said Saturday that the presidential office was unaware Haidari had any legal troubles but was investigating.

Although Haidari has been on the wanted list for years, it was not widely known or reported in Afghanistan.

Ghani, who was sworn in as president last year to replace long-time leader Hamid Karzai, has vowed to root out widespread corruption and said he would choose his ministers based on their qualifications, not their connections.

His nominations were announced on Monday, after a wait of more than three months.

Haidari confirmed Saturday that he is on the Interpol wanted list but insisted he is innocent.

""I am being targeted by a political conspiracy. When you enter the world of business and politics, this is what happens,"" he told Reuters.

He said that the taxes were owed not by him but by a person who bought a company from him that did business in Estonia.

A biography of Haidari compiled by the Afghanistan Analysts Network cited a recent television interview in which he said he once ran an agricultural import-export company that did business in eastern Europe and Russia.

His current business is focused on construction and information technology as well as agricultural products, the profile said.

524,"Why isn't a bigger deal being made about the scandals involving President Donald Trump's secretary of commerce, investor Wilbur Ross?

Although Forbes broke a story earlier this week about Ross allegedly betting against a company's stock after being contacted by journalists about his background with that firm, the most comprehensive and succinct summary of the scandals surrounding Ross came from this piece by ProPublica.

Theres a chance you missed it amid the other news, but Forbes had a blockbuster story about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. It turns out, Ross bet against the stock of a company after journalists had contacted him with questions about his connections to the firm. Using inside information in stock trades is illegal. Ross has denied he profited from the bet against the stock.

And thats only one of the revelations from Forbes story. Trump, Inc. spoke to reporter Dan Alexander about what else he found. Ross transferred many of his assets to a family trust last fall. Among those assets: an auto parts firm owned jointly with a Chinese-government-owned entity, and a stake in a shipping company also owned in part by Russian oligarchs.

Fortunately, the ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and Acting Director of the Office of Government Ethics David J. Apol requesting an investigation of Ross's actions, according to The Washington Post. Specifically they want to learn more about whether Ross lied about divesting his stock from Invesco, the firm he ran before becoming Secretary of Commerce, as well as to learn more about the circumstances surrounding Ross's decision to sell shares of the shipping firm Navigator Holdings.

Ross himself appeared on the CBNC show ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday to refute the accusations.

""Well first of all, the holdings to which they're referring have all been divested, so it's at best ancient news,"" Ross declared. ""Everything that's been done has been done in compliance with the Office of Government Ethics. So these are people second-guessing everything...""

After Ross was questioned about whether his family and relatives would benefit from the trusts that were established with his assets, which in theory could still pose a conflict of interest for him, Ross insisted that this wasn't the case.

""Well, that's simply not true. We've divested of the assets,"" Ross told his hosts. ""I have no control over the purchases and sales within the trusts. We're not income beneficiaries. We're not equity beneficiaries. I have no economic interests in those trusts. But many of the assets were not put into the trusts anyway. It was only the ones that were very difficult to sell. Everything that was readily salable was sold. So the idea of trusts that meet very specified criteria has been part of government for a very, very long time. It's not something peculiar to the Trump administration. It is true of all prior administrations so people may say 'Oh well, tut tut.' The fact is that that's the established practice.""

He also denied that he had any investment-based connections to Russia.

""I don't have any investments in Russia. I never have,"" Ross insisted. ""What they're doing is innuendo. A company that I was invested in happened to have a Russian shareholder. Another company happened to do business with some companies in Russia, a shipping company. They take little tiny things and make them into something that they are not. And worst of all is that they don't pretend to really do the research. They just make these wild claims.""

When ""Squawk Box"" asked him specifically about the accusation that he had engaged in financial activity based on inside knowledge, he denied it.

""Well first of all, I began selling Navigator six months before that,"" Ross told his hosts. ""So this is not the first sale of Navigator that was made. What came about: These were shares that were originally part of the director compensation program. And some of them never really found their way physically to me. So when I found that there were some more shares than what I had sold months earlier, I got them moved into an account so I could sell them. It takes a while to effect the transfer and under the New York Stock Exchange rules, which is where Navigator, you've got to deliver within a couple of days.""

He added, ""So to make sure I didn't violate the rule, it was technically a short sale.""

When Salon contacted CREW on Wednesday about the Ross story, their press secretary Aaron Rodriguez was emphatic about how they were disturbed by the story.

""It is deeply troubling that Secretary Ross seems to have found a way to further profit from his own corruption scandal. This issue certainly needs to be closely examined to determine if ethics laws were violated,"" Rodriguez told Salon by email.

Corey Goldstone, media strategist at the nonpartisan election watchdog organization, the Campaign Legal Center (CLC), expressed similar thoughts.

""Secretary Ross appears to have made a false statement when he signed his ethics form attesting to divestiture of certain assets,"" Goldstone told Salon by email. ""It is important for cabinet-level secretaries to be truthful in their ethics disclosures so that the public can be confident that they are acting in good faith on behalf of the American people, rather than to enhance their bottom line.""

There are two possible reasons why the Ross scandal has not been more prominently featured in the news cycle. The first is that human rights stories like that of the Trump administration seizing children from undocumented immigrant parents at the border have been more pressing and have thus received more attention. The second is that, with scandals afflicting other Trump administration figures like Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson (to say nothing of the president himself), it may very well be that the press and public are suffering from scandal fatigue.

None of that, of course, would make Ross's actions acceptable if he is indeed guilty of abusing his public position to financially benefit on a personal level.",am

Cecilia Marogna had worked for Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a top Vatican official who was fired by Pope Francis last month and accused of embezzlement and nepotism. Becciu has denied all wrongdoing.

An Italian finance police official told Reuters that Marogna was arrested in Milan. Italian media reports said she was arrested under an international warrant issued by Vatican magistrates.

In recent days, Italian media have run interviews in which Marogna said she had received 500,000 ($587,350) from Becciu to run a parallel diplomacy to help missionaries in conflict zones. She has denied wrongdoing in the interviews.

526,"BHOPAL: The Jabalpur cyber police on Saturday arrested kingpin of cyber fraud who had activated 7,000 SIMs and had sold them to inter-state gang of cyber criminals.

The SP of Jabalpur cyber cell said a complaint was submitted by a resident Rajkumar Singh that someone had obtained a SIM in his name and was using it. On investigation, police found that 118 SIMs of BSNL were activated in the names of other people by Neelesh Sen and Krishna Mehra. On these SIMs, the Paytm wallets were activated and the numbers were transferred to West Bengal and other states.

The police have arrested kingpin Edwin Jacob who contacted cyber criminals to supply SIM.

These fraudsters used SIMs of BSNL, Idea/Vodafone. The police have seized mobile phones, deactivated SIMs, seized fake identity papers. The police have registered case under Sections 419,420,468,471,120(B) of IPC and 66 of IT Act against Neelesh Sen, Krishna Mehra and Edwin Jacob.

Inspector Hariom Dixit said fraudsters obtained SIM on papers submitted by people very casually. They asked people to submit KYC papers, which they did making it easy for them to take advantage and commit fraud.

In this case, the racketeers lured villagers by telling them that they will help them to draw benefits under government welfare schemes and took papers. These papers were used to obtain SIMs in their names. Jacob was involved in selling SIMs to cyber criminals while Neelesh and Krishna were involved in collecting papers from the villagers.",am
527,"Italian authorities seized euro23 million ($30 million) from a Vatican bank account Tuesday and said they have begun investigating top officials of the Vatican bank in connection with a money-laundering probe.

The Vatican said it was ""perplexed and surprised"" by the investigation.

Italian financial police seized the money as a precaution and prosecutors placed the Vatican bank's chairman and director general under investigation for alleged mistakes linked to violations of Italy's anti-laundering laws, news reports said.

The investigation is not the first trouble for the bank - formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion. In the 1980s, it was involved in a major scandal that resulted in a banker, dubbed ""God's Banker"" because of his close ties to the Vatican, being found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London.

The Vatican expressed full trust in the chairman of the bank, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, and his director-general, identified by the Vatican directory as Paolo Cipriani. It said the bank had been working for some time to make its finances more transparent to comply with anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering regulations.

""The Holy see is perplexed and surprised by the initiatives of the Rome prosecutors, considering the data necessary is already available at the Bank of Italy,"" it said in a statement.

Gotti Tedeschi told state-run RAI television that he was ""humiliated and mortified"" by news of the probe, which he said had arrived just as he was implementing new transparency procedures at the bank.

News reports circulated more than a year ago that Italian investigators were scrutinizing millions of euros worth of Vatican bank transactions to see if they violated money-laundering regulations.

In Tuesday's case, police seized the money from a Vatican bank account at the Rome branch of Credito Artigiano Spa, according to news agencies ANSA and Apcom. The bulk of the money, euro20 million ($26 million), was destined for JP Morgan in Frankfurt, with the remainder going to Banca del Fucino.

According to the reports, the Vatican bank had neglected to communicate to financial authorities where the money had come from. The reports stressed that Gotti Tedeschi wasn't being investigated for laundering money himself but for a series of alleged omissions in financial transactions.

Prosecutors declined requests seeking confirmation of the reports.

Gotti Tedeschi was named chairman of the bank a year ago after serving as the head of Italian operations for Spain's Banco Santander. A member of the conservative religious movement Opus Dei, Gotti Tedeschi frequently speaks out on the need for more morality in financing and is a very public cheerleader of Pope Benedict XVI's finance-minded encyclical ""Charity in Truth.""

""It's not difficult to show that applied ethics produces more wealth,"" he wrote in a July piece for the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. ""Ethical behavior means lower costs - just thinking about control measures alone - and allows for more value thanks to transparency and trust, which alone produce more certainty and fewer risks.""

News of the investigation came just after Benedict wrapped up a difficult trip to Britain and as the Vatican still reels from the fallout of the clergy sex abuse scandal.

The Vatican bank, located in a tower just inside the gates of Vatican City, isn't a typical bank. Its stated mission is to manage assets placed in its care that are destined for religious works or works of charity. But it also manages ATMs inside Vatican City and the pension system for the Vatican's thousands of employees.

The bank is not open to the public. Depositors are usually limited to Vatican employees, religious orders and people who transfer money for the pope's charities.

Its leadership is composed of five cardinals, one of whom is the Vatican's secretary of state. But the day-to-day operations are headed by Gotti Tedeschi and the bank's oversight council.

The Vatican bank was famously implicated in a scandal over the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano in the 1980s in one of Italy's largest fraud cases.

Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano, was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982 in circumstances that still remain mysterious.

London investigators first ruled that Calvi committed suicide, but his family pressed for further investigation. Eventually murder charges were filed against five defendants, including a major Mafia figure, and they were tried in Rome and acquitted in 2007.

Banco Ambrosiano collapsed following the disappearance of $1.3 billion in loans the bank had made to several dummy companies in Latin America. The Vatican had provided letters of credit for the loans.

While denying any wrongdoing, the Vatican bank agreed to pay $250 million to Ambrosiano's creditors.

The late Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, an American prelate who headed the Vatican bank at the time, was charged as an accessory to fraudulent bankruptcy in the scandal.

He left a villa in Rome two hours before police arrived for the safety of the Vatican, an independent city-state. Italy's Constitutional Court eventually backed the Vatican in ruling that under Vatican-Italian treaties Marcinkus enjoyed immunity from Italian prosecution. Marcinkus long asserted his innocence and died in 2006.

Last year, a U.S. appeals court dismissed a lawsuit against the Vatican bank filed by Holocaust survivors from Croatia, Ukraine and Yugoslavia who alleged it had accepted millions of dollars of their valuables stolen by Nazi sympathizers.

The court said the bank was immune from such a lawsuit under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally protects foreign countries from being sued in U.S. courts.

In its statement Tuesday, the Vatican also said it was working to join the so-called ""white list"" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which keeps tabs on financial openness on the exchange of tax information.

The OECD divides countries into three categories: those who comply with rules on sharing tax information (white list), those who say they will but have not acted yet (gray list), and nations which have not yet agreed to change banking secrecy practices (blacklist)

Currently the Vatican bank isn't on any OECD list.",am
528,"Defendants Include Two New York City Department of Education Employees

Two criminal complaints were unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging 11 members and associates of the New York City-based Bully street gang with crimes related to conspiracies to distribute drugs throughout Maine and in New York, smuggling drugs into Rikers Island, illegal weapons possession and money laundering. The initial appearances of six defendants arrested today in Brooklyn and New Jerseyalleged Bully gang member Derrick Ayers and gang associates Bermon Clarke, Amy Sonnenblick, Nia Govan, Paul Harris and Anthony Kennedyare scheduled for this afternoon before United States Chief Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak. Defendant Amanda Walton was arrested in Maine. Defendant Amanda Huard is currently not in custody. The remaining defendants were previously incarcerated.

Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, John B. DeVito, Special Agent-in-Charge, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, New York Field Division (ATF), Dermot F. Shea, Commissioner, New York City Police Department (NYPD), and Margaret Garnett, Commissioner, New York City Department of Investigation (DOI), announced the charges.

As alleged, these defendants trafficked narcotics between Maine and New York, including smuggling dangerous contraband drugs into Rikers Island, stated United States Attorney Donoghue. Drug dealers, and those who launder their drug proceeds, destroy lives and communities and, in this case, jeopardized the safety and security of a prison.

Mr. Donoghue expressed his grateful appreciation to the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Maine, New Hampshire State Police, Maine State Police, Brewer Maine Police Department, Waterville Maine Police Department and Augusta Maine Police Department for their assistance in the case.

These arrests will undoubtedly have a significant impact on public safety. As alleged, these gang members and their associates plagued communities from New York City to Maine, but today, thanks to the diligent work of the ATF/NYPD Joint Firearms Task Force, their criminal exploits have been brought to an end, stated ATF Special Agent-in-Charge DeVito. I would like to thank the United States Attorneys Office for their work in prosecuting this case and acknowledge the contributions of the New Hampshire State Police, Maine State Police, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, Waterville Maine Police Department and the Augusta Maine Police Department.

The NYPDs responsibility to prevent crime and keep people safe knows no boundaries. In this case, our hardworking detectives and law enforcement partners dismantled an alleged drug gang with a complex distribution network that crossed state lines and penetrated Rikers Island, stated NYPD Commissioner Shea.

Contraband smuggling at Rikers Island continues to be a threat to the security of our Citys jails and an active area of investigation for DOI. These defendants allegedly worked in concert using various methods to smuggle illicit drugs into Rikers Island, including mailing packages of paper soaked with K2 disguised as mail to inmates in an attempt to bypass Department of Correction screening procedures. DOI is proud to partner with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, New York Field Division, and the New York City Police Department to investigate and prosecute these alleged crimes, stated DOI Commissioner Garnett.

According to the complaints, Ayers, Clarke, Govan, Huard, Jessica Pelkey, Walton and Demetrius Wright are members of a drug ring operating in New York, Maine and elsewhere. The organization trafficked cocaine base (or crack), heroin and other controlled substances using vehicles with hidden compartments and trap houses in Maine to store and sell narcotics.

As alleged, the drug trafficking proceeds were deposited into various bank accounts, including an account controlled by Sonnenblick, who is employed as a paraprofessional by the New York City Department of Education, as is Clarke. Sonnenblick then transferred the drug money to her co-conspirators. In addition to laundering proceeds through bank deposits and wire transfers, drug proceeds were also laundered through the acquisition of vehicles, including a Range Rover purchased by Sonnenblick and used by Ayers.

As charged in the related complaint, Moeleek Harrell, the founder of the Bully gang and currently an inmate at Rikers Island, coordinated with associates Kennedy and Harris to smuggle 5-Fluoro MDMB-Pica, a Schedule I controlled substance commonly referred to as K2, into the jail. Law enforcement officers recovered multiple pages of a court transcript that had been soaked in K2 and earmarked for delivery to Harrell. A subsequent search of Harrells cell revealed additional pages of paper from comic books that field tested positive for synthetic cannabinoid and for fentanyl and/or heroin.

Ayers, Clarke, Govan, Huard, Pelkey, Walton and Wright are charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin and at least 280 grams of crack cocaine; Ayers and Clarke are charged with possessing one or more firearms in relation to the drug conspiracy; Ayers, Clarke, Govan, Sonnenblick and Walton are charged with money laundering conspiracy; and Harrell, Harris and Kennedy are charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute K2.

During searches of premises today in Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, law enforcement officials found multiple firearms; a substantial amount of U.S. currency; drug manufacturing and packaging supplies; law enforcement paperwork pertaining to criminal investigations and narcotics believed to include marijuana, crack cocaine, heroin and fentanyl.

The charges in the complaints are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The governments case is being handled by the Offices Organized Crime and Gangs Section and Public Integrity Section. Assistant United States Attorneys Drew G. Rolle, Nicholas J. Moscow and Special Assistant United States Attorney Virginia T. Nguyen are in charge of the prosecution.

529,"(Yicai Global) Oct. 12 -- Luckin Coffee and four companies embroiled in the Chinese coffeehouse chains multi-million dollar bookkeeping fraudalso fabricated millions of orders.

They overstated orders by 123 million and were involved in false advertising, Chinas markets regulator said today as it published details of more breaches by Luckin and the four others. Last month, it slapped a CNY61 million (USD9.1 million) fine on Xiamen-based Luckin and more than 40 other firms.

Luckin Coffee China and its Beijing branch, with the assistance of firms including Beijing Auto World Consulting Service, Beijing Shenzhou Youtong Technology Development and Zhengzhe International Trade Xiamen, inflated sales revenue, costs, and profit margin figures from April to December last year to gain an unfair advantage, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in its statement.

Luckin used click farming on individual and corporate purchase orders and corporate customer transaction fraud to exaggerate revenue and collectively fabricated orders, with coffee coupons, via sham deals, forged bank statements, setting up fake databases and falsifying consumption records.

The company violated Chinas Unfair Competition Law and constituted false advertising, according to the regulator, which also fined the five firms CNY2 million (USD296,386) each. The law allows a penalty of between CNY1 million and CNY2 million for cases of serious false advertising.

On April 2, Luckin announced that Chief Operating Officer Liu Jian had committed financial fraud, involving CNY2.2 billion (USD325.9 million) of transactions a month. In the same month, the market regulator set up a task force to investigate.

The fraud led to multiple lawsuits against Luckin, which ceased trading on the Nasdaq on June 29, a little over 400 days after it went public. At the start of the listing, Luckin Coffee [NASDAQ: LK] was trading at USD17. They ended at USD1.38, with an overall market capitalization of just USD347 million.",am
530,"MILAN: A Milan judge has seized 2.3 million euros (US$2.7 million) from pharmaceutical multinational Novartis as part of a fraud investigation, a document seen by Reuters shows.

The money has been sequestered from the company's Italian unit Novartis Farma SpA, suspected of selling medicines to hospitals at inflated prices as part of a scheme to fraudulently obtain reimbursement funds from the regional government.

Novartis said in a statement it rejected the ""groundless"" accusations of the Milan prosecutors and had behaved with full transparency.

Finance police conducting the investigation say that nine private hospitals in Milan took part in the scheme between 2013 and 2018, hurting the finances of the Lombardy region around Italy's financial capital.

According to the seizure decree, seen by Reuters, the hospitals were reimbursed in full by the region, omitting to declare that the real price they paid was lower thanks to credit notes issued to them by the pharmaceutical companies.

The San Donato group, the company that runs the hospitals, already paid 10.2 million euros in damages to the Lombardy authorities in December last year.

The group, contacted by Reuters, did not comment.

Novartis said it was not aware of the economic or accounting arrangements in place between the hospitals it sells pharmaceuticals to and the regional governments they deal with.

Mylan Italia, the Italian unit of multinational pharmaceutical group Mylan , is also among the companies involved in the investigation, the document shows.

The company has filed a plea bargain proposal for a fine of 200,000 euros and a confiscation of 1.2 million euros, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.

The request has received a green light from the public prosecutor's office and it will now be up to a judge to decide whether to accept it, the source added.

531,"Reporting from Sao Paulo, Brazil 

Police arrested the heads of Brazils two largest construction companies Friday, as an investigation into a multibillion-dollar corruption scheme involving state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which has rocked the government and economy since last year, pushes further toward the top of the countrys corporate world.

Marcelo Odebrecht and Otávio Marques, presidents of the Odebrecht and Andrade Gutierrez construction companies, were taken into custody Friday morning, and federal police announced that a total of 21 arrest warrants have been issued for employees of the two companies. Authorities are investigating corruption, embezzlement of public finances, money laundering, and racketeering, they said.

In a note, Odebrecht said the company considers these warrants unnecessary, since the company and its executives have always cooperated fully with authorities in the investigations. Odebrecht is the largest construction company in Latin America, and has activities around the world.

The so-called Car Wash investigation has slowly outlined the contours of a vast scheme in which billions of dollars were allegedly diverted from Petrobras to large construction firms, which then passed on payments to political parties.

As the probe expanded this year, President Dilma Rousseffs approval ratings have dropped to record lows and growth has stalled, partially as a result of damage done to the energy sector. Over the same period, critics have at times lavished praised on federal police for taking on Brazils top most powerful economic and political players, something rarely seen here.

In April, police arrested Joao Vaccari Neto, treasurer of Rousseffs Workers Party, which has been in power for more than a decade.

Odebrecht and Marques were fully in charge of everything going out at the companies, said federal police officer Igor Romário at a press conference Friday. Concrete evidence has been discovered  and not just testimony, but documents  proving that they participated in negotiations that led to the formation of a cartel.",am

The police arrested the mastermind of many cases of cyber fraud in Manali yesterday. Kullu SP Gaurav Singh said Sourav Mitra (30), a resident of Nadia district in West Bengal, was arrested for a cyber crime of bulk message fraud and a case was registered against him at Manali police station.

The SP said that a delivery boy of Amazon had filed a police complaint that Mitra came to their Manali office and told him that he had ordered a laptop online with the option of cash on delivery. He expressed desire to transfer Rs 30,000 through net banking as he did not have cash. The delivery boy gave him the details of his own bank account number as at that time no bank account number of the company was available. Later, the delivery boy received a message on his cellphone that Rs 30,000 had been transferred to his bank account.

The SP said the delivery boy gave Mitra the laptop but later in the evening he discovered that he did not receive the money in his bank account. He visited the bank and found that no money had been transferred. He tried to call the accused who had blocked his phone number. He then realised that he had been cheated.

Gaurav said that the cyber police found that the message that was sent to the delivery boy was fake. He added that the police apprehended the accused in Manali, who told his name as Arvind and also presented an Aadhaar card. Upon a thorough search of his house in Manali, his real credentials were discovered, the SP added.

The SP said that during interrogation, Sourav disclosed that he had duped a boy of Rs 8 lakh in Bihar and another person in Gaya. He had cheated many persons in Shimla and Kinnaur by falsely presenting himself as an employee of Discovery TV channel.

533,"SINGAPORE: A woman who was ""blinded by love"" helped her student care centre boss cheat the Government of student fee subsidies, and lied to help him obtain financial assistance for his mother.

Daljit Kaur Yinder Singh, 50, was jailed for four months on Wednesday (Oct 14) for her crimes.

She pleaded guilty to three charges of making false entries with intent to defraud the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), engaging in a conspiracy to give false information to MSF, and abetting her co-accused to cheat MSF. Another two charges were taken into consideration.

The court heard that Daljit was a centre supervisor at Welcare Student Care Centre from 2002 to June 2015, working under co-accused Gerard Michael, who owned the centre. She supervised the children and liaised with parents on the government-funded Student Care Fee Assistance scheme.

Student care centres under the scheme must submit withdrawal forms to MSF if parents withdraw their children from the centre, so the ministry would stop the disbursement and collect any refunds for excess funds.

Michael instructed Daljit not to submit forms for children who withdrew, and also told her to make false entries in attendance books and prepare supporting documents so it appeared as if the children were still attending the centre.

She did not inform MSF of the withdrawals of 12 children, and MSF disbursed excess subsidies of S$13,630 to Welcare between January 2015 and May 2015.

The centre made a total of S$48,280 in illegal claims between 2014 and 2016. Of this, S$29,410 of losses caused to MSF was from Daljit's conspiracy with Michael. Welcare has returned S$28,762 to MSF, and S$19,518 remains outstanding.

SHE LIED TO HELP HIS MOTHER OBTAIN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

Separately, Michael also instructed Daljit to apply for ComCare for his mother in January 2015. ComCare is a government financial assistance scheme for needy households.

Acting on Michael's instructions, Daljit went to a social services office in Ang Mo Kio with Michael's mother and lied to the officer that his mother was jobless and did not have financial support from her children.

MSF approved the application and helped Michael's mother pay for rental and conservancy charges for six months. It also credited S$340 per month into her bank account and gave her a medical assistance card.

Daljit's lawyer said his client has indicated that she is willing to be a prosecution witness against Michael in his trial, and said she was ""a mere pawn"" used by him. The offences were committed at a low point in her life when she was ""blinded by love"" for Michael, said the lawyer.

The judge agreed that Daljit was not the mastermind, but said she should not have complied with the instructions given.",am
534,"The Supreme Court Friday agreed to hear an appeal challenging a Delhi HC order in 2015 which acquitted the Hinduja brothers in the Bofors scam case. (File)

The CBI on Friday filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging a 2005 order of the Delhi High Court quashing all charges against accused persons in the politically sensitive Bofors pay-off case. The filing of the appeal assumes significance as Attorney General K K Venugopal had recently advised the agency against moving a petition against the high court verdict after a delay of 12 years.

What is the Bofors scam?

On March 18, 1986, India signed a Rs 1,437-crore deal with Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors for the supply of 400 155 mm Howitzer guns for the Army. A year later, on April 16, 1987, a Swedish radio channel alleged that the company had bribed top Indian politicians and defence personnel to secure the contract. The scandal rocked the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in the late 1980s. On January 22, 1990, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lodged an FIR against the then president of Bofors Martin Ardbo, the alleged middleman Win Chadda and the Hinduja brothers for criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.

It was alleged that certain public servants and private persons in India and abroad had entered into a criminal conspiracy between 1982 and 1987 in pursuance of which the offences of bribery, corruption, cheating and forgery were committed.

The first charge sheet in the case was filed on October 22, 1999, against Chadda, Ottavio Quattrocchi, the then defence secretary S K Bhatnagar, Ardbo and the Bofors company. A supplementary charge sheet was filed against the Hinduja brothers on October 9, 2000.

According to the criminal complaint, Sozi used the names and identities of various individuals to open credit accounts, rent cars and make large purchases. It is alleged that Sozi, along with a female accomplice, opened credit accounts at an office supply retailer under various fake identities and then used these accounts to purchase Visa gift cards, resulting in a loss to the retail chain of more than $100,000. He processed these accounts via an employee of the office retailer who was complicit in the scheme. Sozi also allegedly used stolen identities to: purchase a Rolex for more than $15,000; rent a Ford Mustang convertible from Logan Airport, which he then failed to return; and rent a Dodge Charger from Logan Airport, which he then failed to return.

Sozi also allegedly possessed a Maine drivers license, bearing his photograph and the name of an identity theft victim, which was used to open a bank account and to make large purchases at the Apple Store.

The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Jensen, 59, who will also step down as deputy of Denmarks governing Social Democratic Party, has served as Lord Mayor of Copenhagen since 2010.

His resignation was welcomed by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, calling it the right decision in a Facebook post.

It is obvious that we in the Social Democratic Party have problems, and that needs to change now, she told local news agency Ritzau earlier on Monday.

Jensens exit came after two women, one of them employed by the Social Democrats, described being sexually harassed by Jensen in 2012 and 2017, in remarks published on Friday by daily Jyllands-Posten. They said both incidents were at social events and involved Jensen touching the women against their will.

Jensen said on Facebook he had been part of a harmful and old culture in the Social Democratic Party. I would like to apologise to the women I have offended, Jensen told a news conference on Monday.

A series of sexual harassment cases in Denmark have come to light in recent months as more women within politics, the movie industry and the media have come forward to describe incidents involving male colleagues and superiors.

537,"PORTLAND, Ore.Two former Jacksonville, Oregon residents were sentenced today in federal court for their roles in a conspiracy to traffic marijuana grown in Southern Oregon to Georgia, Illinois, and North Carolina, and launder the proceeds.

Alex David Koplin, 34, was sentenced to 31 months in federal prison and three years supervised release and Tina Marie Waterfield, 38, was sentenced to 5 years of probation.

According to court documents, in approximately 2011, Koplin moved from Georgia to Oregon to work in the marijuana industry. Within a few years, he purchased property in Jackson County, Oregon and started a marijuana farm. Koplin worked with other marijuana growers to combine harvests, broker sales, and transport marijuana from Oregon to other states. Between November 2014 and June 2016, Koplin coordinated the sale and interstate transport of approximately 260 kilograms of marijuana.

While investigating the interstate trafficking conspiracy, authorities discovered Waterfield, Koplins then-girlfriend, was receiving thousands of dollars in out-of-state payments to her PayPal account. Investigators later learned that Waterfield unlawfully manufactured, sold, and shipped marijuana edibles to East Coast customers and laundered the proceeds in an attempt to conceal their source. Between 2013 and 2016, Waterfields bank accounts showed approximately $494,000 in unexplained deposits.

In April 2017, investigators executed a federal search warrant on Koplin and Waterfields residence and seized marijuana plants; unprocessed cut marijuana; butane honey oil, a cannabis extract; and $44,226 in U.S. currency.

On August 19, 2019, both defendants pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Koplin also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.

As part of his plea agreement, Koplin agreed to pay $150,000 to satisfy a forfeiture money judgment. Waterfield agreed to forfeit the $44,226 in U.S. currency seized from the residence she shared with Koplin.

This case was investigated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and Medford Police Department. It was prosecuted by Steven T. Mygrant and Julia E. Jarrett, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.

This case was brought as part of the Justice Departments Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, the centerpiece of the departments strategy for reducing the availability of drugs in the U.S. OCDETF was established in 1982 to mount a comprehensive attack on drug trafficking by disrupting and dismantling major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations.

In the intervening decade Barclays  and the world  have moved on.

The British lender and its former employees, including ex-chief executive John Varley and former senior bankers Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath, will now present their case, starting with a hearing on July 3. Individuals could face prison if found guilty. Barclays itself could end up with fines along the lines of those that retailer Tesco and engine maker Rolls-Royce agreed with the SFO earlier this year.

The stain on the banks history apart, the main impact on Barclays is the potential financial cost, and a drain on current Chief Executive Jes Staleys time. Aside from any fines that may result from the SFOs action, the lender faces potential civil cases including a $1 billion suit from financier Amanda Staveley, and an unfair dismissal case from Boath. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice, and Britains Financial Conduct Authority, are also still investigating.

Though its important that justice is seen to be done, authorities are edging towards answering questions nobody is asking anymore. Barclays has had three chief executives since Varley, and has conducted a wide-ranging review of its culture. Investors and regulators probably fret more about present risks, like whether Barclays can pass U.S. stress tests, or how to field Staleys clumsy misfires, such as his attempt to unmask a whistleblower.

The verdict also wont change the fact that Barclays has benefited from avoiding an injection of UK government capital in 2008. Since then, the banks shares have delivered investors a total return of more than 70 percent, compared with around 20 percent for the part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group and heavy losses for investors in Royal Bank of Scotland, which still labours under state control. The SFO may be closing a chapter in financial history, but investors are already onto the next volume.",am
539,"The US Department of Justice has fined HSBCs Swiss division $192 million for avoiding tax. As the non-bank market makers take the top slots, banks now need to dump their ailing business units and step up to maintain their positions

The last thing the Tier 1 FX interbank dealers need right now is more large penalties for transgressions.

Over the past five years, the largest institutions which handle over half of the worlds FX order flow at Tier 1 level have been subjected to regulatory fines, massive penalties for fixing FX benchmarks and lengthy litigation over alleged rigging of the soon to be defunct LIBOR.

Dubious tactics such as illicit inside discussions on messaging terminals between traders, whilst the banks use their legacy single dealer platforms to conduct last look execution on their liquidity takers as they show them disdain by making the prime brokerage market very constrained by refusing to offer counterparty credit unless a $50 million balance sheet can be displayed has led to these banks slipping down the market share table and being given over to non-bank market makers such as XTX Markets which is now the number one FX dealer in the world.

Today, HSBC, the worlds largest FX dealer by market share, has been handed a $192 million fine by the US Department of Justice for the avoidance of tax by its Swiss division.

The US Department of Justice filed a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), but agreed to drop the charges in three years if the bank abides by the terms of the deal, according to court documents.

The US Department of Justice filed a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), but agreed to drop the charges in three years if the bank abides by the terms of the deal, according to court documents.

The department said HSBC Private Bank bankers would travel to US cities including Miami to scout for clients.

The HSBC deal is the latest in a string of cases involving Swiss-based banks. Lenders including UBS and Credit Suisse have paid out billions of dollars after conspiring to help rich Americans dodge taxes.

The tough stance taken by US authorities over the last decade has helped pressure Switzerland to end the banking secrecy that had allowed offshore clients to hide money in Swiss accounts.

The Swiss government now has deals with many counties to provide information about accounts held by foreigners in the country.

Some HSBC Private Bank bankers continued cross-border business with US clients even as authorities began investigating Swiss banks for tax-dodging schemes, the Department of Justice said.

Some HSBC Switzerland bankers assisted clients in closing their accounts in a manner that continued to conceal their offshore assets, said US prosecutors.

In 2009, UBS agreed to pay $780m in fines, penalties, interest and restitution for helping wealthy Americas conceal assets from US tax authorities. Credit Suisse paid $2.6bn in a similar deal in 2014.

Today the Swiss subsidiary operates under new management, chief executive Alex Classen said in a statement.

We have strengthened our compliance function, enhanced our control framework and put in place a comprehensive client tax transparency policy.

HSBC paid 300m in 2017 to settle a separate tax evasion investigation by French authorities after a former employee leaked client data that triggered investigations in several countries.

Banks such as HSBC are increasingly concentrating on their core business of interbank dealing, as it is the most revenue generating and least resource consuming activity that they conduct.

As the non-bank market makers gradually take over the stronghold that has been maintained by the Canary Wharf-based dealing divisions of British, American, French, Swiss and German giants, perhaps banks should look at their corporate structure so that their institutionalised legacy does not become completely eroded by the well-oiled and slick non-bank rivals that are totally aligned with our industry and have a clean copybook.",am
540,"Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Mr. Floyds death.

MINNEAPOLIS  The white police officer charged with murder in the killing two weeks ago of George Floyd, a black man whose death in custody led to nationwide protests, was given a bail of as much as $1.25 million on Monday.

Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran, participated in his initial hearing at the heavily fortified Hennepin County courthouse on a video feed from jail. Mr. Chauvin, who has been behind bars since he was arrested on May 29, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder, a more serious count than he had originally faced. He could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison.

Mr. Chauvin, who placed his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd for nearly nine minutes in a video that prompted anguish and outrage across the nation, has been a focus of anger, referred to as the most hated man in the world. Activists said they feared he would not abide by bail restrictions if he was permitted to go home until trial.

Arguing for a bail of $1.25 million, the prosecutor Matthew Frank said Mr. Floyds death had created a strong reaction in the community, to put it mildly. He said that created two factors in deciding bail.

One is the likelihood to flee from the jurisdiction because of not only the severity of the charges, but the strength of the communitys opinion, he said. And secondly, because of the severity of those charges, a significant amount of bail is warranted.

During the hearing, Mr. Chauvin wore an orange jumpsuit and a blue mask that muffled his responses of Yes, your honor to a few procedural questions. Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvins lawyer, said he did not object to the states bail request at this time; Judge Jeannice M. Reding granted it.

Mr. Chauvins bail would be $1 million if he agrees to certain conditions, including surrendering any of his firearms, remaining in the state until trial, not working in law enforcement and avoiding any contact with the Floyd family.

His next court appearance is scheduled for June 29, when he will enter a plea and some of the states evidence could be laid out.

Mr. Chauvins bail is higher than the bail of at least $750,000 given last week to the other three officers accused of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyds death. Lawyers for two of those men, both rookies who had just days on the job, blamed Mr. Chauvin, who was a training officer for both of them. The third former officer has cooperated with the authorities. Those are all indications that the police officers will not be presenting a united front, unusual in cases in which the police are charged in a death.

All four men were fired the day after Mr. Floyd died.

On that evening of May 25, an employee of a corner store in south Minneapolis called the police, reporting that a counterfeit $20 bill had been used to buy cigarettes. The two rookie officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane  who between them had seven days on the job  responded first.

Mr. Floyd, sitting in a nearby car, stiffened when the officers tried to put him in the back of their police car, and fell to the ground, according to an arrest affidavit. Mr. Floyd told the officers that he was not resisting arrest but was claustrophobic and did not want to get in the back seat of the car.

Then Mr. Chauvin and his partner, Tou Thao, arrived. Mr. Floyd struggled, and began saying he could not breathe, the affidavit says. Mr. Chauvin pulled Mr. Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car at 8:19 p.m. Still handcuffed, Mr. Floyd went to the ground.

The rookie officers held Mr. Floyds back and legs. As Mr. Chauvin held his left knee on Mr. Floyds neck over almost nine minutes, Mr. Floyd said I cant breathe and Mama and then, after a time, nothing at all.

The protests started the next day in Minneapolis before spreading to the world. Although some have turned into violent clashes with the police, and arsons and looting were reported in the early days in some protests, demonstrations were largely calm in recent days.

It is a temporary peace, activists cautioned, if Mr. Chauvin is not convicted.

There is a real significant discrepancy between what happens when a policeman does something and a black man does something, said one protester, Sara Semi, who just got #icantbreathe tattooed on her neck. Chauvin needs to get life in prison if we want to see justice.

Mr. Nelson, Mr. Chauvins lawyer, declined to comment when contacted by The New York Times.

Since the protests, Minneapolis has made changes. The University of Minnesota, the city school board and the parks department have cut ties with the police. On Sunday, a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to dismantle the citys Police Department and create a new system of public safety in a city where the police have long been accused of racism.

In addition, Mr. Chauvins wife of almost 10 years has filed for divorce. They separated three days after Mr. Floyds killing.

Mr. Chauvin, who is 44, did not always want to be a police officer. He studied food preparation at a technical college, taking classes like pantry food preparation, job seeking skills and stocks, sauces and soups, according to his personnel file with the Minneapolis Police Department. He worked as a cook at McDonalds and made ribs and chicken at Tinuccis Restaurant. Then he switched paths, becoming a military police officer in the U.S. Army, serving in Germany.

At the Police Department, his record was mixed. Mr. Chauvin appears to have been reprimanded  and possibly suspended  after a woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, his personnel file showed. She told the authorities that he searched her and put her in the back of a squad car for driving 10 miles an hour over the speed limit.

Mr. Chauvin was also the subject of at least 16 other misconduct complaints over two decades. His personnel file, heavily redacted, included no details on these.

But he was also given at least two medals of valor. One was for his role in fatally shooting someone who was pointing a sawed-off shotgun at officers in 2006, the records said. The second was for a domestic-violence call in 2008. Mr. Chauvin broke down a bathroom door; after a struggle, he twice shot the person being sought, his file said.

Mr. Chauvin was awarded two medals of commendation. In 2008, he was recognized for apprehending a man accused of pointing a gun at a man and a woman  Mr. Chauvin and his partner followed the man with a gun, eventually tackling the man, who dropped a loaded .357.

His second was for working off-duty as security in November 2008 outside El Nuevo Rodeo. After he saw a man in an altercation fire off two rounds, Mr. Chauvin arrested him, the records showed. He also arrested some of the mans friends, the records said, all of whom were accused of being part of a street gang.

That club may have been Mr. Chauvins only earlier connection to Mr. Floyd, who had also worked security at El Nuevo Rodeo for much of the year before their fatal encounter. It was uncertain whether they knew each other.

541,"(Yicai Global) June 3 -- GSX Techedu alleges that Grizzly Research fabricated data in a second report the activist short selling firm published about the Chinese online tutoring services provider, describing it as breaking the bottom line of business ethics, The Paper reported today.

GSX claims that the research report was awash with photoshopped images and unsubstantiated statements, The Paper said, citing the company. It added that the Beijing-based firm plans to seek help from Chinas public security bureaus economic crimes investigation unit.

GSX exaggerated its student numbers and operating revenue by around 900 percent and is also doing large-scale illegal marketing, Grizzly Research claimed in its report published yesterday. Actual student numbers in each class and revenue are available via the application program interface, or API, of its Gaotu 100, and its income calculated based on the actual number of students is far less than the figure in its financial report, the report said.

The API cannot reveal the complete data, and courses seen on the API are just those for sale at the moment, not including major courses in spring, GSX said, adding that the reports forecast on its revenue from Gaotu 100 in the second quarter was groundless.

A large amount of information tampering, digitally altered pictures and completely illogical allegations appeared in the report, GSX said. For example, the picture on the bottom left of page 16 shows that the birthdays of the 39 people listed are almost the same.

Many institutions have gone short on GSX this year. US-based Grizzly Research went short on the stock [NYSE: GSX] in February, saying the company had substantially overstated its profitability when applying to go public.

Since April, Citron Research has released three short-selling reports alleging that GSX had many fake accounts and undisclosed related transactions. But the firms shares gained 4.8 percent over the previous trading day after Citron Research issued its third report on May 7.

Muddy Waters Capital, a well-known short-selling agency that exposed Luckin Coffees financial fraud, also released a report on GSX on May 18, saying that some 80 percent of its users are bots.",am

Former finance professor and Macquarie Bank executive Dr Tony Castagna is behind bars after a Supreme Court jury found him guilty of tax evasion, money laundering and dealing with the proceeds of crime.

Castagna, 70, is facing a maximum jail term of 25 years after the jury found that over a nine-year period up until 2008 he deliberately and dishonestly concealed from the Australian Tax Office millions of dollars in fees and bonuses he received while working as a consultant to Macquarie Bank.

Also found guilty was Castagnas cousin Robert Agius, a former accountant in the tax haven of Vanuatu, who conspired with Castagna to conceal the money.

Agius, who grew up in the same household as Castagna, is already serving a non-parole period of six years and eight months jail, after being found guilty in 2012 for operating unrelated tax avoidance schemes via his Vanuatu-based accountancy firm.

The jury heard that on May 21, 2008, the AFP executed search warrants at Castagnas home in Gordon, on Sydneys north shore, as well as at his Macquarie Bank office.

This followed raids by the AFP, in conjunction with Vanuatu police, on the Port Vila home and office of then Vanuatu-based accountant Agius.

The AFP had been intercepting Agiuss phone prior to his arrest in April 2008. Intercepted calls played to the jury revealed the pairs reluctance to discuss their financial dealings over the phone. In one call Castagna was heard suggesting Agius use Lizs cell phone.

Agius and Castagna were also found guilty of money laundering in that they conspired to deal with property knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The Crown case was that $4.5 million of Castagnas money hidden offshore was channeled back to Australia so that he could buy investment properties in the Newcastle area.

To avoid tax, the jury heard the money was returned to Castagna by way of sham loans from Agius.

Apart from facing the possible confiscation of his property under proceeds of crime legislation, the ATO is also pursuing Castanga for unpaid taxes and penalties in excess of $10 million.

Castagna is understood to have shares worth $26 million, held via offshore entity Blackall Ltd, in cyber security company Nuix, which is majority-owned by Macquarie Bank.

Castagna is currently a director of Nuix, which helps protect the cyber secrets of and detect financial crimes for their clients which include the Serious Fraud Office in Britain, US Department of Homeland Security, the Australian Defence Force and ASIC.

Two of Nuixs major clients are the Australian Federal Police and the ATO. It was through the efforts of these two government agencies tax-avoidance probe Project Wickenby that Castagna now faces a maximum of ten years for defrauding the ATO and 25 years for money laundering.

Justice Christine Adamson refused bail for Castagna ahead of his sentencing hearing on 25 May.

A former Mexican security minister has been arrested in the US, charged with taking bribes from a drugs cartel.

Genaro García Luna is accused of allowing the Sinaloa cartel of ""El Chapo"" Guzman to operate in Mexico in exchange for millions of dollars.

Prosecutors say Mr García Luna gave the cartel safe passage for drug shipments and access to sensitive information.

They say that on two occasions cartel members delivered up to $5m (£3.7m) in two briefcases to him in person.

He has previously denied any wrongdoing.

Mr García Luna, 52, served as public security chief in the administration of President Felipe Calderon between 2006 and 2012.

His arrest in Texas is a major development in Mexican politics, the BBC's Mexico correspondent Will Grant reports.

Mr García Luna was not just an important figure in Mr Calderon's administration - he was Mexico's secretary of public security, the face of the country's federal police force, our correspondent adds.

Mr Calderon, with US backing, deployed troops against the cartels for the first time. Tens of thousands died in Mexico in drug-related violence during his ""war on drugs"".

Mr García Luna was taken into custody in Dallas, Texas, on Monday, prosecutors in New York said.

Court documents unsealed on Tuesday in Brooklyn showed he had been charged with cocaine trafficking conspiracy and making false statements.

""García Luna stands accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from 'El Chapo' Guzman's Sinaloa cartel while he controlled Mexico's Federal Police Force and was responsible for ensuring public safety in Mexico,"" said US Attorney Richard Donoghue, announcing the arrest.

He was also accused of lying about his criminal past when he applied for US naturalisation in 2018.

Guzmán was jailed for life in July following a three-month trial in the US.

During that trial, ex-cartel member Jesus ""Rey"" Zambada alleged that he had personally delivered two suitcases containing millions of dollars in bribes to Mr García Luna at a restaurant.

Mr García Luna denied those allegations at the time, calling them ""lies, defamation and perjury"".

US prosecutors allege that the former minister used his position to protect the Sinaloa cartel's trafficking operations from 2001 to 2012, enabling it to operate ""with impunity"" in Mexico.

If found guilty, he faces between 10 years to life in prison.",am
544,"ATHENS, Greece -- Russian cybercrime suspect Alexander Vinnik, who is wanted in the United States on charges of laundering billions of dollars' worth of the virtual currency bitcoin, appeared Wednesday before Greece's Supreme Court for a hearing into his extradition to the U.S.

Vinnik is the subject of a judicial tug-of-war between the U.S. and Russia, which is also seeking his extradition on lesser charges.

The U.S. is accusing Vinnik of laundering $4 billion worth of bitcoins through BTC-e, one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges, which he allegedly operated.

Russia, meanwhile, wants him back to face charges related to a 667,000-ruble ($11,500) fraud.

Lower courts in Greece have approved both extradition requests. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in coming days. If it decides in favor of extradition to the U.S., Greece's justice minister will have the final word on where the suspect will be sent.

Vinnik, who denies any involvement in bitcoin fraud, is fighting his extradition to the United States, but not to Russia.

The 37-year-old was arrested on a U.S. request in July while on holiday with his family in the Halkidiki area of northern Greece, which is popular with Russian tourists.

The U.S. Justice Department says Vinnik has been indicted by a grand jury in the Northern District of California on charges including money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions. The charges carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison.",am
545,"Lamine Diack, the disgraced former IAAF president, has been ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering. It follows a four-year investigation in France into doping cover-ups, extortion and bribe-taking in world athletics.

The 86-year-old, who led the International Association of Athletics Federations from 1999-2015 and was one of the most influential men in global sport, is accused of being part of a conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for money. This conspiracy also involved the Russian athletics chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, Russias former national middle distance coach Alexei Melnikov, Diacks former aide Habib Cissé and the IAAFs former head of anti-doping, Gabriel Dollé. These four will also face trial on the same charges, along with Diacks son, Papa Massata Diack, the disgraced former IAAF marketing executive who was banned for life from athletics in 2016. They all deny the charges.

All six will be tried for their role in the case of Liliya Shobukhova, the London Marathon winner in 2010, who paid $600,000 in exchange for covering up violations in her athlete biological passport thus allowing her to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games.

According to the prosecutors, Diack and his son, who oversees a sports consulting business called Black Tidings, solicited payments from athletes, either directly or indirectly, totalling 3.45m in exchange for covering up positive doping tests and allowing athletes to go on competing.

Massata Diack has also emerged as a central figure in French judicial probes of suspected corruption involving the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games and other sports events. The judicial official says the younger Diack will stand trial for complicity in corruption and money laundering. Believed to be living in Senegal, he could be tried in absentia.

The French authorities have also been investigating allegations Diack Sr received bribes for his votes in several bidding contests for high-profile sports events. The former International Olympic Committee member is claimed to have controlled the votes of several African colleagues.

It is alleged that Diack Sr, a former mayor of Senegals capital Dakar, used these payments to fund political campaigns in his homeland, as well as a lavish lifestyle in Monaco, where the IAAF is based.",am
546,"The Vatican Bank scandal is spreading.

Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, a former top Vatican accountant now on trial for an alleged plot to smuggle 20 million euros from Switzerland into Italy, was further charged on Tuesday with laundering millions through the Vatican bank, his lawyer said.

Scarano has been under house arrest in his native Salerno in southern Italy as part of the money smuggling trial that began on Dec. 3. The new charge pertains to suspected laundering via his accounts at the Vatican bank, lawyer Silverio Sica told Reuters.

The new charge comes just days after Pope Francis sacked nearly all the cardinals from the commission charged with overseeing the scandal-hit Vatican Bank.

Scarano is on trial on charges of conspiring to smuggle some 20 million euros, or $27 million, out of Switzerland for rich shipbuilder friends in Salerno, near Naples.

Police said Scarano and two other people served with arrest warrants on Tuesday were suspected of laundering and making false statements. Sica said one of the arrested was a priest friend of Scarano, who was suspended from his job at the Vatican last year.

A police statement said millions of euros in ""false donations"" from offshore companies moved through Scarano's accounts at the Vatican bank, formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion.

They said millions of euros worth of bank accounts and real estate holdings were in the process of being confiscated as part of the police operation in Salerno that coincided with the issuing of the arrest warrants.",am
547,"KANSAS CITY, Mo.  A Sedalia, Missouri, man has been indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion.

Duane Dixon, 57, was charged in a two-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Kansas City, Missouri, on Wednesday, Jan. 29. Dixon was arrested today when he self-surrendered to federal authorities.

The federal indictment charges Dixon with one count of tax evasion and one count of obstructing the administration of tax laws.

Dixon allegedly failed to file timely tax returns for the years 1996 through 2010, and did not make any voluntary payment toward his taxes for those years. Dixon is specifically charged in the indictment with evading taxes for the calendar years 2005 through 2010, for which the IRS assessed Dixons tax due and owing in the total amount of $639,333.

Dixon hired a return preparer to prepare tax returns for the 2005 to 2010 tax years, the indictment says, but provided the preparer with false and incomplete information. Knowing that these returns omitted significant income, Dixon submitted the returns to the IRS.

Dixon formed Dixon Builders, LLC, on Feb. 28, 2012. Dixon then opened bank accounts, bought and sold real estate, and purchased a boat and vehicles in the LLCs name, according to the indictment. During the 2013 and 2014 tax years, for example, Dixon purchased nine pieces of real estate outright in the name of Dixon Builders LLC. Dixon allegedly concealed assets by transferring several properties from Dixon Builders, LLC, to his adult children.

Dixon allegedly told an IRS revenue officer, who was attempting to collect payments from him, that he had no personal or business bank accounts, that he had no business such as an LLC, that he was self-employed as a handyman and had no employees, and that he did not own any rental homes or have any rentals in a business or other persons name. Dixon allegedly knew these statements were false at the time he made them.

According to the indictment, Dixon filed bankruptcies at times when the IRS was attempting to assess or collect his taxes, to forestall levies and seizures of his property. Dixon failed to provide information or make payments, however, resulting in dismissals of cases by the bankruptcy court.

The charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.",am
548,"The founders of Backpage.com, the notorious website best known for hosting sex and prostitution-related classified advertisements, have been indicted with five other people on federal charges, the Justice Department announced Monday.

The 93-count indictment accused website founders Michael Lacey, 69, and James Larkin, 68, of facilitating prostitution and money laundering.

Executive vice president Scott Spear, 67, was charged with facilitating prostitution and money laundering, while chief financial officer John Brunst, 66, was charged with money laundering.

Sales and marketing director Dan Hyer, 49, operations manager Andrew Padilla, 45, and assistant operations manager Joye Vaught, 37, also were charged with facilitating prostitution. The indictment alleged that Padilla threatened to fire any employee who acknowledged in writing that the escorts depicted in ads were actually prostitutes.

The seven people charged in the federal indictment were accused of trying to sanitize ads by removing photos and words that indicated prostitution -- before publishing revised versions of the notices. The company also allegedly laundered money by wiring ad proceeds into foreign bank accounts.

In addition to the indictments, the Justice Department confirmed that it had seized Backpage.com and affiliated websites on Friday.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions described Backpage.com as ""the dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike.""

He added, ""But this illegality stops right now.""

Backpage.com let users create posts to advertise items for sale, seek roommates, participate in forums, promote upcoming events or post job openings. But the site also included listings for adult escorts and other sexual services, and authorities said advertising related to those services had proved extremely lucrative.

Last year, the website's chief executive Carl Ferrer, along with Lacey and Larkin, pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges in California, where state prosecutors said the website operators had illegally funneled money through multiple companies and created various websites to get around banks that refused to process transactions.

The California state attorney general's office also had moved to file pimping, conspiracy and other charges against the Backpage.com operators.

However, a judge dismissed them, saying they related to the publishing of sex-related advertisements and could not be filed because of a federal law protecting free speech that grants immunity to websites that post content created by others.

In the past, the site's operators challenged the California charges on First Amendment grounds.

Officials have struggled with how to deal with the website without violating free speech protections.

Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation incorporated in Delaware, but its principal place of business is in Dallas. Federal officials said Backpage.com has kept its bank accounts and servers in Arizona.

Lacey and Larkin were former owners of the Village Voice and the Phoenix New Times. The indictment said Lacey and Larkin purportedly sold their interest in Backpage.com in 2015, though they had retained control over the site.",am
549,"A French mayor and his wife have gone on trial accused of aggravated tax fraud after a complex five-year investigation into their estimated 13m (£11.3m) fortune.

Police claim Patrick and Isabelle Balkany used a web of offshore companies, foreign bank accounts, lenders and trustees to conceal their wealth.

The couple, who are members of the centre-right Les Républicains party and friends of the former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac, have presided over the chic Parisien suburb of Levallois-Perret for the best part of 35 years.

The 92-page indictment suggested they used increasingly sophisticated methods to keep their wealth hidden from the tax authorities. They deny the charges.

Immediately after the trial opened on Monday afternoon, the judge suspended the hearing to consider defence demands that it be postponed. Isabelle Balkany, who was not in court, was said to be too ill to stand trial following a suicide attempt two weeks ago.

The trial is expected to concentrate on the Balkanys property empire: their main home, a former mill at Giverny, two villas on the Caribbean island of Saint-Martin and a 5m villa in Marrakesh, Morocco.

The couple are accused of setting up multiple offshore structures in Panama, the Seychelles, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Singapore to muddy the trail of ownership. Patrick Balkany is accused of financing half the purchase price of the Marrakesh villa with a commission from a Belgian industrialist in exchange for help to buy a uranium mine in Namibia.

He is also accused of concealing habitual aggravated tax fraud, passive corruption, illegal taking of interests and false declaration to the High Authority for the transparency of political life. His wife is accused of similar tax fraud.

Patrick Balkany was given a suspended 15-month prison sentence in 1996 and declared ineligible for public office for two years for using taxpayers money to pay three municipal workers who were, in fact, working at his home. He was re-elected after returning to political life.

He was also an MP for almost 24 years until the 2017 election, and a departmental councillor for six years. Isabelle Balkany has been deputy mayor of Levallois-Perret since 2001 and vice-president of the departmental council.

Witnesses told police the couple had large sums of cash at their home and that Patrick Balkany often had wads of money in his dressing gown. The existence of an offshore company owned by Balkany was reported in the Panama Papers revelations.

Four others are also on trial accused of fraud or corruption, including the couples 38-year-old son Alexandre Balkany.

Pierre-Olivier Sur, Isabelle Balkanys lawyer, said his client was not accused of misuse of public funds.",am
550,"Summary: Islamabad [Pakistan], July 31 (ANI): The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

Islamabad [Pakistan], July 31 ( ANI ): The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

The notice from the NAB stated that former federal minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi, former secretary Ismail Qureshi, additional secretary Yousaf Memon and ex-secretary of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), Dr Naseem A Khan, have also been nominated in the case, as reported by Geo News.

The reference was filed in connection with the alleged illegal appointment of Basharat Hasan Bashir as a consultant for one of the country's top alternative energy board on a Management Position-II (MP-II) scale salary package.

According to the Express Tribune, the ex-joint secretary of water and power, Ghulam Nabi Mangrio, ex-section officer of water and power, Umar Farooq and retired air marshal and former chairman of AEDB, Shahid Hamid, are also among the accused in the NAB reference.

Allegedly, Bashir was appointed as the consultant in 2006 without following prerequisite procedures. His appointment also violated MP scale policy guidelines.

""After the expiry of his consultancy contract in May 2008, the accused Basharat Hasan Bashir illegally held the said post for almost 5 years without any extension, notification or regular appointment and kept on enjoying salary and all perks and privileges illegally in connivance with the management of AEDB,"" the NAB stated in the reference.

552,"A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares (Luis Martinelli Linares) and Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares (Ricardo Martinelli Linares) for their roles in a massive bribery and money laundering scheme involving Odebrecht S.A. (Odebrecht), a Brazil-based global construction conglomerate.

On Dec. 21, 2016, Odebrecht pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York to a criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its involvement in the bribery and money laundering scheme.

The overarching Odebrecht scheme involved the payment of more than $700 million in bribes to government officials, public servants, political parties, and others in Panama and other countries around the world to obtain and retain business for the company. The two individual defendants are alleged to have participated in the scheme by, among other things, serving as intermediaries for approximately $28 million in bribe payments made by and at the direction of Odebrecht to a then high-ranking government official in Panama (Panama Government Official), who was a close relative of the defendants. Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were arrested at el Aeropuerto Internacional la Aurora in Guatemala on July 6 pursuant to a provisional arrest request from the United States.

As alleged in the complaint, between approximately August 2009 and January 2014, the defendants facilitated the payment of bribes from Odebrecht to or for the benefit of the Panama Government Official by taking a number of steps that included opening and managing secret bank accounts held in the names of shell companies in foreign jurisdictions. These secret bank accounts were used to receive, transfer, and deliver the bribe payments. The defendants served as the signatories on certain of the shell company bank accounts, and personally sent and caused to be sent wire transfers through the structure of shell company bank accounts to conceal and spend bribery proceeds. Many of these financial transactions were in U.S. dollars and were made through U.S. banks, some of which were located in New York.

The charges in the complaint announced today are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The FBIs International Corruption squad in New York investigated this case. Trial Attorney Michael Culhane Harper of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section, Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy and Michael Redmann of the Criminal Divisions Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alixandra Smith and Julia Nestor of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance. The Brazilian Ministerio Publico Federal, Departamento de Polícia Federal, law enforcement authorities in Guatemala including the Public Ministry of Guatemala and Specialized Unit for International Affairs, and law enforcement authorities in El Salvador provided significant cooperation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departments FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

553,"A financial advisor based in Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty today to a money laundering conspiracy for his role in using the U.S. financial system to launder money to promote violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Ecuadorian bribery law violations and to conceal and disguise the true nature of those illegal bribe payments. Specifically, this conspiracy related to a scheme to pay bribes to officials of Ecuadors state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Empresa Pública de Hidrocarburos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador).

U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Kelly Jackson of the IRS-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) Washington, D.C. office, Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Washington, D.C., office and Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBIs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Frank Roberto Chatburn Ripalda (Chatburn), 42, a dual U.S. and Ecuadorian citizen, pleaded guilty in federal district court in Miami before the Honorable Marcia G. Cooke to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a 20-year statutory maximum sentence. Chatburn is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Cooke on Dec. 18.

According to his admissions at the plea hearing, Chatburn conspired with an oil services contractor to pay nearly $3 million in bribes to Ecuadorian government officials in an effort to obtain and retain contracts with PetroEcuador. As a financial advisor to the contractor, Chatburn agreed to make bribe payments for the benefit of several then-PetroEcuador officials through the use of shell companies and bank accounts in the United States, Panama, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and Switzerland. To conceal the bribe payments and to promote the scheme, Chatburn established Panamanian shell companies with Swiss bank accounts on behalf of two then-PetroEcuador officials.

Chatburn further admitted that he conspired with another Ecuadorian government official to conceal bribe payments intended for the official from Odebrecht S.A., the Brazilian construction conglomerate. Chatburn facilitated hiding these bribe payments by conducting the transactions through several shell companies and bank accounts in multiple jurisdictions, including in the United States. Odebrecht S.A. pleaded guilty on Dec. 21, 2016, in the Eastern District of New York to conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA in connection with a broader scheme to pay nearly $800 million in bribes to public officials in twelve countries, including Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Peru and Venezuela.

To date, 10 individuals, including former Ecuadorian government officials, oil services contractors and financial advisors, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in U.S. courts for their involvement in the PetroEcuador bribery and money laundering schemes.

This case was investigated by HSI and IRS-CI, jointly under the auspices of the Global Illicit Financial Team, and by the FBIs International Corruption Squad in Miami. Southern District of Florida Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karen Rochlin, Nalina Sombuntham and Alison W. Lehr have provided substantial assistance with the prosecution of this case, along with Deputy Chief Brian Young, Assistant Chiefs David Fuhr and Lorinda Laryea, Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section, and Trial Attorneys Randall Warden and Mary Ann McCarthy of the Criminal Divisions Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS).

The U.S. Marshals Service and the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs have provided significant assistance by obtaining evidence in this case, as have public authorities in, among other countries, Ecuador, Panama and the Cayman Islands.

A powerful Ukrainian politician was the money man behind a secretive lobbying campaign orchestrated in Europe by disgraced U.S. lobbyist Paul Manafort, leaked emails reveal.

The campaign was meant to convince diplomats and politicians that Ukraines jailing of a prominent opposition leader should not prevent the country from signing an association agreement with the European Union.

Manaforts funder was Serhiy Lovochkin, today a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a leader of its largest opposition party. From 2010 to 2013, he was chief of staff to then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who would later flee to Russia after being overthrown in a popular revolution. Lovochkin had helped run Yanukovychs election campaign along with Manafort, who later served for a time as chairman of U.S. President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign.

The leaked emails also reveal that both Lovochkin and Manafort were involved in an insider scheme to benefit from the privatization of Ukraines public telecom operator.

In a case widely condemned by European leaders as politically motivated, opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted in October 2011 of harming Ukraines national interests during natural gas negotiations with Russia while she was prime minister.

Her sentencing imperilled an important free trade and association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that the Yanukovych administration hoped to sign in 2013.

Our friends in the West have not abandoned us, but they need help from us to withstand the pressure from the Tymoshenko supporters, Manafort wrote in an August 2011 memo to Yanukovych titled Strategy to offset Tymoshenko trial.

The memo was attached to one of thousands of emails obtained by OCCRP that document a decade of correspondence between Manafort, Lovochkin, and others, starting in 2008.

Part of Manaforts strategy was to recruit a Turkish politician and a trio of former European national leaders to promote the view that the association agreement should go forward despite Tymoshenkos imprisonment.

Some details of that lobbying campaign were exposed in Manaforts 2018 indictment, which followed the U.S. Department of Justice investigation led by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Manafort is now serving a prison sentence for tax and bank fraud charges stemming from that indictment, as well as for failing to register as a lobbyist on behalf of Yanukovychs government while attempting to influence American politicians.

Lovochkin was not named in the indictment. But the leaked emails reveal that he was the source of approximately 2 million euros funneled through accounts controlled by Manafort and used to pay lobbyists.

Late Payments

These lobbyists included Mevlut Cavusoglu, a former president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), who was first elected to Turkeys parliament in 2002 and now serves as the countrys foreign minister.

Manafort also recruited the Hapsburg Group, a shadowy informal outfit that consists of former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who previously served as European Commission President.

To coordinate the campaign, Manafort worked with Alan Friedman, an American ex-journalist who is a well-known political commentator and public relations consultant in Italy. Friedman was not charged over his role in the lobbying campaign.

All three members of the Hapsburg Group, as well as Cavusoglu and Friedman, were on Lovochkins payroll, the emails show. By mid-2013, however, Lovochkin was in arrears, and Gusenbauer grew concerned.

On the question of the outstanding payments I want to support you in pushing for a resolution soon, because the members of the Hapsburg Group are neither accustomed to nor willing to accept unjustified delays, Gusenbauer wrote to Friedman in July 2013.

Credit: Tasnim News Agency Mevlut Cavusoglu.

Despite using the term to refer to himself and his colleagues, Gusenbauer told an Austrian news agency in 2018 that he had never heard of the Hapsburg Group. He told OCCRP he had nothing to add to those comments.

Friedman immediately forwarded Gusenbauers email to Manafort, and noted: H Group is pissed.

Credit: Manfred Werner Alfred Gusenbauer.

In order to preserve Sasha [Kwasniewski] and H group cooperation, we need to get three transfers done today or Monday, Friedman urged Manafort. This is becoming awkward.

Friedman also mentioned that he was awaiting a payment for his own work.

According to the email, the Hapsburg Group was owed 700,000 euros in advance for the second half of 2013. Additionally, Gusenbauer was owed for expenses for organizing conferences in the first half of 2013.

Cavusoglu needed a separate transfer of 230,000 euros, Friedman told Manafort, who had his assistant, Konstantin Kilimnik, send the email chain to Lovochkin on the day he received it.

Paul [Manafort] urgently requests SV [Serhiy Volodymrovich Lovochkin] be told the Hapsburg comrades are getting out of control because of non-payment of their services and asks to clarify what he should do, Kilimnik wrote to Lovochkins personal assistant, who forwarded the whole email chain to Lovochkins private address.

Lovochkin apparently paid up, as a conference put on by the Hapsburg Group in Paris went ahead in September as planned.

Conflicts of Interest

Lovochkins press office told OCCRP he had never supervised [the] work of Mr. Manafort.

Kwasniewski said he had not received money from Lovochkin or Friedman.

I dont know anything about the correspondence with people you are writing about, Kwasniewski said. I have received [an] honorarium for my participation at the conferences from the organizers.

He also denied that was unethical to promote the Ukraine governments objectives even as he was tasked by the European Parliament to monitor Tymoshenkos trial in 2012.

There was no conflict of interest with my mandate in the European Parliament and the conferences I have participated in, Kwasniewski told OCCRP. I had the same clear position on the need for Ukraine to sign the Association Agreement with the EU and about the must for releasing political prisoners.

Credit: European University Institute Aleksander Kwasniewski.

But Kwasniewskis two roles were at odds, according to Stefan Meister, a Eurasia specialist with the Heinrich Böll Foundation.

Alexander Kwasniewski had a double role, working for Ukrainian oligarchs and the EU, Meister said. This creates conflicts of interest, which is indeed problematic.

Cavusoglu was also secretly lobbying while serving as a member of a PACE mission to observe Ukraines 2012 parliamentary elections.

Cavusoglu publicly advocated for the association agreement, while urging politicians not to criticize Ukraines government over the Tymoshenko case. He also gave positive reviews of the elections to media, contrary to assessments by international observation groups  including his own  that noted serious irregularities.

The European Parliament, for example, adopted a resolution on Dec. 13, 2012, expressing regret at the fact that, according to the OSCE, PACE, NATO Parliamentary Assembly and European Parliament observers, the election campaign, electoral process and post-electoral process failed to meet major international standards and constitute a step backwards.

Andreas Gross, who led the PACE observation mission, was critical of the electoral process and vocal about Tymoshenkos imprisonment, arguing that she had been jailed on political grounds without sufficient evidence of corruption.

Cavusoglu publicly condemned those comments, telling the news agency Interfax Ukraine that Gross was neither fair nor objective.

Gross told OCCRP that Cavusoglu often had controversial assessments of elections, but he was unaware that Cavusoglu had been engaged by the [Ukrainian] presidents lobby.

When you are indirectly or directly engaged and paid by the government or his consultants, you can never sign up for an observation mission in this same country, Gross said. The conflict of interest of Mevlut is obvious.

Although their activities may have been as unethical as they were lucrative, Cavusoglu and Kwasniewski do not appear to have broken any laws by lobbying while performing duties assigned to them by PACE and the European Parliament.

Neither Cavusoglu nor Prodi, the former Italian prime minister, responded to requests for comment.

In the end, the lobbying campaign orchestrated by Lovochkin and Manafort helped Yanukovych score a major political win. The EU offered Ukraine an association agreement even as its opposition leader was still detained.

But then, in a shocking about-face, Yanukovych refused to sign.

The reversal came after intense Russian pressure to halt the agreement, including the threat of trade disruption and political repercussions.

Yanukovychs choice of Russia over the EU sparked mass protests, which grew into a popular uprising that overturned his government. Accused of corruption and rights abuses, Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014, and parliament freed Tymoshenko from prison.

Ukraine signed an economic association agreement with the EU on June 27, 2014.

556,"SYDNEY  The Australian government on Thursday accused the country's biggest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, of widespread breaches of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.

Financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC said it had initiated civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against CommBank for ""serious and systemic non-compliance,"" in the biggest case of its kind in Australia and the first against a major bank.

""The effect of CommBank's conduct in this matter has exposed the Australian community to serious and ongoing financial crime,"" AUSTRAC said in a court filing.

Commonwealth Bank said in a statement it was reviewing the allegations and would respond ""in due course.""

Australia's biggest mortgage lender failed to report suspicious matters ""either on time or at all involving transactions totalling over AUS $77 million ($61 million),"" AUSTRAC said.

The agency alleged 53,700 contraventions of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act, particularly with regards to so-called intelligent deposit machines or IDMs.

The previous biggest such case came against Australia's top bookmaker Tabcorp Holdings, earlier this year, with only 108 alleged breaches. Tabcorp paid A$45 million in fines, the biggest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.

An AUSTRAC spokeswoman declined to comment on possible penalties facing CommBank, or whether other banks could be in the agency's firing line.

The maximum penalty for contravening the anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing law is AUS $18 million per breach.

Anonymous Deposits

IDMs are a type of automated teller machine that accepts deposits by both cash and check, and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.

There had been significant growth in the use of CommBank's IDMs since their rollout in May 2012, AUSTRAC said. Cash deposits in the six months to June 2016 surged to AUS $5.8 billion compared with AUS $89 million in the first six months after CommBank introduced the machines.

Cash was deposited using fake names with proceeds going to drug importation syndicates, AUSTRAC alleges in its court filings.

""Even after suspected money laundering or structuring on Commbank accounts had been brought to CommBank's attention, CommBank did not monitor its customers with a view to mitigating and managing money laundering/terrorism financing risk,"" the court filing shows.

CommBank accounts were also used for ""cuckoo smurfing,"" a form of money laundering THAT involves transfers between countries without the need for money to actually cross international borders, AUSTRAC added.",am
557,"Paul Erickson, the longtime Republican operative who had a multiyear romantic relationship with accused Russian agent Maria Butina, was indicted on 11 counts wire fraud and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury in South Dakota, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.

The indictment alleges, according to the Justice Department press release, that between 1996 and 2018 Erickson ""knowingly and unlawfully devised a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money from many victims by means of false and fraudulent pretense, representations, and promises."" The charges are not related to Butinas case or the broader investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The multiyear scheme allegedly involved three entities owned and operated by Erickson  Compass Care, Inc., Investing with Dignity, LLC, and an unnamed venture  through which he allegedly defrauded investors for his personal enrichment. He was arrested and released on bond. If convicted, Erickson faces up to 20 years in federal prison for each count.

A lawyer for Erickson told ABC News the charges are ""wholly unfounded"" and ""will be met by a vigorous defense."" He also noted that these charges are entirely unrelated to matters involving Butina, the 30-year-old Russian gun rights activist who was accused of developing a covert influence operation in the United States

Butina recently agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and cooperate with federal, state and local authorities in any ongoing investigations.

She admitted, as part of the deal, that she and an unnamed ""U.S. Person 1,"" which sources have identified as Erickson, ""agreed and conspired, with a Russian government official (""Russian Official"") and at least one other person, for Butina to act in the United States under the direction of Russian Official without prior notification to the Attorney General.""

Based on the description, the ""Russian Official"" appears to be Alexander Torshin, the former deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Under his direction, the agreement said, she sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics.

It is unclear what Butinas cooperation might entail, but federal prosecutors have reportedly notified Erickson that he is a target of an ongoing investigation. The target letter sent to Erickson is from federal prosecutors in Washington, sources familiar with the case told ABC News, and separate from any South Dakota-based federal fraud investigation into his business dealings.",am
558,"(CNN) The idea of a private border wall started with a GoFundMe campaign that rapidly raked in more than $20 million. Now prosecutors accuse former top Trump aide Steve Bannon and others tied to the project of defrauding donors and pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses.

It's the latest development in a project that's spurred controversy since its inception, while drawing millions of dollars of support and endorsements from many Trump allies.

Here's a look at some of the key events that have unfolded since the project began in 2018:

The campaign begins

Brian Kolfage, a triple amputee and Air Force veteran, starts a GoFundMe campaign in December 2018 saying ""political inaction"" has inspired him to raise private funds for a border wall. Within days, the project raises more than $20 million dollars.

Construction starts

The nonprofit created in connection with the campaign, ""We Build the Wall,"" announces in May 2019 it has broken ground on its first private border wall project in Sunland Park, New Mexico. ""Buckle up, we're just getting started,"" the group says in a Facebook post. Organizers say the private wall is about a mile long.

Ordered to 'cease and desist'

Days later, city officials order construction to ""cease and desist,"" stating that proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage calls the order ""political intimidation.""

Dispute with a federal agency

The next month a federal agency forces open a gate in the new, privately constructed border wall, arguing proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage slams the commission, accusing the agency of overreaching its authority.

A wall on the Rio Grande

Contractor Fisher Industries begins work on a three-mile stretch of private border wall in November 2019. It's located on a sugar cane farm in Mission, Texas, along the Rio Grande. Kolfage tells CNN that We Build the Wall provided $1.5 million for that project, describing that as 9% of the total cost.

The project is temporarily halted after being sued by federal prosecutors and the National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre wild butterfly habitat near the project's location, but later is allowed to resume. Fisher's method of building just feet from the Rio Grande becomes a point of contention, in part because of the potential for flooding and damage to surrounding property.

A new proposal

Interviews and correspondence obtained exclusively by CNN in February 2020 show that We Build the Wall had been communicating with the Trump administration about plans to build a wall along the southern border and donate it to the US government.

Reports of erosion

As a part of its lawsuit over the private project, the butterfly center says it documented erosion at the base of the Texas wall in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna in July 2020. Photos viewed by CNN show cracks in the ground between the wall and the river.

""We've got another storm headed this way. If a 'Category 1' already caused so much damage, I hate to see what this next storm is going to do,"" says Javier Peña, a lawyer for the center.

In response to allegations of erosion, Kolfage in August 2020 .

New York federal prosecutors charge Kolfage, Bannon and two others in August 2020 with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of the border wall fundraising campaign. Bannon, Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

559,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors charged a Texas man on Tuesday with fraudulently seeking $5 million in loans from an emergency program established to ease the economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint that Samuel Yates, 32, of Maud, Texas, sought millions of dollars in Small Business Administration-guaranteed loans from two different banks. Yates claimed to employ over 400 people, although in reality no employees worked for his purported business, prosecutors said in a statement.

This defendant allegedly sought to steal millions of dollars in loans intended to aid legitimate small businesses grappling with the economic effects of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, said Brian Benczkowski, head of the Justice Departments Criminal Division.

Prosecutors said charges Yates faces include violating statutes relating to wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements to a financial institution and making false statements to the SBA.

They said Yates made two fraudulent applications to two different lenders for loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the virus-relief plan called the Paycheck Protection Program.

In an application submitted to one of the lenders, Yates allegedly sought $5 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 400 employees with an average monthly payroll of $2 million.

In his second loan application, prosecutors say Yates claimed to employ over 100 individuals and was able to obtain a loan of more than $500,000.

To back up these applications, prosecutors say Yates submitted a list of purported employees that he obtained from a publicly available random name generator on the internet. He also submitted forged tax documents with each application.",am
560,"A chairman of Tajikistan's central bank allegedly diverted more than $850m (£572m) to a company run by himself and his family, according to an independent audit posted on the bank's website yesterday.

The Ernst & Young audit alleged that under Murodali Alimardonov's stewardship from 1996 to 2008 the bank paid about $856m to his Credit-Invest company, a general purpose investment concern. A further $221.5m allocated for investment in the cotton industry in 2004-2007 remains unaccounted for, the audit said.

Gross financial irregularities are common in the former Soviet republic, which borders China and Afghanistan. The International Monetary Fund last year demanded repayment of $47m in loans, amid charges that the Tajik authorities doctored data on national reserves.

However, the sum of money allegedly appropriated by Alimardonov, who has served as deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture since leaving the bank job last year, are enormous for the country, whose economy suffers from severe power shortages and lack of investment.

Tajik authorities agreed to the audit of the central bank and other state enterprises after the IMF scandal. Ernst & Young said many documents needed for its work were destroyed before the audit.",am

After a federal investigation, Rep. Grimm was hit with a 20-count federal indictment in April 2014. The indictment claims that the Republican Congressman failed to pay taxes on $1 million in income and that he hired illegal workers. The charges are serious, even if he weren't an elected official.

Among other things, the indictment claims that Mr. Grimm under-reported sales and wages of over $1 million, paid workers in cash under the table, and kept two sets of payroll ledgers. Rep. Grimm allegedly used cash to avoid payroll taxes, income taxes and workers compensation premiums. The immigration status of his workers has also been questioned.

Part of the charges also relate to his response to questions. When asked in a deposition under oath, Rep. Grimm is charged with falsely testifying that he did not pay any of his workers in cash. Those statements were made in the course of a lawsuit by former Healthalicious employees, who claimed they were not paid minimum wage.

Initially, Rep. Grimm called the indictment a politically motivated witch hunt, and he vowed to fight the charges. And he won re-election to the House in November, beating challenger Domenic Recchia, Jr. to maintain his seat in New York's 11th Congressional District. He even got 53 percent of the vote despite the charges against him. But now he is poised to plead guilty.

It is not clear whether Rep. Grimm will seek to maintain his seat in Congress, though he could face discipline from the House of Representatives, including expulsion. It does not appear that he would face automatic expulsion. Notably, these charges do not include allegations of campaign finance violations and as serious as they are, only relate to Mr. Grimms role with Healthalicious.

But there have been fundraising concerns too. Concerning Rep. Grimm's fundraising, a former fundraiser for his campaign named Diana Durand has already pleaded guilty to funneling illegal contributions to his 2010 campaign. Rep. Grimm is a former FBI agent, and represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn.

As for the pattern of keeping two sets of books and paying in cash, both irregularities feature commonly in tax evasion cases. For example, the president and founder of Detroit-based Happys Pizza, Happy Asker, was recently found guilty of 32 tax crimes and conspiracy to defraud the United States. The jury took 4½ hours to convict on three counts of filing false returns, 28 counts of aiding and assisting the filing of false returns for Happys Pizza franchises, and one count of engaging in a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the administration of the Internal Revenue Code.

In that case, two sets of books and cash payments also featured prominently.",am
562,"German payments giant Wirecard has filed for insolvency in the midst of a major accounting scandal linked to a 1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its finances.

The company, which processes tens of billions of euros in credit and debit transactions every year, said it failed to reach a deal with its lenders that could help it stay afloat following a turbulent week that involved the resignation and arrest of its chief executive.

Following the announcement, its auditor EY, which discovered the missing funds a week ago, said there were clear indications of an elaborate and sophisticated fraud involving multiple parties around the world. It said during the 2019 audit it was given false information and reported this to the relevant authorities. It added: Even the most robust and extended audit procedures may not uncover a collusive fraud.

Wirecard declined to comment following the EY statement.
Earlier, announcing the insolvency move, Wirecard said: In the absence of an agreement with the lenders, there was a likelihood of termination and expiry of loans with a volume of 800m on 30 June 30 and 500m on 1 July 1.

A regulatory statement released by the company on Thursday added: The management board of Wirecard AG decided today to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings on behalf of Wirecard AG at the competent Munich local court due to the threat of insolvency and over-indebtedness.

The development comes just days after its former chief executive Markus Braun was arrested on suspicion of falsifying accounts at the company. He was arrested after presenting himself to police, according to German media.

Braun, 51, was bailed from police custody after posting a deposit of 5m on Tuesday, according to public prosecutors in Munich.

Wirecard said it was evaluating whether it would have to file insolvency applications for its subsidiaries, which include UK operations based in Newcastle. The company, founded in 1999, employs about 5,800 staff across its 26 locations and has more than 313,000 customers, according to its website.

The companys shares, which have lost more than 95% of their value within days, were temporarily suspended from trading in Frankfurt. The shares were trading hands at around 2.65 on Thursday, comparedwith 104 last Wednesday.

The German tech company, which was one of the countrys fastest-growing blue-chip companies, was thrown into crisis last week when EY said it was unable to trace about 1.9bn of cash in the companys accounts. That sum was worth about a quarter of its balance sheet.

Wirecard initially said the money was supposed to be in trustee accounts in two banks in the Philippines. However, the countrys central bank said the cash had never entered its monetary systems, while two commercial banks  BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands  said that despite the companys insistence, they had no relationship with Wirecard.

Braun resigned last Friday, the same day the company confirmed its headquarters were searched as part of a market manipulation investigation launched by Germanys financial regulator BaFin. By Monday, the management board admitted that the funds in all likelihood  do not exist .

Braun presented himself to police and was arrested on Monday evening. German prosecutors have said they believe the former chief executive may have artificially inflated the companys assets and income through fake transactions, to make the company seem financially stronger and more attractive to investors and customers.

The arrest came nearly two months after a special six-month audit by KPMG was not able to verify some of Wirecards transactions with third parties.

The scandal has thrown BaFin under the spotlight over the the way it has handled critics of Wirecard since 2018.

The watchdog temporarily banned short selling of Wirecard shares, a step it had never taken for an individual company, saying there were signs of manipulative behaviour potentially including insider trading. It also launched an investigation into reporters at the Financial Times, who in October reported that Wirecard staff had potentially conspired to fraudulently inflate sales and profits for a decade.

BaFin president Felix Hufeld admitted on Monday that the Wirecard scandal was a complete disaster and criticised his own organisations inaction.

Meanwhile EY itself is facing a class action suit by Berlin-based law firm Schirp & Partner and attorney Marc Liebscher on behalf of aggrieved shareholder and bond investors. It is frightening how long Wirecard AG was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors, the law firms founding partner Wolfgang Schirp said in a statement. A spokesperson for Schirp said the claim could end up being worth more than 500m.

EY said: We dont comment on pending litigation.",am
563,"PARIS: A Paris court on Friday fined Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan for disclosing the name of one of several women who have accused him of rape, violating a French law that protects alleged victims from retaliation and harassment.

Ramadan, who denies the five rape charges against him, was fined 3,000 ($3,560), with 2,000 suspended, for revealing the womans full name in a 2019 book as well as during a TV interview.

The woman, known in French media reports only as Christelle, says Ramadan raped her in a hotel room in Lyon, southeast France, in 2009.

Her allegation came shortly after another woman, feminist activist Henda Ayari, also accused him of rape. Those claims were later followed by rape accusations by two other women.

Ramadan, whose grandfather founded Egypts Muslim Brotherhood, was a professor at Oxford University until he was forced to take leave when the rape allegations surfaced at the height of the Me Too movement in 2017.

Last month, prosecutors filed a fifth rape charge against him, involving an alleged assault against Mounia Rabbouj, a former escort.

Her testimony had forced Ramadan, a father of four, to admit to extramarital relations for the first time, but he stressed they were consensual.

On Friday, Ramadan and his books editor were also ordered to pay Christelle 5,000 in damages and interest.

She had argued in court that after failing to halt the books publication, the disclosure of her name had become the cornerstone of a harassment campaign against her by Ramadans supporters.

His lawyers said they would appeal the ruling.",nam
564,"NEW YORK: The parent of Dunkin' Donuts on Tuesday (Sep 15) agreed to upgrade its security protocols and pay US$650,000 in fines and costs to settle a lawsuit by New York's attorney general claiming it ignored cyberattacks that compromised the online accounts of tens of thousands of customers.

Attorney General Letitia James said Dunkin' Brands Group Inc will notify customers affected by the attacks between 2015 and 2018, reset their passwords, and provide refunds for unauthorised use of their Dunkin'-branded stored value cards.

The settlement resolves a civil lawsuit filed last Sep 26 in a New York state court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval.

Dunkin' did not admit or deny wrongdoing.

The case arose after hackers began in early 2015 using previously stolen user names and passwords to conduct automated ""brute force"" and ""credential stuffing"" attacks, and steal tens of thousands of dollars from accounts created through Dunkin's website or free mobile app.

James said the Canton, Massachusetts-based company did nothing for years to address the compromised accounts despite repeated alerts from its own app developer, including when it identified 19,715 customers targeted over a five-day period.

The attorney general also said Dunkin' failed to adopt safeguards against future attacks despite reports of continuing fraud. She said that came to roost in late 2018, when more than 300,000 customer accounts were accessed in new attacks.

""For years, Dunkin' hid the truth and failed to protect the security of its customers, who were left paying the bill,"" James said. ""It's time to make amends and finally fill the holes in Dunkin's' cybersecurity.""

In a separate statement, Dunkin' said the cyberattacks potentially affected less than 1 per cent of its Perks Loyalty members, and the hackers had no access to credit card information.

""We have taken steps to make sure that any stored value cards associated with [digital customers'] accounts are protected and secure,"" it added.",am
565,"A total of 58 people have been charged in healthcare fraud schemes that have seen 6.2 million opioid pills distributed across Texas illegally, in what federal prosecutors believe has cost Medicare and Medicaid $66million in losses.

Of Wednesday's accused, 20 people were charged for diverting opioids and 16 were medical professionals - including six doctors and seven pharmacists - including one pharmacy in Houston that dished out more than 760,000 pills from March 2018 to September 2019.

In Houston, runners would bring the prescriptions - written on counterfeit pads and associated with doctors whose identities were stolen - to the pharmacy to be filled on a cash-only basis while they charged more than five times the market rate for drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.

Prosecutors estimated fraudulent claims for compound creams worth $158million, as well as $23million in tax evasion from the schemes, and said Wednesday they had frozen $60million in assets of the people accused.

'The data in our possession shines an inescapable light on those dirty doctors, clinic owners, pharmacists and others who may have long believed that they could perpetrate their fraud in the dark, behind closed doors,' Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski told a news briefing in Dallas. 'I hope today's action brings home a simple message for those that engage in these despicable frauds. You're not invisible.'

He added: 'Three weeks ago, I had the opportunity to be in Houston to announce a major opioid takedown against dozens of defendants involving over 23 million opioid pills. Todays additional chargesas well as the recent creation of our Health Care Fraud Strike Force in the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonioare proof positive that the Criminal Division continues to dedicate resources to root out healthcare fraud in Texas and elsewhere, and we are doing so strategically and aggressively.'

Michael Charles Braddick, Kyle Martin Hermesch, and Bioflex Medical in Dallas were charged for their alleged participation in a scheme to defraud the Department of Labor- Office of Worker's Compensation Programs.

Also accused of defrauding the Office of Worker's Compensation are Jamshid Noryian, Dehshid Nourian, Christopher Rydberg, Leyla Nourian, Ashraf Mofid, Dr. Leslie Benson, Dr. Michael Taba, and Ali Khavarmanesh.

They were charged for their alleged participation in a scheme that also defrauded Blue Cross Blue Shield.

It's claimed they conspired to launder money and evade tax payments through businesses Ability Pharmacy, Industrial & Family Pharmacy, and Park Row Pharmacy, all located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

Nehaj Rizvi was charged for his alleged participation in a scheme to defraud Medicare through Life Spring Housecall Physicians, Inc., a company located in Dallas, Texas.

Bruce Stroud and Bobbi Stroud were charged for their alleged participation in a scheme to defraud Medicare through New Horizons Durable Medical Equipment, Striffin Medical Supply, and 4B Ortho Supply, all durable medical equipment companies located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

'Health care fraud undermines our country by driving up medical costs, wasting taxpayer dollars, and often harming patients,' said Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General Special Agent in Charge C.J. Porter. 'Today's takedown shows that we are fighting hard to protect Medicare and Medicaid and the patients served by those programs. Working closely with our law enforcement partners, our agents are determined to ensure fraudsters pay for their crimes.'

Dr. Brian Carpenter and Jerry Hawrylak were charged for their alleged participation in a scheme to defraud TRICARE through a compounding pharmacy located in Fort Worth, Texas. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Brynn Schiess of the Fraud Section.

Nilesh Patel, Dr. Craig Henry, and Bruce Henry were charged for their alleged participation in a scheme to defraud TRICARE through marketing company RxConsultants and a compounding pharmacy located in Fort Worth, Texas. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Carlos Lopez of the Fraud Section.

Leah Hagen and Michael Hagen were charged for their alleged participation in conspiracies to pay and receive kickbacks and launder money through Metro DME Supply and Ortho Pain Solutions, both durable medical equipment companies in Arlington, Texas.

The opioid crisis has been marked by nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest US data. About 218,000 of those deaths have been from prescription opioids, while the rest were from illicit opioids including heroin.

Some 45,000 people a year overdose on opioids in the United States, U.S. Attorney John Bash of the Western District of Texas said on Wednesday.

'The scale of this crisis is enormous,' he said.

Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBI's Dallas Field Office added: 'Today's announcement demonstrates the close collaboration between the FBI and its law enforcement partners in North Texas.

'The enormous economic damage caused by those who defraud crucial public health programs, as well as the ever-increasing loss of life caused by illicit and illegitimate pill schemes cannot be overstated. The public can rest assured the FBI will continue to make these investigations a top priority moving forward.'",am
566,"SAN DIEGO 

Former Rep. Duncan Hunter will serve his 11-month sentence for conspiring to misuse campaign funds at a West Texas prison camp, his attorney said Friday.

Hunter is due to report to Federal Correctional Institution La Tuna on Jan. 4. The prison is in the El Paso suburb of Anthony, on the Texas-New Mexico state line. He will serve in its adjacent minimum-security satellite camp, according to CQ Roll Call.

Hunters attorney, Devin Burstein, on Friday confirmed the report that Hunter had been assigned to the facility.

Hunter fought a 60-count indictment for more than a year before pleading guilty to a conspiracy charge in December.

His wife, Margaret Hunter, pleaded guilty in June 2019 of conspiring with her husband to misuse more than $250,000 in campaign money on personal expenses such as travel, groceries, fast food and private school tuition.

Alan Ellis, a defense attorney who writes the Federal Prison Guidebook, told Roll Call he suspects Hunter is being sent to a facility 10 hours away to get him away from his sphere of influence  something Ellis said is common for high-profile prisoners.

FCI La Tuna also is where former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca is serving a three-year sentence for obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.

Hunters criminal charges in August 2018 came more than two years after the Federal Election Commission and the San Diego Union-Tribune questioned Hunter in April 2016 about expenditures his campaign had reported  a series of video-game purchases and a payment to his childrens private school.

According to the indictment, the Hunters relied for years on campaign contributions to pay routine family expenses such as dental bills, home repairs and fast-food meals. They also used the money for exotic vacations, private school tuition, plane tickets for Margarets mother to and from Poland, and a flight for a pet rabbit.

Immediately after the indictment, Hunter said the charges were the result of a deep state conspiracy among partisan Democrat prosecutors and denied any wrongdoing. He continued denying the charges after his wife had pleaded guilty and agreed to work with prosecutors.

Then, in December, Hunter pleaded guilty in order to spare his children the spectacle of a trial, he said. Initially he was scheduled to begin serving his time in May, but that was pushed back because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hunter left Congress in January, and his seat in the 50th District, encompassing central and northeastern San Diego County and parts of Riverside County, has been vacant since. Former Republican Rep. Darrel Issa and Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar are in a tight race to replace him.",am
567,"STOCKHOLM Swedbank AB said Friday that Swedens financial supervisory authority is investigating the bank for suspected breaches of market-abuse regulations.

In a statement, the bank said the investigation covers the period between Sep. 20, 2018, through Feb. 20, 2019, and relates to the disclosure of insider information and the obligation to establish an insider list in connection with the disclosure of suspected money laundering within the company.

The Swedish FSA confirmed that it has opened an investigation. Swedbank said it is assisting in the investigation.

Swedbank has been in the spotlight in recent years after a Swedish TV show reported in 2019 that billions of dollars in potentially illicit funds may have passed through the banks Estonian branch.

Following a probe that concluded earlier this year, the Swedish FSA handed Swedbank a 4 billion Swedish kronor fine after finding the lenders Baltic operations had serious deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering measures as well as shortcomings in its cooperation with the investigation.

A law firm hired by the bank also concluded that it had inadequate systems to manage money-laundering risk, but said it didnt conclude that Swedbank engaged in money laundering.

In March, Swedbank said it notified the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control of potential sanctions violations regarding $4.8 million of transactions following an internal probe.

Swedbank has undergone a leadership shuffle, including the hiring top risk and compliance executives. The lender last year named a new chief executive and appointed a permanent chief compliance officer. In March, the lender named a new chief risk officer.",am

569,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russias FSB security service planned and organized the murder of a Georgian man in Berlin last summer, a killing that triggered diplomatic expulsions from Germany and Moscow, the investigative website Bellingcat said on Monday.

Citing mobile phone metadata and a months-long investigation conducted with Der Spiegel and The Insider, Bellingcat published information it said showed the assassin was trained and supplied with false identity papers by the FSB, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB.

The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied involvement in the killing.

The Russian-Georgian victim, known as Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was a former Chechen rebel who had fought against Russian forces. He was shot dead on Aug. 23 in a Berlin park.

Surveillance footage showed his killer cycled up to him but that Khangoshvili had managed to push him over. He then tried to flee, but his killer pursued him and shot him at least twice, German prosecutors have said.

His suspected killer, a man traveling on a Russian passport, is in German custody.

Germany expelled two Russian diplomats in December over what it said was Moscows refusal to cooperate in the investigation. Russia responded by expelling two German diplomats.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in December that Khangoshvili was himself a killer who took part in bloody acts on Russian soil.

Putin called Khangoshvili a cruel and blood-thirsty person, saying the murdered man had fought on the side of anti-Moscow separatists in Russias mainly Muslim north Caucasus region.

A fierce online controversy is unfolding around a young Chinese celebrity Zhou Zhennan, as his wealthy parents were revealed to owe hundreds of millions of yuan in debts.

What's the story?

Zhou Zhennan, a 20-year-old singer, has more than 10 million followers on Weibo following success on a talent show. He has often hinted that he is from a rich and privileged family and has repeatedly shown off his palatial family villa complete with three maids.

However, in recent days multiple media sources have reported that Zhou's father, Zhou Yong, has been on a government blacklist of dishonest persons subject to enforcement since 2016, which means he is restricted from buying certain luxury goods or flying first class. On top of this, Zhous fathers companies have allegedly accumulated debts worth hundreds of millions of yuan.

Also, a property complex sold by Zhou Senior has come under considerable criticism from residents. Supposedly the buildings are of low quality with bricks falling off walls, and sewage overflowing in the basements.

Zhou Zhennan posted an apology on Weibo on Oct 26, saying that he knew nothing of his parents' situation, adding (Ill) help my father overcome these difficulties and help all the people who have been affected to recover their losses.

What are people saying online?

Although the legal experts have noted that Zhou Zhennan has no legal obligation to take responsibility for his father's liabilities, furious netizens have criticized him and have urged him to pay back his fathers debts. One typical comment read, You and your parents live in a big villa and enjoy a luxurious life while those victims are living in rotten buildings. Zhou Zhennan, come out and pay back the money!

572,"A director at London-based lending firm Zopa has stepped down after being arrested in connection with a $420 million money laundering investigation in India.

On 27 January, multiple news reports in India revealed that Kapil Wadhawan  who is also the chairman of troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in Mumbai and Wadhawan Global Capital (WGC)  was in the Enforcement Directorates (ED) custody.

According to Business Today, the ED identified properties worth INR 30 billion ($420.8 million) allegedly belonging to Wadhawan in the country and abroad.

The agency suspects these assets were bought with funds siphoned off from DHFL and laundered through hawala (a traditional system of transferring money) channels.

Wadhawan was arrested in relation to this chain of events, which also involved gangster Dawood Ibrahims close aide Iqbal Mirchi.

Its a complex case but the above summary will suffice. There has been plenty of speculation around this matter  i.e. he was booted out  and Fintech Direct contacted Zopa today (10 February) to ensure complete accuracy.

The firm responded quickly, albeit in the style of Ernest Hemingway: As part of the planned [£140 million] investment by IAG, we are reorganising our board. As part of this process, WGC have agreed to give up their board seat in Zopa post the completion of the deal, and Kapil Wadhawan has resigned from the Zopa Group Board with immediate effect.

You can mull about the timing. But either way its not the kind of news story Zopa wants.

WGC got involved with the lendtech back in 2017 when it was part of Zopas £32 million Series F funding round. As part of that deal, Wadhawan got on the Zopa board, opened a UK subsidiary, and took a stake in the firm.

What did Zopa get? A massive headache probably.

Also today, the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Contributory Provident Fund Trust moved the National Company Law Tribunal to recover dues from DHFL.

Javier Santos, the head of Honduras Specialized Prosecutors Unit Against Corruption (Unidad Fiscal Especializada contra la Corrupción  UFERCO), said on Twitter that there is overwhelming evidence that 28 million lempiras (about $1.2 million) were diverted from municipal coffers.

According to a report from a non-governmental organization, the Center for Democracy Studies (Centro de Estudio para la Democracia  CESPAD), the mayors office of Tegucigalpa created a trust in 2011 to receive funds from municipal fees and taxes. On January 28, 2014, three days after Asfura began his term as mayor, the terms of the trust were modified to allow him and several other people access to it.

Between 2017 and 2018, three accounts at a private bank were opened for political campaign contributions, political contributions from own assets and accrued salary. About 17.5 million lempiras ($708,000) from the trust were deposited in the accounts via 23 checks, CESPAD reported. UFERCO alleges that the money was then moved to accounts registered to the mayor and others, according to reports by CESPAD and Expediente Público.

On October 28, the Supreme Court granted a  recurso de amparo  a petition to a high-level court claiming a violation of constitutional civil rights  in effect halting any new investigation into the presidential candidate.

However, the courts decision does not affect the preliminary trial, which is handled by a lower court, because the evidence has already been collected. It does not represent any obstacle in the preliminary trial proceedings, Santos, the head of UFERCO, wrote in a tweet.

In September, Asfura announced his candidacy as the ruling National Party (Partido Nacional  PN)s presidential candidate through an internal movement called Unity and Hope. According to politicians from the PN, Asfura is the candidate endorsed by the countrys current president, Juan Orlando Hernández.

InSight Crime Analysis

Being accused of embezzlement, or even having a conviction for drug money laundering, is clearly no obstacle to running for president in Honduras.

Yani Rosenthal, a powerful Honduran banker who completed a three-year US prison sentence in August after pleading guilty to charges of laundering drug trafficking proceeds, has announced his candidacy for the Liberal Party ticket.

The National and the Liberal parties, Honduras two traditional political parties, have traded the Central American countrys presidency for four decades.

The accusations of corruption and links with organized crime dogging the two candidates, both of whom stand a good chance of winning the presidency in 2021, add to the seemingly never-ending string of scandals that have ensnared Honduras political class in recent years.

Honduras most powerful drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros, bribed the countrys former president and opened a line of communication to current President Juan Orlando Hernández.

The presidents brother, Tony, is awaiting US sentencing for drug trafficking  a case in which the president himself was named a co-conspirator and accused of receiving illicit cash. Hernández even assumed the presidency in 2017 amid allegations of fraud that included bribery and vote-buying. Money embezzled from Honduras Social Security Institute also ended up in his campaigns coffers in his first presidential run in 2013.

On the opposite side of the political spectrum, relatives of former Liberal President Manuel Zelaya have too been named in US courts for allegedly receiving money from Los Cachiros.

With such candidates for president, the shadow of corruption and narco-politics hangs over Honduras next election before the race has even gotten started.",am
576,"Former BHS owner Dominic Chappell has been jailed for six years for evading £584,000 in taxes.

Chappell failed to pay the tax on £2.2m in income he received after buying the chain for £1 in 2015 from retail tycoon Sir Philip Green.

Meanwhile he splashed out on a luxury lifestyle which included a £90,000 yacht, a Bentley Continental car, and a Bahamas holiday.

BHS collapsed in 2016 after 88 years on the high street - with the failure costing 11,000 jobs and leaving a gaping pension deficit.

Serial bankrupt Chappell, 53, was convicted of evading VAT, corporation tax and income tax after a trial at London's Southwark crown court.

The charges related to Chappell's personal services company Swiss Rock, which was paid to facilitate the purchase of BHS by Retail Acquisitions Ltd, where he was a director.

The judge, Mr Justice Bryan, said the businessman had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"".

Chappell's lawyers had claimed Chappell was left ""utterly broke"" after the scale of BHS's pension problems ""exploded"" within two weeks of him buying BHS and that, had it not failed, he would have been able to pay the tax liability.

The businessman, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, had told the court he was ""simply too busy"" to sort out his business dealings properly and sought to blame former owner Sir Philip and auditors PwC for his misfortunes.

But the judge told him: ""You were not overwhelmed by your other pressures, and you were not too busy or under too much pressure to spare the time to buy yourself trappings of luxury with monies that would have been better deployed to pay the taxes due.""

He told Chappell that he could not ""lay all the blame"" for being left penniless ""at the door of others including Sir Philip Green"".

It is the latest court action faced by Chappell following the BHS failure.

In November 2019 he was banned from running a company for ten years and in January this year he was ordered by The Pensions Regulator to pay £9.5m into BHS's retirement schemes.

Sir Philip, the man who sold the retailer to Chappell, faced severe criticism in the wake of its collapse, with MPs branding him the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"" and calling for him to be stripped of his knighthood.

The tycoon later described the select committee findings as ""bizarre"".",am
577,"The impact that Odebrecht has had on the business and political climates of many nations around the world is difficult to overstate. Unfortunately, the Brazilian construction company that grew into an international behemoth has become synonymous with bribery, corruption and scandal, prompting waves of protest around the globe. According to Business Insider, the company used various illicit practices to secure roughly 100 projects in 12 countries, ending up with about $3.3 billion in ill-gotten gains in the process. While that is a massive sum of money to be sure, Odebrecht's most lasting impact may be on the individual countries and communities affected by its activities; in the wake of revelations about corruption at the company, it has become clear that many important political and business figures around the world were involved in some way or another.

History of the Company

Odebrecht was founded in Brazil in 1944 as a construction outfit. For decades, the company continued to develop, becoming an international company in the late 1970s and establishing a holding company a few years later.

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Odebrecht began to engage in bribery of officials only in 2001, after more than 50 years of history. It was in 2006 when the practice of bribing officials became especially common throughout the company; indeed, Odebrecht reportedly created an entire division dedicated to paying out bribes and other corrupt dealings. This division, called the Division of Structure Operations, had a separate computer system from the remainder of the company.

Building Corrupt Infrastructure

Besides this separate, complex computer system, Odebrecht also began to set up offshore accounts. In around 2010, the company allegedly bought a branch of an Austrian bank in Antigua to assist in further streamlining these illegal activities. Thanks to this complicated, well-developed system, Odebrecht was able to pay out roughly $788 million in bribes.

Collapse of the System

Brazilian officials began a sting called Operation Car Wash in 2014 involving Odebrecht and the Brazilian oil company Petrobras. Through this operation, officials determined that Odebrecht engaged in bid rigging, a process in which multiple companies would seemingly compete for projects. In actuality, though, Odebrecht oversaw the system, manipulating the process for its own gain.

Authorities in several nations are still working to sort out the details of Odebrecht's illegal activities. Along the way, the investigation has uncovered evidence that many prominent politicians and public figures were involved. According to lead prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, quoted in a BBC report, ""this case implicated almost one-third of Brazil's senators and almost half of all Brazil's governors."" Even the president of Peru and the vice president of Ecuador were implicated, with the former having resigned and the latter now in prison.

Wherever the Odebrecht case ends up, it's likely to only involve more people and more illegal activity as the drama unfolds.",am
578,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch court on Wednesday said it wanted to question the Dutch bank ING INGA.AS and its former chief executive Ralph Hamers, now heading for UBS, to determine whether to reopen a case that led to ING being fined for lax prevention of money laundering.

ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands, paid 775 million euro ($876 million) in a settlement with Dutch prosecutors in 2018, after failing for years to spot money laundering and other criminal activities happening through its accounts.

The settlement ended an investigation into ING and kept the bank and its board free of any criminal charges.

But a group of disgruntled investors felt justice had not been served and the court in The Hague had said it would take their demands into consideration.

The court said on Wednesday that it needed to question Hamers, set to become chief executive of the Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S in November, and ING to determine whether further investigation was called for.

If the case is reopened, the existing settlement will become invalid.

A spokesman for ING said it was standard procedure to hear the parties involved at this stage of an investigation. Hamers could not immediately be contacted for comment.",am
579,"Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four others were arrested and charged Tuesday as part of a $60 million racketeering and bribery probe that investigators called the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme against the people of the state of Ohio.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio David DeVillers announced the arrest of Householder, a Republican, and four codefendants as part of a year-long investigation into public corruption and bribery tied to legislation that bailed out two nuclear power plants in the state.

These allegations are bribery, pure and simple, DeVillers said during a press conference. This was quid pro quo, this was pay to play.

Along with Householder, former Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth were also arrested in connection to the investigation.

Householder has been speaker since 2019 after previously having the position from 2001 to 2004. He left office due to term limits but rejoined the House in 2017. He is seen as one of the most powerful and influential state lawmakers in Ohio.

The allegations have rocked the state's political scene, with Ohio GOP Gov. Mike DeWine calling for the speakers resignation on Tuesday.

Because of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to effectively lead the Ohio House of Representatives; therefore, I am calling on Speaker Householder to resign immediately, DeWine said. This is a sad day for Ohio.

While neither DeVillers nor FBI Special Agent Chris Hoffman would go into detail about the case, it is known that Householder was one of the driving forces behind a roughly $1 billion financial rescue for Ohios two nuclear power plants, which appeared to be tied to several targets of the investigation. The legislation added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.

Previous attempts to bail out the nuclear plants had stalled in the legislature before Householder became speaker. Months after taking over, he rolled out a new plan to subsidize the plants and eliminate renewable energy incentives. The proposal was approved a year ago despite opposition from many business leaders and the manufacturing industry.

Generation Now, a group that successfully fought an effort to put a repeal of the bailout law on Ohios ballot, was charged as a corporation in the case.

FirstEnergy Corp., whose former subsidiaries owned the plants, donated heavily to Householders campaigns and his backers in the Ohio House. The utilitys political action committee contributed $25,000 to Householders campaign in 2018, according to an analysis by Common Cause Ohio, a government watchdog.

The defendants appeared in court and were not required to enter a plea. The judge ordered Householder released on his own recognizance and directed him not to obtain a passport, to restrict his travel to the southern half of Ohio and not to contact any other defendants. The judge also ordered him to remove any guns from his home.

Similar restrictions were imposed on Longstreth. The next hearing was tentatively set for Aug. 6.

This is the first time a racketeering charge has been used on a public official in the Southern District of Ohio, Hoffman said, during the press conference. When lawmakers act as criminals, the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys Office are there and watching for it.

Despite the arrests of Householder and his codefendants, DeVillers said the racketeering investigation is far from over and that it will now move into a public phase.

As of this morning there are a lot of FBI agents knocking on doors, there are a lot of FBI agents asking questions, fulfilling subpoenas, he said. This is by no means over, we are going to continue this investigation.

This is also not the first time Householder has been investigated for questionable practices.

At the time he left office, he and several top advisers were under federal investigation for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government closed the case without filing charges.

Householder is the second Ohio House speaker to come under investigation in just over two years.

Former Republican Speaker Cliff Rosenberger was investigated in 2018 amid an FBI inquiry into his travel, lavish lifestyle and a condo he rented from a wealthy GOP donor. Rosenberger, who has maintained he broke no laws, has not been charged, but the investigation remains open.",am

581,"LOS ANGELES  A 252-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed today charges 80 defendants, most of whom are Nigerian nationals, with participating in a massive conspiracy to steal millions of dollars through a variety of fraud schemes and launder the funds through a Los Angeles-based money laundering network.

The indictment was unsealed after law enforcement authorities this morning arrested 14 defendants across the United States, with 11 of those arrests taking place in the Los Angeles region. Two defendants were already in federal custody on other charges, and one was arrested earlier this week. The remaining defendants are believed to be abroad, with most them located in Nigeria.

The indictment alleges that the 80 defendants and others used various online fraud schemes  including business email compromise (BEC) frauds, romance scams, and schemes targeting the elderly  to defraud victims out of millions of dollars. According to a criminal complaint also unsealed today, co-conspirators based in Nigeria, the United States and other countries contacted the lead defendants in the indictment  Valentine Iro, 31, of Carson, and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe, 38, of Gardena, both Nigerian citizens  for bank and money-service accounts that could receive funds fraudulently obtained from victims. Once members of the conspiracy convinced victims to send money under false pretenses, Iro and Igbokwe coordinated the receipt of funds and oversaw an extensive money-laundering network, according to the 145-page indictment.

The indictment and criminal complaint allege that Iro and Igbokwe, who were among those arrested this morning, were involved in schemes resulting in the fraudulent transfer of at least $6 million in fraudulently-obtained funds  and the overall conspiracy was responsible for the attempted theft of at least an additional $40 million.

The fraudsters targeted victims in the United States and across the globe, including individuals, small and large businesses, and law firms. Some of the victims of the conspiracy lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fraud schemes, and many were elderly.

This case is part of our ongoing efforts to protect Americans from fraudulent online schemes and to bring to justice those who prey upon American citizens and businesses, said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. Today, we have taken a major step to disrupt criminal networks that use BEC schemes, romance scams and other frauds to fleece victims. This indictment sends a message that we will identify perpetrators  no matter where they reside  and we will cut off the flow of ill-gotten gains.

Todays announcement highlights the extensive efforts that organized criminal groups will engage in to perpetrate BEC schemes that target American citizens and their hard-earned assets, said Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office. Billions of dollars are lost annually, and we urge citizens to be aware of these sophisticated financial schemes to protect themselves or their businesses from becoming unsuspecting victims. The FBI is committed to working with our partner agencies worldwide to continue to identify these cyber criminals and to dismantle their networks.

Iro and Igbokwe essentially were brokers of fraudulent bank accounts. According to the indictment, Iro and Igbokwe collected bank accounts, fielded requests for bank account information, provided that information to co-conspirators around the world, and laundered the money obtained from victims  all of this in exchange for a cut of the money stolen from victims of the various fraud schemes.

If a bank account with a specific business name was required to trick a business-victim into making a payment, Iro and Igbokwe often coordinated with money mules to open accounts that could receive funds obtained, according to court documents. In addition to making the fake business name mirror the name of a legitimate company, members of the conspiracy routinely filed fictitious business name statements with the Los Angeles County Registrar/Recorders Office that were presented to banks when the fraudulent accounts were opened.

Once a victim deposited funds into a bank account or a money services account, Iro and Igbokwe allegedly coordinated with others to further launder the funds. Members of the conspiracy sometimes wired funds to other bank accounts under their control; in other cases, they simply withdrew funds as cash or negotiable instruments such as cashiers checks.

When stolen funds were withdrawn as cash, the defendants frequently used illicit money exchangers to move funds overseas, generally avoiding transferring the funds directly through banking institutions, the indictment alleges. To do this, Iro and Igbokwe coordinated the transfer of a victims funds from a fraudulent bank account they controlled to U.S. bank accounts belonging to illicit money exchangers. Those money exchangers, in turn, used a Nigerian banking application to transfer other funds in naira (?), the currency of Nigeria, from Nigerian bank accounts they controlled to the Nigerian bank accounts specified by Iro and Igbokwe. This method was used to transfer millions of dollars to Nigerian co-conspirators without directly transferring funds overseas. The indictment alleges that Jerry Ikogho, 50, of Carson (who was taken into custody on Sunday), and Adegoke Moses Ogungbe, 34, of Fontana, were among those who served as illicit money exchangers for the conspiracy.

Each of the 80 defendants named in the indictment is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft. A number of the defendants also face substantive fraud and money laundering charges.

Additionally, Iro, Igbokwe, Ikogho, Ogungbe and three other defendants Izuchukwu Kingsley Umejesi, 30, of Los Angeles, Tityaye Marina Mansbangura, 33, of Palmdale, and Obi Madekwe, 31, of Nigeria  are charged with operating illegal money transmitting businesses. Ogungbe and Mansbangura were also among those arrested this morning, and Umejesi is a fugitive currently being sought by authorities.

Iro, Igbokwe and Chuks Eroha, 39, face additional charges for attempting to destroy their phones when the FBI executed a search warrant in July 2017. Iro also is charged with lying to the FBI in an interview conducted during the search. The complaint alleges that, when the FBI arrived to conduct the court-authorized search at Iros apartment in Carson, Iro broke his phone in half, while Igbokwe and Eroha threw phones from a bedroom window of the apartment. While Iro claimed he previously had broken the phone during an argument with his wife, the complaint details how the FBI was able to determine that the phone was operational until seconds after the FBI knocked on Iros apartment door to execute the search warrant. Eroha is believed to have fled to Nigeria shortly after the FBI executed the warrant.

The charges contained in the criminal complaint and indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.

This investigation is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office, the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, and the U.S. Department of States Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) provided substantial assistance during the investigation.

Several agencies provided support during todays takedown or during the investigation, including the United States Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Ventura County District Attorneys Office and the California Franchise Tax Board.

Many of the FBIs Legal Attachés provided assistance throughout this investigation, as did the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, and foreign authorities around the world. In particular, the FBI and U.S. Attorneys Office thank the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom and the Public Prosecutors Office of Osnabrück, Germany for their contributions.

This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Anil J. Antony and Joseph B. Woodring of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section.

The FBI in 2017 issued a report on the rise of BEC schemes, and published a recap of 2018s Operation WireWire, which was an international effort to disrupt international BEC scams.

583,"Israels attorney general has indicted Benjamin Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, in a damning blow to the prime minister as he fights for his political survival.

Avichai Mandelblit charged the 70-year-old leader on Thursday in all three major corruption cases for which he was investigated. It was the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.

In the 63-page indictment, Netanyahu was accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of pounds in luxury gifts from billionaire friends and for trading valuable favours with Israeli media and telecoms moguls for positive news coverage.

A day in which the attorney general decides to serve an indictment against a seated prime minister for serious crimes of corrupt governance is a heavy and sad day, for the Israeli public and for me personally, Mandelblit told reporters.

With no clear route to continue his premiership, Netanyahus fate has been thrown into limbo as he faces multiple explosive court cases that could drag on for years, all while under intense political pressure.

The dramatic move, the culmination of three years of inquiries, arrives at a desperately fraught time for Israels longest-serving leader. Netanyahu is scrambling to remain in power after failing to secure a clear win in two elections this year.

The prime minister has previously denied all the allegations, saying they are part of a politically orchestrated witch-hunt to oust him from office.

Responding to the indictment, a pale-faced Netanyahu said in a televised speech that the false and politically motivated charges amounted to an attempted coup against him. The public has lost trust in the legal system, he said.

Mandelblit, however, had earlier swatted aside those claims. This is not a matter of right or left. This is not a matter of politics, he said.

Netanyahu has previously stated he would not resign if indicted, and is not legally required to do so unless convicted.

The criminal case is also potentially tied to him remaining the head of the government, as some of his parliamentary allies have suggested they would back laws to grant him immunity if he can hold his seat.

Still, the seriousness of the corruption charges could significantly damage his attempts to stay in public office. Earlier this year, Israeli police recommended indictments in the three cases. Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.

The first case, known as case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts such as cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, including the Hollywood businessman Arnon Milchan and Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours.

The indictment estimated the value of the gifts at about £150,000. In return, Netanyahu helped Milchan, an Israeli who produced the film Pretty Woman, to extend his US visa, according to the charges. It was not clear what Packer received for his presents, if anything.

In case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the countrys top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.

In the third and most serious case, case 4,000, Netanyahu is accused of offering incentives worth close to £200m to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns. Charges raised against Netanyahu in case 4,000 were the only ones to involve the more damning indictment of bribery.

As well as Netanyahu, two powerful media figures in Israel tied up in the investigations, Shaul Elovich, the former owner of Bezeq, and his wife, Iris, as well as, Arnon Mozes, the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth, were also indicted for bribery. Both Elovich and Mozes deny any wrongdoing.

In a separate case not involving Netanyahu, his wife, Sara, was convicted in June of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds for lavish meals, despite having an in-house cook provided by the state.

The 60-year-old child psychologist has been a controversial partner throughout Netanyahus political career, and has also been accused by employees of mistreatment.

Shortly after Thursdays charges were announced, Netanyahus political foes rushed to call for him to step down.

Itzik Shmuli, a member of the Labor party, said the charges were the most serious indictment against an elected official in the history of the state. The main opposition Blue and White party posted a 11-year-old video of Netanyahu in which he called for then-prime minister Ehud Olmert to resign as he battled corruption allegations.

A prime minister neck deep in investigations does not have a moral and public mandate to make fateful decisions for the State of Israel, Netanyahu said in the video. Olmert stepped down before he was indicted and later served 16 months in jail.

Despite personal turmoil and a political crisis that has paralysed the country for months, the prime minister has managed to hold on. He was given a boost on Wednesday, after his political challenger, Benny Gantz, who leads Blue and White, failed to form a coalition.

Results from a general election in April provided no party with a clear majority, and a repeat national ballot in September gave a similar result. Netanyahu has twice failed to forge a coalition with allies and was fearful Gantz would end his historic run at the top.

After both men came up short, Israels president asked lawmakers on Thursday to name a new candidate, although it seems unlikely any politician will be able to cobble together a majority from such a divided parliament. If that does not happen by 11 December, an unprecedented third election will be called.

These are harsh, dark days in the annals of the state of Israel, President Reuven Rivlin said earlier on Thursday, adding that the country found itself in a miserable political situation.

Since he returned to power in 2009, Netanyahu has managed to keep his party loyal, although cracks have begun to show.

A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute, carried out last month, found that 65% of Israelis thought Netanyahu should resign as head of the Likud party if indicted.",am
584,"(Reuters) - Swedens SEB appointed a new head of banking on Friday, just months after the lender became swept up in a money laundering scandal in the region.

Jonas Ahlstrom, formerly the banks chief financial officer in the Baltics, will replace Riho Unt as leader of SEBs Baltic division with immediate effect.

I am happy that Jonas Ahlström accepted the important task of leading the Baltic division. He has a proven track record from his long career within SEB, said bank CEO Johan Torgeby.

Swedens financial watchdog has been investigating SEB over its alleged role in a Baltic money laundering scandal.

In December, the regulator said it had observed deficiencies and weaknesses at SEB and would now decide whether to impose a financial penalty.

SEB was drawn into the scandal in November, when the bank said Swedish Television (SVT) would feature it in an upcoming investigative documentary on the issue. SEB shares fell 13%.

After the SVT program aired, Torgeby told Reuters it showed nothing new, as the bank had already cut ties with the accounts it suspected of money laundering.

He also said SEB had not been used for money laundering in a systematic way.

SEB is the second-biggest bank in the Baltics behind Swedbank, a Swedish peer also under investigation for suspected money laundering in the region.

Former Baltic head Riho Unt will act as an adviser for SEBs financial crime prevention program until he leaves the bank in the summer of 2020, SEB said.",am

It appears that federal prosecutors will focus on whether Lehman executives made false comments about the health of the firm ahead of the brokerage's recent bankruptcy.

Watch CNBC's Latest Lehman Report Here

CNBC has confirmed the names of four people on the list of 12 being subpoenaed:

Dick Fuld
Erin Callan - former CFO, now with Credit Suisse
Joe Gregory  former COO
Ian Lowitt  CFO

Law enforcement sources told CNBC the investigation is still in its early stages. None of the individuals named above has been charged.

As CNBC first reported Sept. 24, multiple federal investigations at Lehman and at least 25 other firms are focusing primarily on asset valuesthat is, whether companies like Lehman were properly valuing things like mortgage-backed securities on their books, as well as the securities they sold to the public.

In a Congressional hearing last week, Fuld also faced questioning about whether he and other executives misled investors about the health of the company. Fuld acknowledged that he was wrong when he told investors in late 2007 that the worst of the crisis was over, but said, ""No one realized the extent and magnitude of these problems.""

The Justice Department is in many cases still determining which U.S. Attorney's offices will handle which cases. Three Federal grand juries are reportedly at work in New York and New Jersey alone, with other investigations of other firms ramping up across the country.

""By admitting 64 noncompetitive applicants, the university undermined the fairness and integrity of its admissions process and deprived more qualified students of the opportunity for admission,"" California State Auditor Elaine Howle said in a statement. ""The university has also failed to ensure that campuses fairly and consistently treat the thousands of prospective students who apply each year.""

In response to the audit, University of California President Michael Drake said the university system is ""committed to safeguarding the integrity of its admissions practices"" and will take prompt action to address the issues raised in auditor's report.

""I have zero tolerance on matters of integrity and will do everything I can to ensure inappropriate admissions do not happen on any of our campuses,"" Drake said. ""I sincerely appreciate the time and resources the State Auditor's office has committed to helping us improve and strengthen our admissions policies and processes.""

The audit findings come more than a year after several wealthy parents were arrested on charges of money laundering as part of the college admissions scandal dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues,"" which alleged that the parents used wealth and connections to have their children admitted to universities through means including cheating on standardized tests and bribing coaches to grant them entrance for sports they did not play.

Actress Lori Loughlin was recently sentenced to two months in federal prison for her role in this particular scheme that helped her daughters gain admission into the University of Southern California.

The University of California campuses admitted 22 of the 64 students through their student-athlete admissions processes, even though the students did not have the athletic qualifications to compete at the universities, Howle said. UC Berkley unfairly admitted 42 who were connected to staff and donors.

The report released Tuesday said these applicants were less qualified than many others for whom the campus denied admission. ""In fact, some of these applicants received the lowest possible scores on their applications,"" the report said.

Neither UC Berkeley nor UCLA have developed methodologies for how they determine which applicants to admit, according to the audit.

And inadequate training and monitoring of the staff who review applications at those schools, as well as UC San Diego, also unfairly affected applicants' chances of admission, the audit said.

""We found that staff were sometimes overly strict or overly lenient in their review of applications, thereby making the applicants' chances of admission unduly dependent on the individual staff who rated them rather than on the students' qualifications,"" Howle said.

These practices are continuing due to a lack of adequate oversight of campuses' admissions processes, the auditor said. She called for stronger standards to guarantee fairness and to detect and prevent inappropriate admissions decisions moving forward.

The auditor recommended that the office of the university system president require all campuses to verify the athletic talents of prospective student athletes and review donation records for indicators of inappropriate activity before they are admitted.

""Instead of this independent verification, the campuses largely relied on coaches' assertions that prospective student athletes were athletically qualified,"" Howle said.",am
587,"Novomatic corruption

For many years, Novomatic has been associated with possible corruption in various cases. An overview. (Image source: Pixabay by wilhei)

Anyone who deals intensively with the past 20 years of gaming history in Austria will notice two specific words in a regular context, namely Novomatic and corruption. Sometimes it was about alleged hidden party financing, sometimes about the presumed influence on the legislation. In the newest case, the appointment of Peter Sidlos to the CASAG board is even about an alleged dirty deal between the FPÖ and the manufacturer of the Novoline slot machines. Anyone who goes on a search for traces in this long period of time will notice the same names that appear in allegations and court cases and form nodes in the gigantic network of advisors, acquaintances and lobbyists. Novomatic has won many battles in connection with allegations of corruption in the past, but how white is the vest of the Austrian flagship company?

The latest cause of Novomatic and corruption is similar to 2006

In Austria, it is not exactly easy for gaming companies to gain a foothold in the state-insulated market. Casinos Austria AG towers above everything, which has a more than lucrative monopoly in both online casinos and casinos. In addition, there is even the cash cow par excellence through Austrian Lotteries, whose sales are in the billions. In the current affair about Novomatic and corruption, there is accusation that the slot machine manufacturer Peter Sidlo brought in the CASAG for the FPÖ in order to receive a license for online casinos. Interestingly, this is not the first time that this context, Internet license against favors for a political party, has been suspected and claimed.

As early as 2006, Novomatic is said to have made a major effort through lobbyists to redraft the gaming law. According to the investigations by the economic and corruption prosecutor's office at the time, the aim was to break CASAG's monopoly. Due to the influence on politics, not only should an online casino license open new markets for Novomatic, but also an entry into the lucrative lottery was planned. As an important partner, the Novoline slot machine manufacturer had a heavyweight in the Austrian economy with Telekom Austria. In future, the ruble should roll together in gaming in sectors that were previously reserved for CASAG alone.

As the WKStA suspected at the time, Novomatic is said to have paid 100,000 euros to the then finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser in 2006 to secure his help with the planned new gambling law. In addition to the ex-finance minister, the then CEO of Novomatic, Franz Wohlfahrt, and the well-known lobbyist Walter Meischberger, who will appear even more often, were involved at the time. In addition to the allegation of bribery, there were also bogus bills and illegal party financing. The investigation into Novomatic and corruption in this case lasted around seven years from 2010 to 2017 and ended with the termination of the investigation. No criminal action could be proven for all involved.

What was interesting about the termination of the investigation against Novomatic in 2017 was that the WKStA did not consider it necessary at the time to publish an official statement about the founders of the termination. According to the addendum, Wolfgang Brandstetter was the Minister of Justice at the time and had the highest authority to issue instructions. Interestingly, he was previously a defense lawyer for Franz Wohlfahrt, the CEO of Novomatic, and even represented him in this case about the Gambling Act.

Novomatic always seemed to be very interested in the lottery

In almost all cases related to possible corruption by Novomatic in the past, the focus was mostly on one of three issues. In addition to the online casino license in Austria, this also affected the good old lottery, for example. This is the way in Austria that the powerful concession, with which so-called VLTs, networked gaming machines, can be set up, which outweigh any ban on small gambling. Around the then scandal surrounding Tal Silberstein, the campaign advisor to SPÖ Chancellor Christian Kern, an interesting, then suspected connection to Novomatic boiled up.

For some years now, slot machines have been banned in some federal states and only so-called VLTs can be installed with federal licenses in these regions. With Vienna, this also affects one of the most important cities in the country. An article by Addendum suggests that as early as 2014 Novomatic, together with Tal Silberstein, might have tried to get the lucrative business with VLTs from CASAG. Novia Technologies B.V. from the Netherlands, Casinos Austria should finally exhaust and operate the maximum number of video lottery terminals and, in return, leave 15 percent of the net income to CASAG. The remaining 85 percent would have gone into Novia's pocket.

Interestingly, not only Tal Silberstein, who tried to enter the lottery business as Chancellor Advisor, was involved in the Novia company, but also ex-Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer from the SPÖ. He even founded it himself. Together with Benny Steinmetz, all three negotiated with the then CEO of CASAG, Karl Stoss, who later turned down the offer. Despite the close connection to Alfred Gusenbauer, who worked as a consultant for Novomatic for a long time and was on the board of Löwen Entertainment, the Novoline slot machine denied corruption or any other involvement in this story. The fact that two former managers of the group were also involved in Novia did not change the opinion.

Due to Karl Stoss' rejection of the deal, Tal Silberstein finally sued CASAG's Austrian lotteries. The story of the attempted entry boiled up in the wake of Tal Silberstein and Beny Steinmetz's arrest in Israel. Due to an investigation into corruption in Romania, Novomatic also had to fight such accusations in the country, there was a warrant here against Silberstein.",am
588,"The UKs Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at mining and commodity trading group Glencore.

The SFO said it is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons.

In a statement, the £30bn company added: Glencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group.

Glencore, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation.

Its share price fell by 9% on the news to close at 216.9p, a three-year low. The company is the worlds biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium.

The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africas biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007.

The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC.

Gertlers notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nations former president Joseph Kabila  who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year  has long been a source of controversy.

Gertler was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the countrys diamonds.

The Israeli was also named in a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue.

In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC.

The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are false and without any basis whatsoever, that he rejects them absolutely, and that he transacts business fairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law.

Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own.

The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as the biggest tax evasion case in United States history.

He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on trading with the enemy. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBIs most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001.

By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993.

Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the worlds biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones.

When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at £38bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since.",am
589,"Baltimore, Maryland  Joseph Kukta, age 43, of Laurel, Delaware, pleaded guilty today to federal charges of interstate transportation of stolen goods and tax evasion, in connection with his theft and resale of merchandise being shipped through a commercial mail service.

The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Kelly R. Jackson of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge John Eisert of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore.

According to his plea agreement, from 2007 through July 30, 2019, Kukta worked as a Senior Manager at the FedEx facility located in Seaford, Delaware. The facility handled all the FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery packages passing through the Delmarva Peninsula. As the most senior employee at the facility, Kukta oversaw all operational aspects of the facility and supervised over 100 employees and contractors, earning an annual salary of more than $92,000.

Kukta admitted that beginning in 2009 and continuing until June 2019, he stole packages shipped via FedEx and resold the items to Person A, currently living in Colorado, at approximately 50% of the items retail price. Kukta then transported the stolen items, using his vehicles and trailers, to Person B who resided in Maryland. Person B is Person As father. From 2012 through 2019 Person A made 275 payments to Kukta totaling more than $1.8 million for merchandise worth approximately $3.6 million that was stolen from FedEx.

As detailed in his plea agreement, Kukta stole packages that contained bulk retail goods and merchandise shipped by suppliers including Sony Electronics, Panasonic, Apple and others, intended for delivery to a Walmart Distribution Center in Smyrna, Delaware. Beginning in 2012, Kuktas theft of packages became frequent and consistent, occurring on a weekly basis in certain months. Kukta identified packages he would steal by accessing FedEx computer systems and reviewing packages that had been loaded onto a FedEx trailer awaiting delivery to the Walmart Distribution Center. Kukta selected specific packages which he believed, based on the shippers of the packages, contained high-end electronics or other merchandise of value that could be easily resold. In 2018, Kukta began to also steal packages from FedEx trailers that were loaded for delivery to a Nike Store in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

Kukta went to the FedEx facility on Sundays, holidays, or other times when employees were not at the facility, and removed the packages he previously identified from the FedEx trailers. Kukta attempted to avoid detection by turning off the lights at the facility and blocking certain surveillance cameras with cardboard boxes and other objects. Kukta loaded the stolen packages into his GMC Yukon or into vehicles operated by FedEx contractors and parked at the facility, then drove the vehicles to his rented storage unit in Seaford, where he unloaded and stored the items.

On June 5, 2019, Kukta learned that law enforcement had subpoenaed surveillance footage from the FedEx facility in Seaford. Approximately two weeks later, Kukta went to the storage unit and retrieved the remaining stolen items. Kukta sold that merchandise at an auction house in Lincoln, Delaware.

Kukta also admitted that he evaded paying income taxes on the proceeds of the scheme by failing to report that income on his annual joint federal income tax returns, causing a tax loss to the United States totaling $660,439. To conceal the income, Kukta provided false information to two banks when they questioned why he was receiving money from Company A (which was controlled by Person A). As to each bank, Kukta falsely told bank representatives that he had been selling items from his fathers estate, which he knew was false. Kukta also provided false information to the IRS during a correspondence audit, claiming that the items he had sold on eBay during 2014 were from his fathers estate, not the sale of stolen goods.

Kukta faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison for interstate transportation of stolen goods; and a maximum of five years in federal prison for tax evasion. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Blake has scheduled sentencing for June 18, 2020 at 9:15 a.m.

United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended IRS-CI and HSI for their work in the investigation. Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber and Paul A. Riley, who are prosecuting the case.",am

Former US congressman Michael Grimm has been sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion.

Last year Grimm pleaded guilty to charges that he underreported more than $1m (£600,000) in wages from a Manhattan health food restaurant.

The New York Republican, who once threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony, was re-elected in November but later resigned.

Prosecutors had pushed for a two-year prison sentence.

The fraud was ""an aberration in an otherwise unremarkable life in selfless service of his country"", his defence team wrote in court papers. Grimm is ""tremendously remorseful"", they said.

A former Marine and FBI agent, Grim was first elected to the House of the Representatives in 2010.

The fraud started after Grimm retired from the FBI. In 2007, he began running the day-to-day operations of Healthalicious.

Federal prosecutors said he failed to report the wages and provide receipts so he could avoid payroll, income and sales taxes.

SINGAPORE: Singapore has charged a director of Citadelle Corporate Services for falsifying letters related to Wirecard, the collapsed German payments firm.

R Shanmugaratnam was charged with ""wilfully and with intent to defraud"" falsifying letters from Citadelle to Wirecard representing that it held money in escrow accounts, though the accounts did not hold such balances, according to charge sheets filed by Singapore authorities on Jul 3.

READ: The man who led Wirecard into insolvency

Shanmugaratnam had fraudulently said in March 2016 that 47 million (S$76.2 million), 66.4 million and 30 million were held by Citadelle in escrow accounts as of Dec 31, 2015, according to three charge sheets.

He also falsely said in March 2017 that there was a balance of 177.5 million in an escrow account on Dec 31, 2016, according to the fourth charge sheet.

Citadelle, a business administration company, is at the heart of an investigation in the Philippines that exposed fraudulent activity at Wirecard.

Reuters was not immediately able to reach Shanmugaratnam, a 54-year-old Singapore citizen, for comment.

Munich-based Wirecard collapsed in June after its auditor EY refused to sign off on its 2019 accounts because it could not verify 1.9 billion supposedly held abroad in escrow by third-party partners.

Wirecard had initially claimed that a missing US$2.1 billion (S$2.9 billion) had been kept in two Philippine banks, which the banks said was not true.

A Filipino lawyer embroiled in the fraud told Reuters he was framed and that he opened six euro bank accounts in the name of his law firm on behalf of Citadelle.

Authorities in the Philippines said on Thursday that they were seeking to confirm the death of a former Wirecard executive Christopher Bauer, one of several people being investigated over fraud at the firm.

596,"A Florida asphalt company pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $16.6 million to resolve charges stemming from a foreign bribery probe spanning three South American countries.

Sargeant Marine Inc., which specializes in selling and transporting asphalt, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday.

The Deerfield Beach, Fla.-based company was alleged to have paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador to win contracts from state-controlled oil companies in those countries, prosecutors said. The illicit payments helped Sargeant Marine and affiliated companies earn profits of about $38 million between about 2010 and 2018, according to the Justice Department.

Sargeant Marine didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.

In Brazil, Sargeant Marine and related companies bribed executives and high-ranking government officials to win contracts to sell asphalt to Petróleo Brasileiro SA from about 2010 to 2015, resulting in about $26.5 million in profits, according to prosecutors.

Employees and agents sought to conceal payments by creating fake consulting contracts and phony invoices, prosecutors said. They wired millions of dollars from the U.S. to offshore accounts held by shell companies of middlemen, prosecutors said.

Petrobras said a spokesperson wasnt available to comment on the case.

Sargeant Marine ran a similar scheme in Venezuela between about 2012 and 2018 to purchase asphalt from Petróleos de Venezuela SA, prosecutors said, earning Sargeant Marine about $8.2 million in profits. Earlier this month, a criminal complaint was unsealed charging a former PdVSA official with conspiracy to commit money laundering in part for an alleged role in the Venezuela scheme, prosecutors said.

The company also paid bribes through an intermediary to an official working for EP Petroecuador to steer a contract with the state-controlled oil company in Ecuador, which resulted in profits of $3.2 million, prosecutors said.

PdVSA and Petroecuador didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.

597,"As the biggest corruption scandal Brazil has ever seen continues to ensnare the countrys top political and business elites, potentially damning testimony by a former ally tightens the net surrounding President Dilma Rousseff.

Former senator Delcídio do Amaral has claimed that Rousseff and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are directly involved in a widespread corruption case centered around state-owned oil giant Petrobras.

The developments are part of so-called  Operation Car Wash   which is investigating a bribery and kickback scandal involving Petrobras executives and suppliers that has cost the company billions of dollars, part of which was allegedly funneled into Rousseff and da Silvas Workers Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores  PT).

SEE ALSO: Coverage of Elites and Organized Crime

In an interview with Veja magazine, Amaral said that da Silva, popularly known as Lula, ran the scheme and that Rousseff inherited it when she took office in 2011. Dilma also knew everything, he told Veja. The difference is she pretended to have nothing to do with the case.

Amaral was arrested for alleged involvement in the Petrobras scandal in November 2015. He previously said that Rousseff and Lula were aware of the Petrobras kickback scheme in testimony to prosecutors, as part of a plea bargain (see his plea agreement here  pdf).

During his testimony to prosecutors, Amaral also accused President Rousseff of obstructing justice by appointing a sympathetic judge to the Supreme Court. Amaral said the judge blocked an arrest and facilitated the release of suspects implicated in the Petrobras case.

Rousseffs former chief of staff and current minister of education offered Amaral bribes to keep quiet about the scandal, the ex-senator told prosecutors.

Amarals testimony is the first time Rousseff has been directly linked to the scandal, the Wall Street Journal reported, while Lula has previously been detained for questioning.

Both Rousseff and Lula deny the allegations against them, while Rousseff has moved to sue Amaral for what the presidents office described as defamatory statements.

InSight Crime Analysis

Senator Amarals allegations are extremely damaging to a government that has been rocked to the core by scandal, as well as an ongoing economic crisis. However, the verdict is still out on whether the growing Petrobras corruption case has the potential to topple the presidency.

The warrant, as described by the G1 news site, accuses Maggi, 61, of crimes of obstruction of an investigation into a criminal organization in his home state.

There was never a move by me or authorized by me to act illegally in my administration's decisions or to obstruct justice, he said in a statement.

But in the decision to green-light the raids, Supreme Court Justice Luiz Fux said there was clear evidence that Maggi also tried to obstruct justice by paying bribes to a former state government secretary.

Maggi is one of Brazil's wealthiest agro-business leaders, known as the king of soybeans. He was elected senator in 2011 and named by Temer to his Cabinet post in May 2016. He has angered environmental protection groups, which accuse him of destroying Amazon forests.

Maggi is one of several Temer officials under investigation, and some have resigned in the last year over corruption allegations. The president himself was accused of corruption by the country's top prosecutor but won a vote in Congress to avoid being suspended from office pending a trial.",am

Martin Confronts Sponsorship Scandal

PRIME MINISTER Paul MARTIN, to his credit, doesn't have much experience in coping with scandal. It shows. He and his close-knit team of advisers had months to plot strategy for the release last week of auditor general Sheila Fraser's explosive report into the federal sponsorship program in Quebec. Yet Martin's carefully prepared answer to what was bound to be the first media question on the report was a misstep. Asked what he knew, back when he was Jean CHRÉTIEN 's finance minister, about the corrupt misuse of millions in sponsorship funds, Martin categorically denied he had any inkling of what was happening. ""I didn't know anything about it,"" he said, first in French and then in English, adding later for good measure, ""I have no idea what was going on here.""

Martin clearly hoped to shift attention from how much he knew then to what he was doing about it now. There's no doubt that his response to Fraser's report was his strong suit: a judicial inquiry into the whole mess, a ""special counsel"" to recover taxpayers' money improperly given away, and new whistle-blower protection for bureaucrats who expose future wrongdoing. It gave him plenty to say when asked, ""What are you going to do about this?"" But, as Martin soon learned, that's not the question at the heart of a political scandal. The one that matters is always the double-barrelled query that brought down Richard Nixon - what did he know and when did he know it?

By categorically claiming he knew nothing, the Prime Minister did the opposite of putting that classic question to rest. A blanket assertion of ignorance just wasn't going to wash. After all, Martin had not only been finance minister during the sponsorship skulduggery between 1997 and 2001 uncovered by Fraser, but also a senior Quebec Liberal. Could such an extensive abuse of the public purse in his own backyard escape his notice entirely? The opposition line of attack started from the premise that Martin must have known more than he was letting on - and failed to speak up at the time. ""Was that stony silence a result of the fact that he was so anxious to be prime minister that he turned a blind eye to the CORRUPTION that the government was involved in?"" asked Conservative MP Peter MacKay in one salvo of many lobbed Martin's way in the House.

After two days under such heavy fire, Martin called a news conference to clarify his position. This time, he patiently explained that he had suspected merely that there were administrative problems in the program - until May 2002, when the auditor general issued an earlier damning report on three sponsorship contracts. ""That is when I began to understand that what had occurred went far beyond administrative failures and involved possible criminal conduct,"" Martin said. More important, though, was his new explanation for why he knew so little until so late: Martin said he was kept in the dark by the Chrétien regime, which regarded him as a rival and a threat.

By framing the issue as an extension of his long-standing feud with Chrétien, Martin made this a scandal unlike any other. Past corruption controversies have pitted the governing party against those in opposition. This one now has the additional dimension of a rancorous split between Liberals. ""I can't recall anything like it,"" said John Wright, senior vice-president of the polling firm Ipsos-Reid Corp. ""It's the current regime verses the ancien régime. This could be a very messy affair.""

And its outcome is all the more difficult to predict. The Martin Liberals are trying to cast themselves as a new guard, sweeping away the more dubious aspects of the Chrétien era. Treasury Board President Reg Alcock, one of the key cabinet ministers assigned to forge policies in response to Fraser's findings, told Maclean's that Martin has made it clear he wants an open, no-nonsense approach to finding out what went wrong and fixing it. ""It was not,"" Alcock added pointedly, ""the instinct of the former administration.""

Putting distance between Martin and Chrétien will not be difficult. That gap has been, in many respects, the leitmotif of federal politics ever since the two Liberal alpha males clashed in the 1989-1990 leadership race won handily by Chrétien. They went on to share power, a partnership built on tension rather than real trust, until friction between them got too hot, and Martin exited cabinet in June 2002. But while Martin has an airtight case for saying he wasn't part of Chrétien's Quebec inner circle, that's not the same as establishing that he didn't have enough information to act. In fact, on the very day after Martin said he only began to suspect the worst when Fraser tabled her May 2002 report, a letter surfaced from a Liberal official who wrote to him on Feb. 7, 2002, pleading with him to get to the bottom of ""growing rumours"" about the program.

In the eruption of gleeful opposition outrage and huge headlines last week, Martin's political future was repeatedly said to be at stake. But that could turn out to be an overstatement. Even the biggest scandals - in the eyes of pundits and political insiders - often fail to register the same way with the public. On Aug. 17, 1998, Bill Clinton's agonies over the Monica Lewinsky affair seemed to reach their worst point when the U.S. president gave an equivocal apology speech that commentators quickly judged hopelessly inadequate. Americans saw things differently; Clinton's strong approval ratings held, even ticking up.

In his fall 2000 election campaign, Chrétien was dogged by reports of his involvement with tainted financial dealings around his hometown of Shawinigan, Que. With the revelation that he had repeatedly lobbied the federal Business Development Bank of Canada's president to lend money to a hotel owner in his riding, the affair threatened to take on the odour of a full-blown scandal. But, of course, voters handed Chrétien a comfortable majority anyway, and his personal popularity remained high until his retirement late last year. ""If a government is already weak, scandal has the potential to knock it off,"" said University of British Columbia political science professor Allan Tupper. ""But if a government is strong, the vote won't revolve exclusively around it.""

What's the lesson from politicians like Clinton and Chrétien, who successfully ride out the storms of scandal? One key is clearly to be well enough regarded on other fronts that the controversy doesn't become the factor that defines the politician in the popular imagination. Chrétien's reputation as an honest patriot, summed up neatly in the title of his autobiography, Straight From the Heart, was firmly embedded long before the coinage ""Shawinigate"" entered the political lexicon. Clinton's unparalleled skills as a political communicator made him a tough target, combined with the fact that Americans - long acclimatized to reports of his personal foibles - found the Lewinsky revelations less than shocking.

Martin, of course, is in a very different situation. But, like Clinton and Chrétien, he has the advantage of an established reputation that may be hard to dislodge. His long tenure as finance minister was marked by little scandal, with the exception of an embarrassing episode in March 2002 when a Martin fundraiser in Calgary was revealed to also be a paid adviser to the Finance Department on tax policy for the oil and gas industry. With only that relatively minor blemish on a clean record, Martin may be able to go into an election, which he is still widely expected to call this spring, asking Canadian voters to view him as the solution to the sort of corruption behind the sponsorship scandal, not part of the cause. ""This could in other circumstances sink a government,"" said Wright. ""But people will be asked one key ballot question: do you believe Paul Martin didn't have anything to do with it, and has taken the steps to make sure it doesn't happen again? It's an opportunity for him to build himself a platform.""

UBC's Tupper says the strength of Martin's position lies in the inquiry and reforms he announced to address Fraser's findings. ""Nobody is talking about the inadequacy of his response,"" he said. In fact, the package hasn't been the subject of much opposition attention. Liberal strategists close to the Prime Minister are staking a lot on their expectation that eventually Martin will get credit for launching a judicial inquiry and agreeing to testify before it. In so doing, they hope he'll ease those what-did-he-know-when suspicions. ""It may well be that this thing stays in the news for a long time; it may be that the inquiry turns over a lot of uncomfortable facts,"" said one senior Martin adviser. ""But at least we haven't put ourselves in a position of anyone saying we're not prepared to deal with the truth."" Especially if that truth turns out to be most damaging not to them, but to their old enemies in the Chrétien camp.

The Fraser Factor

What's behind it all?

In November 1997, a program was set up in Public Works and Government Services Canada to make the federal government more visible, especially in Quebec, by sponsoring festivals, fairs and other events.

What did the auditor general uncover?

Sheila Fraser studied the $250 million spent on sponsorships from 1997 to March 31, 2003. Perhaps her most shocking finding was that over $100 million of that was paid to Liberal-connected communications agencies in fees and commissions - which they did little or nothing to earn. She said the arrangements made with the firms that got huge payments were designed to hide ""the source of the funding and the true substance of the transactions."" As well, several Crown corporations, including Via Rail and Canada Post, were found to have gotten sponsorship money in ways the auditor general's report calls ""highly complicated and questionable.""

What's the government doing about it?

Prime Minister Paul Martin cancelled the sponsorship program on the day he took power - knowing then that Fraser's damning report was on the way. Last week, he announced an independent commission of public inquiry into the matter, under Justice John Gomery of the Quebec Superior Court. The MPs on the House public accounts committee have already begun their own hearings into the matter. As well, Martin has hired an outside lawyer to pursue firms and individuals who improperly got money in the sponsorship scam, threatening to perhaps sue them. Martin has also promised new whistle-blower protection for public servants, reforms to the way Crown corporations are run, and a review of the system of cabinet responsibility for the actions of public servants, which broke down so spectacularly in this scandal.

JOHN GEDDES

A Breakdown in Cabinet

ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS left unanswered by the auditor general's report is how cabinet ministers in Jean Chrétien's government, including then-finance minister Paul Martin, failed to figure out what was going on and take action to stop it. Maclean's asked government officials last week to explain why the two cabinet committees that appear to have been in the best position to take stock of the emerging scandal - and limit the damage - did nothing.

The cabinet committee on communications was the most obvious place for ministers to discuss swirling rumours about the sponsorship program. The committee was established in the spring of 1998, first as the ad hoc cabinet committee on government communications, and was chaired by Alfonso Gagliano, who was then public works minister and may be the central figure in the affair. Martin was not a member. Despite the fact that the committee was responsible for improving the government's image - the official aim of the sponsorships - senior Liberal sources insist Gagliano never put the controversial program on the agenda of any of its meetings. One senior Martin adviser said that omission now looks unusual and suspicious, part of a pattern of trying to prevent scrutiny of the program.

The Treasury Board ministers, a small cabinet committee that Martin served on as finance minister, was supposed to receive regular reports on follow-up actions after an internal audit of the sponsorships, conducted by the Public Works Department in the spring of 2000, first revealed serious administrative lapses. In fact, a document entitled ""Management Response: Audit of Sponsorship Process Action Plan,"" lists three separate reports on remedial actions that were supposedly delivered to the ministers between late 2000 and the spring of 2002.

Asked about the three reports by Maclean's, government officials were able to find only one that was actually delivered to the ministers. It is a table itemizing steps to clean up administration of the program, accompanied by a three-paragraph letter dated Jan. 31, 2001, and signed by Gagliano, declaring that ""the required corrective measures have been completed."" Treasury Board President Reg Alcock said he doubted Martin and other members of the committee took much notice at the time. ""You're a minister deeply involved with your own stuff and you get a report saying, 'problem identified, we've got it fixed, don't worry about it,' "" he said. ""Fundamentally, the people who were doing this didn't want to reveal it."" And it seems they succeeded in avoiding attention.

It's Tough to Be a B.C. Liberal

IT'S NO SURPRISE the Liberal sponsorship scandal rated only fleeting front-page mention in Vancouver's newspapers. News is supposed to be about the unexpected: about men biting dogs, or planes that don't land safely. ""Liberals Bribe Quebec With Your Tax Dollars"" is not news, from a B.C. point of view. As Vancouver Sun columnist Pete McMartin put it: ""Excuse me while I yawn.""

Many are heartened that the auditor general condemns such profligate pandering. And it's safe to say the next time Prime Minister Paul Martin muses about ""Western alienation,"" the $250-million sponsorship program will be raised as a root cause. One of many similar escapades, is the prevailing view. That said, Martinites should not interpret B.C.'s cynical indifference for forgiveness.

Political scandal is a B.C. speciality. Three of the past five elected B.C. premiers - Bill Bennett, Bill Vander Zalm, Glen Clark - ended up in protracted court cases after political life. A fourth, Mike Harcourt, was hounded from office by a charity bingo scandal not of his making. The current office-holder, Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell, infamously spent a night in a Hawaiian jail for drunk driving. More damaging are the police raids in December on the legislative offices of two senior aides.

Those raids should worry Martin, too. The aides, David Basi and Robert Virk, worked for provincial ministers, but they moonlighted for Martin's Liberals, helping stack ridings with instant Indo-Canadian Liberals. When details of the police investigation are finally revealed - say in the midst of a spring federal election - Team Martin could take a hit. And with the Quebec sponsorship scandal, how many of the star candidates Martin has been courting are likely to sign on to sell that mess to an alienated electorate? It just got tougher to be a federal Liberal in B.C., but, hey, no news in that.

Railways, Rifles and More

Some past scandals that rocked Ottawa:

THE PACIFIC RAILWAY: To fight the 1872 election, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald solicited $360,000 from railway promoters such as Sir Hugh Allan, later rewarded with the contract to build the Pacific railway. The scandal broke the next year when the Liberal opposition exposed the deal through damning letters and telegrams. One was from Macdonald to railway lawyer and politician J.J.C. Abbott, pleading that he ""must have another $10,000."" In October 1873, his government resigned, although Macdonald later came back to win the 1878 election.

THE ROSS RIFLE: During the First World War, Sam Hughes, the minister of the militia, was a great proponent of the Canadian-made Ross rifle. Soldiers, however, hated it because of its heavy weight, size and constant jamming problems. The government also faced corruption accusations over the awarding of munitions contracts, as well as complaints of rotten rations and other substandard equipment. In 1916, Ottawa bowed to pressure and replaced the Ross with the British-made Lee-Enfield. A few months later, Prime Minister Robert Borden fired Hughes.

SINCLAIR STEVENS: Amid charges he used his public office to further personal business interests, Brian Mulroney's minister of regional industrial expansion resigned in 1986. A subsequent judicial inquiry heard about dealings between Stevens' ""blind trust"" company and firms that had received millions in development grants from his department. In December 1987, Stevens was found to have violated conflict of interest guidelines on 14 occasions. The drama was only one in a series of Mulroney government scandals.

He said talks were held at Pilot's residence and subsequently, he had alerted Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot about the conspiracy to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan.

""I had a talk with Sachinji. He offered me money to join the BJP, but I refused, saying I will not join the saffron party,"" Malinga told reporters here.

He did not disclose the amount that he was allegedly offered to join the saffron party. Asked if it was between Rs 30 crore and Rs 35 crore, Malinga said he was offered the ""going rate"".

He said he would not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) even after resigning as an MLA.

""How will I face the people of my area? What will I tell them?"" he asked.

WHO WERE RAIDED

Ratan Kant Sharma

Mayank Sharma Enterprises, with alleged links to Ashok Gehlots son Vaibhav Gehlot, was raided by the Income Tax Department. At least eight locations linked to Mayank Sharma Enterprises in Mumbai were searched by I-T Department who said, The source of investment in the same remains to be verified.

The director of the entity, Ratan Kant Sharma, is said to be a close associate of Vaibhav Gehlot, the BJP has alleged.

The Enforcement Directorate suspects that Ratan Kant Sharma had allegedly remitted large amounts from overseas transactions, including Rs 96.7 crore from Mauritius.

Ratan Kant Sharma, Director of Triton Hotels owned by Mayank Sharma Enterprises, also has stakes in Jaipurs Fairmount Hotel and is believed to be a business partner of Vaibhav Gehlot.

ED officials said a team visited the Fairmount Hotel in Jaipur today in connection with a money laundering case. Employees of the hotel were also questioned by the ED.

Sunil Kothari

Sunil Kothari, Managing Director of Om Metals, reportedly has close links with Ashok Gehlots relatives, sources said.

The company is involved in several business activities like hotels, hydropower projects, metal and auto sectors, I-T Department said, adding, It is suspected to have invested unaccounted income generated from these activities into real estate.

The I-T Department is in possession of the receipts of allegedly dubious transactions of the firm linked to Sunil Kothari, they said.

These said transactions allegedly were carried out through the hawala network, the I-T Department suspects and is probing to find if these transactions were used for political gains.

The department is also probing if there was any tax evasion by the firm and individuals linked to the transactions.

Searches were conducted at atleast three premises of Om Metals in Delhis posh Sainik Farm area. The I-T team of 8-10 officials came in around 8 am. We dont know what is happening inside. There are two kothis owned by Om Metals here, one of the guards told the media.

Rajiv Arora

The I-T Department raided premises owned by Rajeev Arora, one of the founders of Amrapali Jewels and vice-president of the Rajasthan Congress, in Jaipur and Kota. The residence of Arora, who is reportedly a close aide of Ashok Gehlot, was raided in Jaipurs Ashok Nagar along with his corporate office by officials today.

Suspicious transactions, including those overseas, are being probed by the I-T Department who suspect the money was used for gaining political mileage.

Officials said that Amrapali Jewels, engaged in the business of trading of silver, gold jewellery and antique silver articles, has associate enterprises in various countries like the US and the UK, as well as properties and bank accounts in these countries.

The main allegation against the group is that a substantial part of its silver jewellery business is carried out outside the regular books of accounts, the statement read.

604,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudans Omar al-Bashir, facing a possible appearance before the international war crimes tribunal, defied rebellions, economic crises and the hostility of the West before being overthrown as president by the military last year.

Bashir, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, is currently in Khartoums Kober prison, where he had locked up his opponents while in office.

On Tuesday, the transitional government that succeeded Bashir and rebel groups in Darfur that had opposed him agreed that all five Sudanese suspects wanted by the International Criminal Court over Darfur should face justice.

Bashir is one of those five suspects, wanted by the Hague-based ICC for war crimes. He says the tribunals allegations are part of a Western conspiracy. His lawyer said he refuses to have any dealings with what he calls a political court.

During his 30 years in power, Bashir was a master at playing rival factions among security services, the military, Islamists and armed tribes off against each other.

But he underestimated the anger of young Sudanese men and women demanding an end to economic hardship.

Bashir ultimately faced almost daily defiance in towns and cities across Sudan despite a crackdown by security forces using tear gas and sometimes live ammunition, in which dozens of people were killed.

Addressing soldiers in January 2019, Bashir warned the rats to go back to their holes and said he would move aside only for another army officer or at the ballot box.

They said they want the army to take power. Thats no problem. If someone comes in wearing khaki, we have no objection, Bashir, wearing his military uniform, told soldiers at a base in Atbara, the northern city where protests erupted.

Bashir went on to declare a state of emergency that expanded police powers and banned unlicensed public gatherings.

Bashir, 76, has always been a divisive figure.

After taking office in what was then Africas largest country, he fought a protracted civil war with southern rebels which ended with the secession of South Sudan in 2011, and the loss of more than 70 percent of Sudans oil.

Sudan has suffered prolonged periods of isolation since 1993, when the United States added Bashirs government to its list of terrorism sponsors for harboring Islamist militants. Washington followed up with sanctions four years later.

The protests in Sudan that ousted Bashir followed the success of demonstrations in Algeria that forced out long-ruling President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

In the months before protests began in Sudan, people had already been struggling to makes ends meet.

The government had hoped for quick financial support from wealthy Gulf Arab allies after Bashir sent troops to Yemen as part of a Saudi-led alliance fighting an Iranian-backed movement, but help was slow to arrive.

The trigger for the wave of protests was a government attempt to introduce unsubsidized bread. The demonstrations quickly turned political, demanding Bashir step down.

HUMBLE BEGINNINGS

Bashir was born on Jan. 1, 1944 to a poor farming family in Hosh Bannaga, a small village consisting mainly of mud houses and dusty streets on the eastern bank of the Nile River, 150 km (90 miles) north of the capital Khartoum.

He has often played up his humble beginnings. He tells the story of how he broke a tooth while carrying concrete at a construction site where he worked as a student to pay for his education.

Bashir said he refused a silver tooth implant when he joined the military because he wanted to remember that incident whenever he looked in the mirror.

As a young officer in the parachute regiment, he joined the armed wing of the Islamist Movement, a group that penetrated deep into Sudans institutions.

The head of the junta that seized power in 1989, Bashir dissolved the military council in 1993 and ruled with an iron fist.

But it was Bashirs response to the insurgency in the western Darfur region that has come to define his legacy.

Facing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over the death of an estimated 300,000 people in Darfur, Bashir held on to power as a shield against a trial similar to that of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

Defying the ICC, Bashir continued to visit friendly foreign states as he tried to show he had not been cowed by the international arrest warrant.

As protests against him mounted, Bashir had counted on support from the security establishment he had nurtured for three decades to see him through.

606,"One of Hong Kongs most strident pro-democracy figures has been arrested and the offices of the newspaper he owns searched by police in a stark escalation by authorities enforcing a new national security law brought in by Beijing.

The raid on Apple Daily, Hong Kongs largest pro-democracy daily paper, and arrest of Jimmy Lai and other senior executives were condemned by activists and journalists, who said they marked the day press freedom officially died.

Apple Dailys publisher, Next Digital Media, said it was furious about the raid and arrests. It warned that press freedom was hanging by a thread but said its staff remained committed to defending it.

Lai, a 71-year-old media tycoon and outspoken supporter of Hong Kongs pro-democracy movement, was arrested alongside six others including his son on Monday morning on suspicion of collusion with foreign forces and conspiracy to commit fraud.

In a separate incident the pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow was also arrested under the new law, her fellow activist Nathan Law said.

Hong Kong police said nine men and one woman, aged between 23 and 72, had been arrested.

Hundreds of police descended on the Apple Daily building in an unprecedented hours-long raid, which was live-streamed by dozens of the papers staff.

Tell your colleagues to keep their hands off until our lawyers check the warrant, the editor-in-chief, Ryan Law Wai-kwong, told police. Staff were ordered to produce ID. Midway through the raid a handcuffed Lai was marched through the newsroom.

Thousands watched the streams, which appeared to contradict police claims that news materials would not be targeted, as officers casually rifled through papers on journalists desks. Boxes of documents were confiscated.

Later, police barred news organisations including Reuters, Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and the public broadcaster RTHK from attending a press conference about the search.

The Hong Kong journalist association head, Chris Yeung, said the raid was horrendous. I think in some third-world countries there has been this kind of press freedom suppression, I just didnt expect it to be in Hong Kong, he told media.

Next Digital accused police of abusing their power and authorities of breaching press freedom through intimidation and creating an atmosphere of white fear.

The arrest of Lai, while not unexpected, has alarmed the city, which has been on edge after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law outlawing sedition and secessionist activities, and foreign collusion.

Lai, who also holds UK citizenship, is the most high-profile figure detained under the law. If charged and convicted, he could face potential sentences of three to 10 years in prison  or up to life for an offence of a grave nature.

In 2019 state media labelled him one of a new Gang of Four conspiring against Beijing. He is already facing several charges over involvement in last years pro-democracy protests, and he was one of 25 people charged on Friday over attending a Tiananmen Square massacre vigil in June.

A report in hawkish Chinese state media mouthpiece the Global Times labelled Lai a modern-day traitor and suggested he was unlikely to receive bail and would face heavy penalties.

Hong Kong journalists have repeatedly warned that the law would have a chilling affect on local media.

The activist and legislator Eddie Chu Hoi-dick accused the Chinese Communist party of wanting to close Apple Daily, and said Lais arrest was the first step of [a] HK media blackout.

Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator and a former journalist, said she was more surprised by the raid than the arrest. This is just so drastic and blatant, she told the Guardian.

Keith Richburg, a veteran correspondent and now head of Hong Kong Universitys media school, said the raid and arrests were outrageous. I think you can say that is the day press freedom officially died, and it didnt die a natural death. It was killed by Beijing and it was killed by Carrie Lam and Hong Kong police, he said.

The police operation marked the first time the law has been used against media in Hong Kong, which has historically had a high level of press freedom. Last month the New York Times announced it was moving part of its Hong Kong bureau to South Korea.

Several outlets have complained of foreign journalist visas not being renewed. On Monday the Standard news website reported that the immigration department had established a national security unit to vet sensitive visa applications, including from journalists.

Chinese and Hong Kong officials had promised the security law would not impinge on the citys civil freedoms, including its independent press. Todays police action upends those assurances, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong said in a statement.

Benedict Rogers, a co-founder and the chair of Hong Kong Watch, said: To arrest one of the most moderate, peaceful and internationally respected voices for democracy in Hong Kong  sends the message that no one is safe in Hong Kong unless they stay completely silent and do exactly as Xi Jinpings brutal regime says.

There was some speculation that the arrests were retaliation for US sanctions against senior Hong Kong officials, including Lam. The accusations against Lai have been at least partly driven by his meetings with and support from senior US figures including the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.

In response to the US sanctions, Chinas foreign ministry on Monday said that it would be placing sanctions on 11 US officials and lawmakers. A foreign ministry spokesman condemned the US for its blatant interference in Chinas internal affairs.

On Monday afternoon the stock price of Next Digital, which is owned by Lai, rose more than 300% after some analysts reportedly said they would buy in protest against his arrest.",nam
607,"In 2010, New Delhi witnessed the Commonwealth Games (CWG) scam, one of the major Indian scams, involving a pilferage of around Rs 70,000 crore. It was estimated that only half of the allotted amount was spent on Indian sportspersons. The athletes were allegedly asked to shift to shabby apartments from the ones that were allotted to them by the authorities. Reports of the Central Vigilance Commission, in-charge of investigation of the CWG scam, revealed that Suresh Kalmadi, the Chairman of the organising committee of the Games, offered a contract of Rs 141 crore to Swiss Timings for its timing equipment which was unnecessarily high by Rs 95 crore. All the accused, including Kalmadi, were charged of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery for purpose of cheating and were also charged under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Introduced back in 1930, Commonwealth Games is an internationally popular multi-sport event that engages athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations.

608,"(Yicai Global) April 29 -- Pinduoduo reported 18 criminal cases to the authorities since the start of the year, with 28 people detained by police, a news outlet under the Peoples Daily reported today, citing a statement from the Chinese e-commerce platform. Of the 28, three staffers were arrested, while the company fired six others.

In China, public security organs can take three other measures in addition to detention and arrest. First, criminal suspects and defendants who have not been detained or arrested can be questioned at designated locations. Second, they must provide a guarantor or pay bail to ensure they dont evade or obstruct the investigation, prosecution or trial. And third, the suspects are put under home surveillance.

The head of the Pinduoduos integrity and legal affairs division, whose name was not revealed, said that the company has always adopted a zero-tolerance attitude toward employees involved in commercial bribery.
Sellers and suppliers who bribe or try to bribe its staff, as well as platform businesses that collude with criminal gangs to make counterfeit and substandard products, or are involved in overseas gambling and money laundering, or other illegal acts will be kicked off the platform, the official added.

Pinduoduo called on Chinas major internet platforms to set up an anti-commercial bribery alliance to share databases of former employees and suppliers suspected of law-breaking to maintain an honest society, as advocated by the government.

Another Chinese internet firm Meituan Dianping said yesterday that it has dealt with 12 criminal cases since January, with 33 people handed over to the authorities.

Chinas internet companies have been pushing ahead with anti-corruption efforts in recent years amid the failure of corporate governance and internal staff building to keep up with their rapid expansion. In January to July last year, eight firms reported more than 110 cases involving over 220 people, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported. Both figures were more than 11 times those of 2015.",am
609,"(Reuters) - U.S. television presenter Ed Henry denied allegations of sexual misconduct after being fired by Fox News over claims of willful sexual misconduct involving a co-worker from years ago.

The cable news network owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp FOXA.O said on Wednesday it had dismissed the co-presenter of weekday news program ""America's Newsroom"" after receiving a complaint on June 25 from the lawyer of a former employee which prompted the network to retain an outside law firm to investigate.

Henry was suspended on the day of the complaint and was fired based on investigative findings, according to an internal memo that Fox News provided Reuters.

""Ed Henry denies the allegations referenced in the Fox announcement and is confident that he will be vindicated after a full hearing in an appropriate forum,"" Henry tweeted here on Wednesday, quoting his lawyer Catherine Foti.

610,"Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay -- once one of the most powerful and feared Republicans in Congress -- was convicted Wednesday on charges he illegally funneled corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002, which could send him to prison for decades.

Jurors deliberated for 19 hours before returning guilty verdicts on charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in a scheme to illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. He faces up to life in prison on the money laundering charge, although prosecutors haven't yet recommended a sentence.

After the verdicts were read, DeLay hugged his daughter, Danielle, and his wife, Christine. DeLay whispered into his daughter's ear that he couldn't get a fair trial in Austin. DeLay had unsuccessfully tried to get the trial moved out of Austin, the most liberal city in one of the most Republican states

DeLay's lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said they planned to appeal the verdict.

""This is an abuse of power. It's a miscarriage of justice, and I still maintain that I am innocent. The criminalization of politics undermines our very system and I'm very disappointed in the outcome,"" DeLay told reporters outside the courtroom.

He remains free on bond, and several witnesses were expected to be called during the punishment phase of his trial, tentatively scheduled to begin on Dec. 20.

Prosecutors said DeLay, who once held the No. 2 job in the House of Representatives and whose tough tactics earned him the nickname ""the Hammer,"" used his political action committee to illegally channel $190,000 in corporate donations into 2002 Texas legislative races through a money swap.

DeLay and his attorneys maintained the former Houston-area congressman did nothing wrong as no corporate funds went to Texas candidates and the money swap was legal.

The verdict came after a three-week trial in which prosecutors presented more than 30 witnesses and volumes of e-mails and other documents. DeLay's attorneys presented five witnesses.

""This case is a message from the citizens of the state of Texas that the public officials they elect to represent them must do so honestly and ethically, and if not, they'll be held accountable,"" Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg said after the verdict.

Lehmberg said prosecutors will decide in the next few weeks what sentence they will recommend in the case to Senior Judge Pat Priest.

DeLay chose Priest to sentence him rather than the jury. He faces five years to life in prison on the money laundering charge and two to 20 years on the conspiracy charge. He also would be eligible for probation.

Jurors, who left the courthouse right after the verdict was read, declined to comment to reporters, only saying that it had been a tough decision for them to make.

The jury had sent numerous notes to Priest during its deliberations, which began on Monday. Many of the notes asked various legal questions that at one point had prompted the judge to say the panel wasn't on the right track. But at the end of Tuesday, jurors had indicated they were making progress.

Prosecutors said DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based PAC to send $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee, or RNC. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under Texas law, corporate money can't go directly to political campaigns.

Prosecutors claim the money helped Republicans take control of the Texas House. That enabled the GOP majority to push through a Delay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Texas Republicans to Congress in 2004 -- and strengthened DeLay's political power.

DeLay's attorneys argued the money swap resulted in the seven candidates getting donations from individuals, which they could legally use in Texas.

They also said DeLay only lent his name to the PAC and had little involvement in how it was run. Prosecutors, who presented mostly circumstantial evidence, didn't prove he committed a crime, they said.

DeLay contended the charges against him were a political vendetta by Ronnie Earle, the former Democratic Travis County district attorney who originally brought the case and is now retired.

Lehmberg, who replaced Earle, said the trial was not about criminalizing politics.

""This was about holding public officials accountable, that no one is above the law and all persons have to abide by the law, no matter how powerful or lofty the position he or she might hold,"" she said.

Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for Public Justice, a liberal watchdog group whose complaints with the Travis County District Attorney's Office helped lead to the investigation of DeLay's PAC, said he was pleased by the verdict.

""We can't undo the 2002 election, but a jury wisely acted to hold DeLay accountable for conspiring to steal it.""

The 2005 criminal charges in Texas, as well as a separate federal investigation of DeLay's ties to disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, ended his 22-year political career representing suburban Houston. The Justice Department probe into DeLay's ties to Abramoff ended without any charges filed against DeLay.

Ellis and Colyandro, who face lesser charges, will be tried later.

Except for a 2009 appearance on ABC's hit television show ""Dancing With the Stars,"" DeLay has been out of the spotlight since resigning from Congress in 2006. He now runs a consulting firm based in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land.",am
611,"Mexico's former defence secretary helped smuggle thousands of kilograms of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States in exchange for bribes, according to court documents unsealed Friday.

Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, 72, acted on behalf of the H-2 cartel while defence secretary from 2012 to 2018 under then-president Enrique Peña Nieto, authorities said.

Thousands of intercepted Blackberry messages show the general ensured military operations were not conducted against the cartel and that operations were initiated against rivals, according to prosecutors. Cienfuegos allegedly introduced cartel leaders to other corrupt Mexican officials.

Cienfuegos is accused of alerting cartel leaders to a U.S. law enforcement investigation into its operations and the use of co-operating witnesses and informants, which resulted in the murder of a member of the cartel who leaders incorrectly believed was assisting U.S. law enforcement authorities.

Intercepted communications between Cienfuegos and a senior cartel leader discussed the general's historical assistance to another drug-trafficking organization, as well as communications in which the defendant is identified by name, title and photograph as the Mexican government official assisting the H-2 cartel.

Cienfuegos was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York on Aug. 14, 2019.

He was arrested Thursday upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport. A senior Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to give details of the case, said Cienfuegos was arrested with family members who were released, and he was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center.

Cienfuegos was scheduled to make an initial appearance later Friday in federal court in Los Angeles, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said.

He was expected to be eventually transferred to New York, where his case is being handled.

2nd major arrest of a Mexican official

While Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador talks daily about corruption being at the root of all of Mexico's problems, the biggest catches of his term have so far come across the border in the United States.

Cienfuegos is the highest-ranking former cabinet official arrested since top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna was taken in to custody in Texas in 2019.

The defence secretary post positioned Cienfuegos as a critical figure in efforts by Mexico and its allies to combat drug trafficking.

U.S. prosecutors allege Garcia Luna took tens of millions of dollars in bribes to protect Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman's Sinaloa cartel. He had served as Mexico's Secretary of Public Security from 2006 to 2012 under then-president Felipe Calderón. He pleaded not guilty earlier this month to drug-trafficking charges in a federal court in New York.

Mexican president tees off on previous administration

The arrest of Cienfuegos is a tough blow for Mexico, where the army and navy are some of the few remaining respected public institutions.

López Obrador has vowed to go after corruption and lawbreaking under past administrations, but he has relied more heavily on the army  and given it more tasks, ranging from building infrastructure projects to distributing medical supplies  than any other president in recent history.

On Friday, López Obrador said Cienfuegos's arrest was ""regrettable.""

He said there was no drug-related investigation of Cienfuegos in Mexico and that Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena, told him two weeks ago that there was talk of an investigation involving Cienfuegos, but there was nothing specific.

""This is an unmistakable example of the decomposition of the government, of how civil service was degrading the government service during the neo-liberal period,"" López Obrador said.

A Colombian drug trafficker testified early last year at Guzman's U.S. trial that the kingpin had boasted about paying a $100 million US bribe to Peña Nieto to call off the hunt for him. Peña Nieto's spokesperson denied the accusation.",am
612,"Paraguayan authorities have announced historic sanctions against a major Brazilian bank in the latest case of Latin American governments cracking down on financial institutions that do not comply with anti-money laundering regulation.

On October 29, Paraguays Ultima Hora announced that the Central Bank of Paraguay (Banco Central del Paraguay  BCP) had imposed a $9.64 million fine on Brazils Banco Itaú for breaking anti-money laundering regulations last August 2020.

The bank had allegedly failed to report suspicious transactions to the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money or Property Laundering (Secretaría de Prevención de Lavado de Dinero o Bienes  SEPRELED), thereby violating Article 19 of Paraguays Law No. 1015 concerning money laundering.

This was the largest fine related to money laundering in Paraguayan history, Diego Marcet, general director of SEPRELEDs legal department told Radio Universo, adding that a lack of adherence to anti-money laundering regulations was systemic.

In response, Banco Itaús stated the fine was due to a specific incident on August 21 that the bank had reported itself and that it had a strict and rigorous money laundering prevention policy, according to news website RDN. The bank reportedly already lost its first appeal on September 9 but it may do so again.

And this is but the latest fine Banco Itaú has faced of late. In October 2019, Brazils Operation Car Wash (Lava Jato) anti-corruption probe found Banco Itaú had enabled $16.4 million worth of illegal transactions used for the payment of bribes. This was followed one month later by the city of São Paolo fining Itaú a gargantuan $662 million for evading state taxes. And in June 2019, the bank agreed to return $13.1 million to the 4.7 million customers it over-charged from 2008 to 2018, as well as paying a penalty of nearly $2 million.

InSight Crime Analysis

Big banks in Latin America have wilfully ignored anti-money laundering controls while profiting from illicit flows. Yet the surprising sanctioning of Banco Itaú by Paraguayan authorities may mean such impunity is finally beginning to be challenged.

In 2019, Paraguay was named in one index as the country with the second-highest risk of money laundering in Latin America. That same year, Brazilian authorities requested the extradition of former Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes (2013-2018) to face money laundering charges related to the Odebrecht scandal.

Paraguays role as South Americas main provider of both marijuana and counterfeit goods mean there is plenty of dirty money swirling around, while endemic police corruption, struggling judicial systems and the penetration of Brazilian organized crime mean the state lacks any meaningful enforcement capacity of even basic illegal activities, let alone more sophisticated financial crimes.

Yet this case may highlight tentative progress in Paraguay, with the aforementioned index noting a slight decrease in Paraguays vulnerability since 2017. This is perhaps due to a delayed effect of important steps taken in 2015 to combat the problem, such as the creation of an anti-money laundering unit within the Attorney Generals Office.

Paraguayan law enforcement are heavily dependent on Brazilian intelligence to conduct raids, making the fining of Banco Itaú particularly interesting. Investigating money laundering within an international bank is a complex matter yet Brazilian authorities appear not to have played a role with Itaú not having been sanctioned in Brazil on the same charges.

Brazilian banks became enmeshed in their own scandals during the Lava Jato investigation, which discovered that the countrys five biggest banks, including Itaú, had allowed the laundering of some $325 million used to pay bribes. Paraguayan financial institutions, particularly currency exchanges, have also laundered money for Brazilian criminal groups.

The most famous scandal related to banks laundering criminal proceeds came in 2012 when HSBC was famously fined $1.9 billion in the United States and $27.5 million in Mexico for negligently laundering over $881 million for Mexican and Colombian cartels.

But hopes the record sanctions would lead to substantive change never transpired. In September 2020, a new investigation by Connectas and Quinto Elemento Lab revealed that a former HSBC official, who had allegedly enabled corrupt clients to maintain their bank accounts in violation of the banks regulations, was now a senior anti-money laundering official in the Mexican government.",am

The Jus­tice De­part­ments years-long bat­tle with In­di­v­ior has ar­rived at a rare place: the jail­ing of a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ec­u­tive.

A US dis­trict court sen­tenced long-run­ning In­di­v­ior CEO Shaun Thax­ter to 6 months in fed­er­al prison for his role in com­pa­ny ef­forts to mis­lead a ma­jor health­care provider about the safe­ty and abus­abil­i­ty of their opi­oid ad­dic­tion drug Sub­ox­one, which gen­er­at­ed bil­lions in rev­enue over the last decade. Thax­ter joins for­mer In­sys CEO John Kapoor as one of the on­ly two ex­ec­u­tives to face prison time for their roles in the opi­oid epi­dem­ic.

Thax­ter had been for­mal­ly charged with one count of mis­de­meanor in­for­ma­tion. He al­so owes $100,000 and has to for­feit $500,000.

The Jus­tice De­part­ment has broad­ly ac­cused the British-based In­di­v­ior of de­vel­op­ing a film ver­sion of its oral ad­dic­tion med Sub­ox­one in 2007, as the oral ver­sion was be­com­ing gener­ic, and then false­ly brand­ing it as less like­ly to be abused and less like­ly to be di­vert­ed for recre­ation­al use than its com­peti­tors. Sub­ox­one con­tains buprenor­phine, a pow­er­ful and ad­dic­tive opi­oid that can be used to help re­cov­er­ing pa­tients avoid with­draw­al.

Two months lat­er, MassHealth an­nounced it would pro­vide ac­cess to Sub­ox­one Film for Med­ic­aid pa­tients with chil­dren un­der the age of six, the DOJ said.

In­di­v­iors for­mer par­ent com­pa­ny, RB Group, has al­ready paid $1.4 bil­lion to set­tle claims from the gov­ern­ment, while an In­di­v­ior sub­sidiary, In­di­v­ior So­lu­tions, plead­ed guilty to felony charges. Along with the main com­pa­ny, they agreed to pay $600 mil­lion in dam­ages.

While Thax­ter served for years as In­di­v­iors chief ex­ec­u­tive, he was in a po­si­tion to en­sure that doc­tors, pa­tients, and in­sur­ers were dealt with hon­est­ly, act­ing US At­tor­ney Daniel Bubar said in a state­ment. In­stead, Thax­ter failed to pre­vent ef­forts to build prof­its through mis­lead­ing safe­ty claims, which led to mil­lions of dol­lars in ill-got­ten gains for In­di­v­ior.

615,"PORTLAND, Ore.Portland resident Isaiah Holt, 31, pleaded guilty today to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, money laundering, and illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Holt is a licensed electrician, motivational speaker, and fitness coach.

According to court documents, beginning in July 2016 and continuing until his arrest in April 2018, Holt used his association with a licensed marijuana producer in Portland to divert state-legal marijuana into the black market. Holt sold marijuana in-person to out-of-state customers traveling to Oregon and by mail to remote customers using the U.S. Postal Service.

Holt recruited two individuals to use their bank accounts to receive and launder proceeds of his marijuana sales. Out-of-state customers would send Holt mailing addresses and deposit payments into bank accounts in the names of various third-party associates. Holt would then direct these associates to withdraw the money from their accounts on his behalf. He used the cash to purchase multiple vehicles that he registered in his girlfriend and co-defendants name, Marjorie Livington. Holt also directed Livingston, 39, of Portland, to purchase and register firearms for him using her name.

On April 4, 2018, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) obtained and executed a search warrant on Holt and Livingstons Northeast Portland residence. Agents found 11.5 grams of cocaine and nearly $2,000 in cash on Holts person and drug packaging materials, shipping labels, 14 pounds of marijuana, three firearms, and $46,100 in cash in the residence.

After his arrest and federal indictment, Holt continued to distribute cocaine. From April to August 2019, law enforcement conducted three controlled purchases of cocaine from Holt. While on his way to a fourth pre-arranged buy, Holt eluded a marked police car and later fled on foot, discarding approximately two ounces of cocaine along the way. In total, law enforcement purchased or recovered from Holt approximately 158 grams of cocaine during these purchases.

Conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $1 million fine, and three years supervised release. Money laundering is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $500,000 fine or twice the value of property involved, and three years supervised release. Illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years supervised release.

Holt will be sentenced on March 9, 2020 by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Michael W. Mosman.

As part of his plea agreement, Holt has agreed to forfeit one Smith & Wesson .40 caliber pistol, one Ruger AR-556 5.56 caliber rifle, one Taurus 9mm pistol, all seized ammunition, and $46,100 in cash. He has also agreed to pay $32,600 to satisfy a forfeiture money judgement.

Livingston was indicted alongside Holt for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and making false statements during the purchase of a firearm. She is scheduled to plead guilty to the firearms charge on December 16, 2019.

The case was investigated by ATF, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Portland Police Bureau. It is being prosecuted by Julia Jarrett and Leah Bolstad, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.

The case was brought as part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). PSN is the centerpiece of the Department of Justices violent crime reduction efforts. PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime. Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.

616,"The Paradise Papers leak shows that Sauat Mynbayev, a key in Kazakhstans energy sector, could have conspired to hide millions in offshore havens.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists leaked to the public millions of documents held at the offshore law firm Appleby, which included information related to former energy minister and current head of the Kazakh national oil and gas company, Sauat Mynbayev.

The so-called Paradise Papers show that Mynbayev was a shareholder in Meridian Capital Ltd. since its incorporation in Bermuda in 2002. Since then, an article on Eurasianet shows, Mynbayevs career and Meridians fortunes seemed to improve at a similar pace. In 2005, according to documents of the 2015 Swiss Leak, Meridian was estimated to be worth around $1.2 billion. The following year, its assets had grown to $3 billion. Mynbayev in the meantime had been appointed to the post of deputy prime minister first, and then promoted to head the Samruk-Kazyna sovereign wealth fund. After another sudden career jump, in 2007 he was put at the highest ministerial post dealing with energy issues. Since 2013, Mynbayev has served as the chairman of the national oil and gas company Kazmunaigas.

Immediately after the leak, government sources and Kazmunaigas dismissed the claims. Only a few days after, Mynbayev finally confirmed that he had been a shareholder for several years. His share amounted to 18.75 percent in 2006, but could have been even higher in previous years. Mynbayev also added that he never concealed his ownership of Meridian in his tax returns and that he had left the company a few years ago. In retrospect, distant ties between Meridian and Mynbayev had already been exposed two years ago in a local investigative outlet.

The other owners all shared a similar background: they were all managers or shareholders in one of Kazakhstans largest banks, Kazkommertsbank. Mynbayev himself had been a deputy chairman of Kazkommertsbank in 1993-1995. After some restructuring and rebranding, Kazkommertsbank, now Qazkom, has become part of Halyk Bank, owned by president Nursultan Nazarbayevs daughter and her husband.

Mynbayev and some of his Meridian associates were also linked to another offshore scheme, concerning the ownership of TengizTransGaz, the largest private fleet of oil and gas rail cargo. TengizTransGaz is owned by Dutch company TTG Group, in turn owned by another Dutch company, whose mother company is based in Cyprus. Journalists at the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project were unable to trace the ultimate owner of the company. Owning this additional segment of the oil industry would have given Mynbayev a clear vantage point against any competitor. TengizTransGazs main customer was the consortium operating the Tengiz oilfield, for decades the largest producer in Kazakhstan.

Unlike several other figures controlling the oil sector in Kazakhstan, Mynbayev originates from Taldykorgan, near Almaty, thousands of miles away from the rich oil fields around the Caspian Sea. His profile was closer to the financial elites and became closely linked to a rampant figure in Kazakhstans oil sector, according to Maurizio Totaro, PhD Fellow at University of Ghent, whose work focuses on the Kazakhstani oil region of Mangystau.

Mynbayev is not from western Kazakhstan, but the director of Meridian Petroleum [one of Meridian Capitals subsidiaries], Baltabek Kuandykov, is from Makat, in the Atyrau oblast. Kuandykov is not only a geologist by training, but has been very much involved in the government in the first half of the 1990s. With his knowledge, both technical and political, Kuandykov could have been one of the anchors of Meridian to the oil regions, Totaro told The Diplomat.

Despite a potential conflict of interests, the partnership between Meridian and Kazkommertsbank thrived in the first decade of this century. Meridian and its two Cayman Island-registered subsidiaries took out loans from Kazkommertsbank to implement their diversified business portfolio, which ranged from oil and gas to real estate. Below Meridian Capital CIS Fund and Meridian Capital International Fund were a vast range of companies whose ownership structure looked like a typical offshore Russian doll network.

One of Meridians most famous exploits was the sale of the Galereya shopping mall in St. Petersburg to financial giant Morgan Stanley in 2012 for $1.1 billion. The leaked documents show that the company owns businesses in Kazakhstan and around the world, but the name Meridian is nowhere to be found in shareholding declarations.

Importantly, Mynbayev had always been regarded as an irreprehensible and loyal public servant, one of those trustworthy figures that Nazarbayev would turn to when a government reshuffle was warranted.

In the meantime, however, Mynbayev was conducting business while holding public office, without declaring a potential conflict of interest. According to the leaked documents, Mynbayevs co-venturers would have behaved in violation of Kazakhstans law, in force between 2005 and 2011, banning bank shareholders from owning offshore assets. The legislation was put in place to counter potential capital flight, with banks lending out to offshore companies that would, in turn, not be accountable for non-payments. And this is precisely what happened.

The financialization of the oil sector, in particular, created a scheme all too familiar to observers of Kazakhstans trade flows.

Tax havens are one of the crucial nodes of the financialization of the oil trade. For instance, in 2015, roughly 15 percent of the crude oil exported from Mangystau, worth around $1 billion, was destined to Bermuda. It is quite unrealistic to assume that the crude was physically delivered to the Caribbean. The same can be said for Mangystaus largest importer, Switzerland (57 percent), where some of the largest companies trading oil futures are based, Totaro said.

Mynbayev, together with many others in the industry, could have benefited from the agile and obscure practice of selling oil through offshore entities. His position of privilege, within the highest echelons of the energy sector, however, could have given him and his associates an unfair advantage.

Under French law, an appeal suspends the judgment of the trial court and leads to a transfer of the case to the Court of Appeals which then retries the case in its entirety, the bank said in a statement.

618,"A man said to have run the UK arm of a ""truly massive"" international drug-smuggling operation has been jailed.

Cocaine and heroin worth £58m was shipped from Holland in 39 deliveries to a business unit on a Hertfordshire farm, St Albans Crown Court heard.

Robert Brooks, 50, from Hertford, had pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 21 years.

Police called it the East of England's biggest-ever drug operation, and three other men were jailed last week.

Brooks, of Elder Court, was described as the ""managing director"" of the English end of the enterprise that was connected to Europe and further afield, prosecutors said.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on the importation of a Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

The global operation, based in a rented unit at Little Samuels Farm, in Hunsdon, was the largest ever drugs conspiracy investigated by the Eastern Regions Special Operations Unit.

Last August, officers intercepted the final two deliveries out of 39 and seized 70kg (154lb) of cocaine and 45kg (99lb) of heroin.

The drugs were hidden at the bottom of a consignment of small-value goods such as spider catchers.

Judge Michael Kay QC described it as a ""truly massive operation"" and, passing sentence, said: ""Class A drugs destroy lives of those who are addicted to them, they destroy the lives of families of those who are addicted.

""Those who make money from such misery and degradation of fellow citizens will achieve substantial prison sentence. The business is not just illegal, it is immoral and despicable.""

619,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Two top executives at Westpac (WBK), one of Australia's biggest banks, are out after the company was hit with extensive claims that it had systematically allowed money laundering on its watch.

The company announced Tuesday that CEO Brian Hartzer will step down in the wake of allegations that the bank had violated money laundering and terrorism financing regulations tens of millions of times. Lindsay Maxsted, who serves as chairman of the board, will also move up his retirement to the first half of next year.

Hartzer, who has been on the job since 2015, will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Peter King while the bank looks for a permanent successor.

The company came under fire last week when AUSTRAC, an Australian regulator that fights financial crime, said that Westpac failed to report more than 19.5 million instructions for transfers in and out of Australia. The regulatory watchdog also said Westpac neglected to do its due diligence on transactions to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia ""that have known financial indicators relating to potential child exploitation.""

The agency alleges that Westpac broke the law more than 23 million times, each time in theory""attracting a civil penalty"" of between 17 million and 21 million Australian dollars. That could potentially saddle Westpac with a fine that far surpasses the 700 million Australian dollars ($474 million) levied last year on Commonwealth Bank of Australia after that bank admitted it failed to observe laws to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism.

In a statement Sunday, Maxsted said Westpac was working through its response to the allegations, and was determined to urgently fix the issues raised by the regulator. He added that the bank would commence an independent review.

Many of the allegations centered on how Westpac failed to detect money laundering or risky payments that AUSTRAC said were indicative of child exploitation. One of the alleged offenses listed in a court filing concerned LitePay, the bank's digital payments service that allows customers to make transfers of small amounts to users outside Australia.

Officials claim in the filing that Westpac has been aware of the connection between child exploitation and ""frequent low value payments"" sent to the Philippines and Southeast Asia ""since at least 2013."" And Westpac's senior management was ""specifically briefed"" on how Litepay could be at risk for such abuse in 2016, according to the filing.

The filing also claimed that Westpac failed to roll out a plan to detect some suspicious activity on LitePay until June 2018, and has yet to put in place such ""automated detection scenarios"" across other international payment systems.

Some of the undetected transactions involved payments to ""alleged or suspected child exploitation facilitators,"" according to the filing. In one case, a customer opened Westpac accounts after serving a sentence for ""child exploitation"" offenses, AUSTRAC added.

Westpac responded to AUSTRAC's filing with a proposed plan last week. The bank said it would undertake investments to reduce the risk of financial crime and roll out ""immediate fixes,"" such as shutting down LitePay.

""The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,"" the company said last week.

That did little to ease pressure on its executives. On Tuesday, Westpac said it would shake up its leadership ""in the wake of"" the allegations, and ""urgently fix"" the issues that were outlined by regulators. In addition to the two departures, a longtime board member announced he would not seek re-election.

""As CEO I accept that I am ultimately accountable for everything that happens at the bank,"" Hartzer said in a Westpac statement. ""And it is clear that we have fallen well short of what the community expects of us, and we expect of ourselves.""

Maxsted said in the statement that the board accepted ""the gravity of the issues raised by AUSTRAC.""

""It became clear that Board and management changes were in the best interest of the Bank,"" he said.

The bank is the latest to come under fire in Australia's financial sector, which has been rocked by scandals in recent months.

Last year, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBAUF) admitted that it had for years knowingly charged dead clients for advice. Two months later, the company was hit by the anti-money laundering fine.

Also in 2018, AMP  Australia's top wealth management firm  lost its chairwoman after claims surfaced that the firm had regularly overcharged its customers.

AMP said at the time that it took the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and was taking appropriate steps to address them. Its general counsel also left the firm, and the company said it would cut remuneration for its board directors by 25% for the rest of 2018.",am

Months of tortuous negotiation followed before Mr. Mugabe, as president, was able to swear in a reluctant Mr. Tsvangirai as his prime minister. It was the first time since the postelection government of 1980 that Mr. Mugabe had admitted an adversary into his cabinet. But the reality was that he was still very much in charge, retaining control of the military, the intelligence services and other tools of power.

Once again he had emasculated his opponents, and while he was partly restricted by international travel bans and sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States, he nonetheless maintained an international presence, attending the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly and the inauguration of Pope Francis at the Vatican.

Back home, his aides and generals were accused of profiting from diamond fields in the east, and outsiders feared that the proceeds would be used to finance more political malfeasance.

In the disputed 2013 elections, Mr. Mugabe was again declared the clear winner, ending the power-sharing arrangement with Mr. Tsvangirai. Many Zimbabweans seemed resigned to this display of Mr. Mugabes thirst for power.

Investigators in the cash-for-contracts scandal are expected to report their findings in mid-December, meaning a poll would be held in January.

But there are doubts Mr Martin will be able to hold on to power until then.

The three opposition parties are threatening to force a confidence motion in May.

Opposition anger

An inquiry into the affair has heard that Liberals in Quebec demanded kickbacks for rewarding advertising contracts.

Money earmarked for a programme to counter separatism in French-speaking Quebec was allegedly paid to Liberal-friendly advertising firms, who did little work in return.

On Thursday, Mr Martin apologised for his party's misdemeanours, calling the situation an ""unjustifiable mess"".

""Those who are in power are to be held responsible, and that includes me,"" he said on national television.

""I was the minister of finance and knowing what I have learned in the past year, I am sorry that I was not more vigilant.""

He said the poll would be called within 30 days of the judicial inquiry issuing its final report.

Mr Martin runs a minority government, having lost his majority in the Canadian House of Commons in last June's election because of public anger at the scandal.

623,"BOSTON  An Acton investment advisor and financial planner pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing more than $3.7 million from more than 20 clients over a 10-year period when authorities determined he filtered client funds into his own personal accounts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced.

Gerald Eaton, 51, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft on Wednesday and is scheduled to be sentenced in early 2021, according to a news release.

According to officials, Eaton worked as a certified financial planner and did business under the name of Heritage Financial Group. According to the complaint, Eaton invested client funds in securities and various insurance products, including life insurance policies and annuities. Authorities say between 1999 and 2019, Eaton stole nearly $4 million in client money from their accounts through selling securities, insurance policies and other accounts and had the proceeds moved to accounts that he either owned or personally controlled.

The U.S. Attorney's Office said that during this time, Eaton also forged clients' signatures on checks and other financial documents or convinced clients to sign documents that he said would lead to proceeds that would benefit his clients financially. Instead, authorities said he filtered funds to his credit card accounts to pay his personal and family expenses and also filtered money to a home equity line of credit. The complaint states that Eaton defrauded clients that he believed either would not notice money was gone from their accounts and also targeted clients who were elderly and were in poor physical or mental condition.

Eaton also lied to his firm and to various insurance companies that the transactions he was brokering were being carried out to benefit his clients, authorities said in the complaint against Eaton.

Eaton faces up to 20 years in prison for the mail and wire fraud charges along with three years of supervised probation and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain/loss, whichever is greater, the news release stated. The identity theft charge carries a two-year sentence, which would be served consecutive to any other prison sentence, one year of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 and restitution.

In addition to the prison sentence he faces, Eaton has been barred from working in the securities industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",am
624,"New York (CNN Business) Dan Kamensky, founder of hedge fund Marble Ridge Capital, was arrested and charged with fraud, extortion and obstruction of justice in connection to Neiman Marcus's bankruptcy bid, the US Department of Justice announced Thursday.

The charges are part of an alleged bid-rigging scheme tied to the retailer's bankruptcy.

According to the Justice Department, Kamensky sought to suppress a rival bid for Neiman's MyTheresa assets so that Marble Ridge could secure the shares for a lower price. Then he attempted to coerce the rival bidder to cover up the alleged scheme, the DOJ said.

Kamensky has been charged with one count of fraud in the offer or sale of securities, one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion and bribery in connection with a bankruptcy and one count of obstruction of justice. Each count carries a maximum sentence ranging from 5 to 20 years in prison.

A spokesperson for Marble Ridge declined to comment on the charges.

The alleged scheme was revealed last month in a Justice Department watchdog report, which prompted Marble Ridge to shut down. The hedge fund, which had more than $1 billion in assets, sent a letter to investors on August 20 saying it would be winding down its funds, according to a Reuters report.

""After much consideration, and in light of the operating environment, we have made the difficult decision to commence an orderly wind-down of the Marble Ridge funds,"" Marble Ridge told its clients in the letter.

Authorities said Laksha Bohra had taken advantage of her job as a senior manager in Amazon's tax department to provide the tips, despite repeated warnings against leaking confidential information.

Viky Bohra then used the tips to make successful trades ahead of Amazon earnings announcements, through accounts tied to him and his father Gotham Bohra, authorities said.

A lawyer for Viky Bohra had no immediate comment.

Under a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that Viky Bohra serve no more than 33 months in prison, and agreed that Laksha Bohra will not face criminal charges.

Viky Bohra faces a Feb. 8, 2021 sentencing before U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, where Amazon is based.

The Bohras settled related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges in September by agreeing to forfeit trading profits and pay a combined US$1.11 million in fines.

626,"The City regulator has fined Bank of Scotland £45.5m for failing to disclose information about a £245m fraud scandal at the banks Reading branch which resulted in six people going to jail.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the bank had risked substantial prejudice to the interests of justice by withholding information. At the time of the fraud, Bank of Scotland was part of the HBOS group, which was acquired by Lloyds in 2009.

The fine is in relation to a scam involving rogue employees at HBOSs Reading branch and a group of consultants that ran between 2003 and 2007. It drained the bank and small businesses of about £245m and left hundreds of people in severe financial difficulty. The fine was reduced by almost £20m because the bank agreed to settle.

HBOS first identified suspicious behaviour in its impaired assets team  which handled struggling business  in early 2007, but failed to notify regulators fully until July 2009.

Under the fraudulent scheme, small firms were pushed under or damaged by being referred to a turnaround consultancy and loaded with unmanageable debts and fees. The fraudsters spent the proceeds on sex workers, superyachts and luxury holidays.

The FCA said there had been insufficient challenge, scrutiny or inquiry across the organisation and from top to bottom, but said it had found no evidence that anyone had considered the consequences of not telling authorities about the suspicions.

Lloyds took over HBOS in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. While the acquisition made the newly formed Lloyds Banking Group the dominant player on the British high street, it also proved deeply problematic and the government was forced to bail out the bank.

The fallout from the Reading fraud has lasted for more than a decade, with victims highly critical of the banks handling of the scandal and derisory settlements. Those affected have been offered packages ranging from less than £100,000 to more than £5m.

On Friday, the FCA also banned four individuals from working in financial services, two years after they were convicted of fraud and sent to prison. They are Lynden Scourfield, Mark Dobson, Alison Mills and David Mills. Scourfield and Dobson were both former HBOS employees.

Nikki Turner, one of the fraud victims and a member of the SME Alliance business group, called for the FCA to investigate a cover-up by senior executives at HBOS.

Action coming over a decade after the event is the ultimate insult. The only bankers banned are those whod never work in the industry again, while their bosses get off scot-free and the bank is fined what is little more than small change, she said. It is also insulting that Lloyds receives a discount for being a good boy.

Lloyds also held out for years against the publication of a highly critical whistleblower report, which was eventually leaked. The FCA has been criticised for its handling of the report.

Mark Steward, the director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: Bank of Scotland failed to alert the regulator and the police about suspicions of fraud at its Reading branch when those suspicions first became apparent.????? BOSs failures caused delays to the investigations by both the FCA and Thames Valley police.

There is no evidence anyone properly addressed their mind to this matter or its consequences. The result risked substantial prejudice to the interests of justice, delaying scrutiny of the fraud by regulators, the start of criminal proceedings as well as the payment of compensation to customers.

António Horta-Osório, Lloyds Banking Groups chief executive, apologised for the dark period in HBOSs history.

He added: I want to apologise once again for the very deep distress caused to the customers affected by the HBOS Reading fraud. The perpetrators of the fraud rightly went to jail for the crimes they committed. The groups management team has been committed to putting things right.

Horta-Osório said Lloyds has offered compensation to the victims of the fraud, with 98% of the offers accepted so far. Lloyds has appointed a former high court judge, Sir Ross Cranston, to run an independent review of the compensation scheme.",am
627,"PORTLAND, Ore.Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, announced today the indictment of three people for their roles in a complex scheme to launder proceeds from the sale of illegal narcotics by facilitating the transfer of bulk cash from Mexican drug trafficking organizations to Chinese nationals residing in the U.S.

Shefeng Su, 39, Xinhua Li Yan, 39, and Xiancong Su, 46, are each charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Shefeng Su and Li Yan were residents of Portland during the timeframe alleged in the indictment.

According to the indictment, the defendants money laundering scheme was designed to remedy two separate problems: drug trafficking organizations inability to repatriate drug proceeds into the Mexican banking system and wealthy Chinese nationals restricted by Chinas capital flight laws from transferring large sums of money held in Chinese bank accounts for use abroad.

The first group, drug traffickers, are challenged by their inability to transport U.S. currency acquired from the sale of illegal narcotics in the U.S. to Mexico while avoiding detection by law enforcement and Mexican banking regulators. Mexicos anti-money laundering regulations limit the amount of cash deposits of U.S. dollars that Mexican financial institutions can receive. As a result, drug trafficking organizations work with professional money launderers to bundle and sell bulk U.S. dollars in order to convert them to pesos, a more readily depositable currency in Mexico.

The second group, Chinese nationals living outside China, are challenged by Chinas limit on the amount of personal funds that can be transferred out of Chinese bank accounts for use in a foreign country. Currently, China limits these transfers to $50,000 per year. As a result, some Chinese nationals have a need to acquire large quantities of U.S. dollars via other means.

The defendants scheme facilitated the transfer of cash between these two groups. Their money laundering organization would facilitate the transfer of funds from the buyers Chinese bank account to another Chinese bank account held by the money laundering organization. Once the Chinese renminbi (RMB) were transferred between these bank accounts, the funds were repatriated back to Mexico and converted to pesos to complete the money laundering cycle. This scheme has been described by some as the Chinese Underground Banking System.

All three defendants are at-large and believed to be outside the U.S.This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Oregon.

Portnov versus Poroshenko

The investigation was initiated by Andriy Portnov, a former deputy head in the administration of ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia following his ouster in 2014. Portnov himself fled to Russia that year, then moved to the West but returned to Ukraine before Zelenskiy's swearing-in. He is on a kind of political crusade against Poroshenko and has submitted a range of charges against the former president, including treason.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a Poroshenko ally, was also summoned the State Bureau of Investigation in late July. He is accused of involvement in the sale of city land plots. Klitschko, however, failed to show up, calling the accusations a petty affair. At the same time, it was revealed that Zelenskiy had requested Klitschko be removed from Kyiv's city council  an office he holds in addition to serving as mayor. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, meanwhile, is reportedly investigating Poroshenko and Klitschko on a range of issues.

Officially, Zelenskiy has no role in any of this. He has avoiding directly threatening Poroshenko and his allies. But there is speculation that all this may be connected to Portnov. In an interview, Andriy Bohdan, who heads Zelenskiy's presidential administration, said Portnov ""has long been a friend."" Asked whether Portnov's actions had been coordinated with Zelenskiy, Bohdan replied that Portnov was acting independently. ""I do not know these charges, but I think there is truth in them,"" he said.

High-ranking politicians on trial

Zelenskiy is not the first Ukrainian president to campaign on prosecuting corrupt elites. In 2004, Viktor Yushchenko threatened to throw corrupt ""bandits"" in jail  though he did not deliver on his promise after winning the presidency. His successor, Yanukovych, did not issue any such threats. However, leading opposition figures Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko were jailed under his reign. Their incarceration was criticized in the West as politically motivated.

During Poroshenko's presidency, the former parliamentary faction leader of Yanukovych's party, Oleksandr Yefremov, was jailed for three years for allegedly assisting separatists in eastern Ukraine. He was released in July but remains under house arrest. Poroshenko's announcement to weed out corruption in the army and ""sever their arms"" remained an empty promise, meanwhile.

Ukrainians want corrupt figures prosecuted

Zelenskiy's absolute majority in parliament gives him more power than his predecessor. He wants to do away with lawmakers' immunity, which would allow people such as Poroshenko to be prosecuted. Many Ukrainians, it seems, want to see lawmakers on trial.

""This urge has always existed in Ukrainian society,"" said Olexiy Haran, a professor of politics at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, noting it is in part due to the passive role the judiciary played under Poroshenko. ""I think Zelenskiy will be very tempted to organize something like show trials.""

Haran noted the importance of whether these trials ""are conducted in accordance with the rule of law, or if this will be a case of selective justice."" After all, he said, Zelenskiy announced Poroshenko and Klitschko would be tried and the fact that they have now been summoned to give testimony ""is a deeply worrying sign.""

A politicized judiciary?

Poroshenko, meanwhile, has denied all the accusations against him but has also conspicuously refrained from criticizing Zelensiky. His European Solidarity party, however, has expressed fear that the former president could become the victim of ""politically motivated"" trials.

Wilfried Jilge of the German Council on Foreign Relations warned that while it is good that Zelenskiy is dedicated to fighting corruption, the current developments show a ""dangerous trend."" It is ""conspicuous that Zelenskiy permanently criticizes the misdeeds of Poroshenko and other decision-makers, as well as those officeholders named Poroshenko, but ignores everyone else,"" he said. What's more, Jilge added, Zelenskiy is turning his anti-corruption drive into something akin to a ""public drama."" He noted one instance where Zelenskiy and Bohdan visited a tram manufacturer in Dnipro and called Klitschko to ask him why the city had not paid for the vehicles it had bought.

This kind of public anti-corruption campaign runs the risk of ""courts ruling in accordance with the political powers that be,"" said Jilge.",am
630,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's financial crime agency began investigating casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd CWN.AX on suspicion of failure to comply with anti money-laundering protocols, putting a planned resort opening under pressure and sending its shares tumbling.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said it began an enforcement investigation into Crowns main casino in Melbourne following a compliance assessment started a year earlier, without commenting further.

AUSTRACs concerns were focused on Crown Melbournes management of customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons, Crown said in a separate statement.

The investigation adds to an already sizable headache for the company 37% owned by billionaire James Packer as it pushes ahead with a plan to open a new casino in Sydney in December.

Another inquiry by a state regulator has been airing allegations of dysfunctional senior management, poor risk control and issuing false public statements.

The inquiry has already asked Crowns directors why the company is opening a casino during a review which will decide if it can keep its licence.

It was triggered by media reports in mid-2019 which accused Crown of doing business with casino tour, or junket, operators who had not been vetted for organised crime links. Crown initially denied the allegations in full-page newspaper advertisements but has acknowledged at the inquiry parts of the denial were misleading.

Shares of Crown fell 10% by late morning, compared to a higher overall market .AXJO, as investors weighed the impact of another challenge for a company already facing a showdown at its annual general meeting on Thursday.

It will be volatile for a time. This has got uncertainty written all over it, said Mathan Somasundaram, CEO of investment researcher Deep Data Analytics.

The last high profile company pursued by AUSTRAC, No. 2 lender Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX, agreed to a A$1.3 billion fine last month over unrelated compliance failures.

Crown was plunged into crisis in 2016 when 16 of its staff were jailed in China for selling casino holidays, violating that countrys gambling ban. Crown quit its overseas interests to focus on the Sydney resort to grow profit.

In the years since, Packer has quit the board of the company he started.

Hollander, who was found dead on Monday in an apparent suicide, was the sole suspect in the Sunday attack at Salas home. The attack killed the 20-year-old son of Salas, a judge on the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, and wounded her husband.

The FBI says it now believes Hollander was involved in the death of Angelucci, who was vice president of the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). Angelucci was found July 11 with apparent gunshot wounds in Cedarpines Park, California, which is about 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

NCFM President Harry Crouch told Reuters that Hollander and Angelucci had had a falling out several years ago around the time Hollander was dismissed from the organization.",nam
633,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is paying nearly $283 million to settle a seven-year federal bribery investigation involving its business in Brazil, China, India and Mexico.

From 2000 to 2011, Walmart subsidiaries in those countries operated without ""sufficient anti-corruption"" oversight at the company, according to an order filed Thursday from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The world's largest retailer allowed its subsidiaries to employ third-party intermediaries who made payments to foreign government officials without making sure those payments were not used as bribes, the SEC said.

When Walmart learned of corruption risks, the company did not ""sufficiently investigate the allegations"" or mitigate them, the SEC said. The SEC charged Walmart under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies from paying bribes to foreign officials.

""Walmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance,"" said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit. ""The company could have avoided many of these problems, but instead Walmart repeatedly failed to take red flags seriously and delayed the implementation of appropriate internal accounting controls.""

Walmart (WMT) agreed to pay more than $144 million to settle the SEC's charges and an additional $138 million to resolve criminal charges brought by the Department of Justice. Walmart's Brazilian subsidiary also pleaded guilty in connection with the resolution.

As part of the settlement, the Department of Justice won't prosecute Walmart if it follows its agreement for three years. The company has also agreed to independent oversight for two years, and it will report to the SEC on its Anti-Corruption Compliance Program for two years.

In 2017, Walmart said it set aside $283 million for a possible resolution of the investigation with US government agencies.

""We're pleased to resolve this matter,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement Thursday. ""Walmart is committed to doing business the right way, and that means acting ethically everywhere we operate.""

Last year, Walmart sold 80% of its stake in its Brazil operations to private equity firm Advent International. It recorded a $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale.

At the end of January, Walmart had 2,442 stores in Mexico, 443 in China and 22 in India, according to its latest annual filing.",am
634,"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday (18 September) filed a supplementary chargesheet in the infamous AgustaWestland chopper scam case naming alleged key middleman Christian Michel James, accused-turned-approver Rajeev Saxena and 13 others.

The charge sheet in the VVIP chopper scam case has been filed before Special Judge Arvind Kumar in Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court.

The other 13 accused also include some top government officials who were part of the deal worth Rs 3,600 crore with the the British-Italian manufacturer AgustaWestland. It is significant to note here that no politician has been named in the chargesheet.

The investigation agency has not yet named former defence secretary and comptroller and auditor general Shashi Kant Sharma and former air vice-marshal Jasbir Singh Panesa due to delay in persecution sanctions against them from the government.

Earlier in March, the CBI had asked the central government to sanction persecution against Sharma, Panesar and three other Indian Air Force (IAF) officers in the case.

The Special Judge has now listed the matter for September 21 for consideration of the supplementary charge sheet. The first charge sheet in the case was filed in September 2017.

The case pertains to buying of 12 AgustaWestland helicopters built by Italian defence manufacturing giant Finmeccanica (now known as the group) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,600 crore for ferrying VVIPs. In the deal, bribes were allegedly paid to middlemen and others. The purchase was cleared in 2010 by the then UPA government.

On 1 January, 2014, India cancelled the contract with Finmeccanica's British subsidiary AgustaWestland for supplying 12 AW-101 VVIP choppers to the IAF, over alleged breach of contractual obligations and on charges of paying kickbacks amounting to Rs 423 crore.

The CBI, which registered an FIR in the case on 12 March, 2013, had alleged that former IAF chief S P Tyagi, some of his relatives and the other accused received kickbacks from AgustaWestland to help it win the contract.

The CBI probe revealed that several payments were made to the Tyagis by alleged middlemen Guido Haschke, Carlo Gerosa and Christian Michel.

Indian investigative agencies in December 2018 arrested British national Michel after he was handed over by the UAE and he has been in judicial custody ever since. Dubai-based businessman Saxena was extradited to India on 31 January, 2019 in connection with the case.",am
635,"The Coal Scam. CoalGate

The coal allocation scam is also referred to as the CoalGate scam. This was a scam in India that shook the nation when it came to light. It was one of the most important and highlighted political scandals which was concerned with the allocation of the Indian subcontinents coal deposits to private as well as public sector companies.

Coal Scam

This is the responsibility of the Indian government and that is why all the burden was on their shoulders. In March 2014, a draft had been issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. This is the CAG. This reports accuses the Indian Government of not being able to allocate coal blocks efficiently between the two previously mentioned sectors. The period was this low efficiency is 2004-2009. This was a time when the Congress Party was in power in the nation. Unlike the present times when BJP has been performing way better, that was an age full or scams. In 2012, the reigns for investigations were handed over to the CBI (central Bureau of Investigation) to look into the matter and determine whether the allocation was indeed unduly influenced by corruption.

The argument that has been put forward by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is that even though the Government of India had the power and status to allocate the coal blocks between the two sectors using competitive bidding, it chose to go other way and not abide by this. This is what in turn led to the development of less payment by both the public and private sectors. If they had followed competitive bidding, then the funds raised would have been higher. In its draft that had been submitted, the CAG estimated the ""windfall gain"" to the allocates to be ?10,673 billion. However, the final report sealed the deal at ?1,856 billion. This definitely did not go down too well with the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh and he rebuked the entire submission.

A very important fact you must note here is that initially, the CAG report was merely focusing on the fact that coal blocks had not been allocated on fair terms. There was no question of corruption anywhere. However, it was over the course of 2012 that the topic entirely switched over and the corruption of the Congress party came to become the centre of attention. When the BJP filed a complaint, the CVC or the Central Vigilance Commission initiated the CBI to look into the case. In the first move towards getting into the depth of the matter, the CBI named a number of top Indian enterprises in its FIRs. According to these FIRs, these companies have been charged with the crime of purposely overstating their total value, inability to state the previous coal allocations and hoarding of the coal allocations instead of playing a part in developing it. There has also been speculation that bribery may be involved.

CBI India

The matter became a huge issue. The masses were outraged and the media kept talking about various aspects of the case. In fact, there had also come a time when the BJP had demanded that the Congress Prime Minister should resign, or else they would not be a part of the Parliaments debate. It was then stated that all the distribution from 1993 to 2008 had been done in an unauthorized way.

Names of top ministers active and involved at that time:

· Sriprakash Jaiswal

· Manmohan Singh

· Sibu Soren

· Mamata Banerjee

· Ram Vilas Paswan

· Syed Shanawaz Hussain

· Sunder Lal Patwa

· BJP Naveen Patnaik

India is a country that is one of the largest coal producers on this globe. It has a number of regions within the boundary of the nation that are highly rich in coal. Some of these regions are Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh in the east. There are several areas in the central and the southern part as well. This implies that there is no dearth of areas which have coal. These are then divided into blocks and then leased to mining companies so that make the most of the region under their kitty as well as develop surplus. You would be taken aback to know that more than fifty percent of the commercial energy needs of the Indian subcontinent are met by the use of coal. It is thus, the most important fuel for steel and cement plants. Coal India Limited, owned by the state, is the sole agency that sells coal in India.

2. How are the coal blocks allocated?

It was in 1973 that the Indian government took over coal mining in the country. In 1976, private producers were allowed to own mines and in 1993 power companies too joined the league. Till 2005, rapid licences were issued. However, in 20014, the Congress realised that CIL would be unable to produce enough for the new thermal plants. Thus, companies from both the sector were granted ownership to produce and develop more.

3. Is auction a fairer way?

Previously, auction was chosen. But, it was later realised that it was not possible because they felt that the price of the coal would increase a lot and the chief ministers felt that their grip over the role was diminishing. However, the auction bill was passed in 2008 and in 2010, it became a low. The delay was explained as time taken to make policies. Now, coming to the opposition, it was felt that the higher prices may be undue for a major chunk of the population. Thus, the government may actually be making profits at the cost of the consumers.

Justice for Taxpayers Needed

The answer was competitive bidding where the bid would be sealed and submitted before everyone. The need of the hour was a transparent process where the public knows everything and there are no secrets.

636,"Zhang Zhinan, former vice-governor of East China's Fujian province, has been punished for breaking Party disciplines and failing to implement the Party's policies in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic, according to top anti-corruption watchdogs.

The Communist Party of China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission said in a statement on Wednesday that investigators found Zhang, 59, had ""seriously violated the Party's political, organizational, clean-governance and personal conduct disciplines"". They also said he was involved in crimes, such as bribery and abuse of power.

Zhang was placed under internal investigation in April, becoming the first provincial-level official to be nailed by anti-graft authorities in 2020.

Investigators found that Zhang was not serious in implementing the Party's policies on combating COVID-19 when the epidemic was at its most crucial time in China. He took advantage of his power to seek profits for family members and relatives, and offered favor to those who gave him money or sexual bribes, causing huge losses to public assets, according to probe findings.

Zhang has been deprived of his Party membership and jobs with irregular and illegal income being confiscated. He also has been transferred to prosecutors for further criminal investigation, the statement said.

Born in October 1960 in Fujian, Zhang joined the Party in 1979 and landed a job on the Party committee in Fujian's Longyan county in 1981.

After moving up through the ranks of local governments for more than 20 years, he was appointed deputy secretary-general of the provincial government in 2002 and then head of the provincial development and reform commission in 2005. In 2008, he was named vice-governor of Fujian.",am
637,"Joe Ashton, a former vice president of the United Automobile Workers Union, has been charged with bribery and money laundering, according to court documents filed Wednesday. The now-retired Ashton is the 13th person charged in connection with the corruption scandal, and also the highest ranking.

The move by federal authorities comes just days after UAW President Gary Jones stepped aside temporarily as he also comes under scrutiny.

The scandal has tainted a union long seen as one of the cleanest in the American labor movement. And recent events have cast a cloud over ongoing contract negotiations between the UAW and Detroits Big Three since some officials reportedly took bribes to back off on demands during prior contract talks.

Over the last two years, an array of union officials, as well as some executives from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors, have been charged with a variety of crimes involving kickbacks, fraud and money laundering.

Ashton was reportedly under the federal microscope for some time. His top aide, Jeff Pietrzyk, already pleaded guilty to his role in the case. The case laid out by federal prosecutors involves a variety of shady deals, including the production of $4 million worth of commemorative UAW watches. All told, he reportedly helped direct $15.8 million worth of union contracts for his personal benefit.

Ashton, who stepped down from his union post in 2014, was closely associated with other top UAW officials, including former president Dennis Williams and his successor. Those two were among a number of current and former union officials who were targeted in an FBI raid of their homes searching for additional evidence of corruption.

While neither Williams nor Jones have been charged, local news reports have speculated as to if and when they also could face indictments.

For his part, the current UAW chief announced over the weekend that he would take a paid leave of absence while the corruption probe continues. That move came as union members at Ford were set to begin voting on a new, four-year tentative contract with the automaker. Once that settlement is wrapped up, UAW bargainers will move over to Fiat Chrysler to push for an agreement there.

""The UAW is fighting tooth and nail to ensure our members have a brighter future,"" Jones said in a statement. ""I do not want anything to distract from the mission. I want to do what's best for the members of this great union.""

Concerns about the scandal have weighed heavily on both sides during the ongoing round of contract talks, according to Arthur Schwartz, a former GM negotiator and now head of Labor and Economic Associates. Union bargainers, in particular, he said, were concerned that workers might not think they were getting enough in the light of evidence that surfaced through the corruption probe. That may have contributed to the 40-day strike at General Motors, he told NBC News.

There were significant challenges facing both sides, notably including the handling of thousands of contract workers, many of whom will be able to get full time status, under the agreement finally reached with GM.

That issue is expected to also be at the forefront when talks resume at FCA, having been put on hold in September so senior union negotiators could focus on GM. But the Fiat Chrysler talks also are expected to be complicated by the automakers announcement last week that it plans to merge with Frances PSA Peugeot, said Schwartz, adding that the union will want to make moves now to prevent eventual job losses.",am
638,"The former leader of Mexicos largest trade union confederation operated a trust and hid millions of dollars in offshore tax havens, according to documents contained in a massive leak of secret files released yesterday called the Paradise Papers.

Joaquín Gamboa Pascoe, who headed the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) from 2005 until his death at age 93 in February 2016, left an inheritance to his wife and children of at least US $15.5 million.

During the two years preceding his death, millions of dollars were transferred to bank accounts he held in Germany, the United States, Canada and England.

Information in the Paradise Papers  13.4 million documents obtained by German newspaper Südeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)  calls into question the legitimacy of that wealth. The files were mainly sourced from offshore law firm Appleby.

Gamboa, who also served as both a senator and deputy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), set up a trust in the Cayman Islands in 1982 called Burma 2000, according to documents included in the huge data dump.

The trust allegedly acted as a front company to hide cash transactions made by an offshore Panamanian company called Karin Corporation. The newspaper Reforma said the operations of both were like layers of an onion, each one hiding the other.

The same year that Gamboa Pascoe set up the trust, he concluded his first term as a senator during the administration of president José López Portillo, one of Mexicos most questionable governments in terms of corruption.

In November 2007, Appleby received a letter from the union leaders son, Alejandro Gamboa, asking it to close the Cayman Islands trust. The Panamanian company remains open.

During his life, Gamboa had no qualms about showing off his wealth.

A year before his death, he organized an event to pay homage to his own lifetime achievements at which he unveiled a statue in his honor. When questioned about his ostentatious lifestyle, which included driving luxury cars, his usual response was:

What? If the workers are screwed, I have to be as well?

Gamboa Pascoe is not the only Mexican to make an appearance in the Paradise Papers.

Javier Miguel Afif, a businessman with links to the PRI, and Pedro Aspe, a former finance secretary who served during the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-94), also appear.

However, not all of those named have connections to the PRI, the political party most often cited in relation to corruption and which ruled Mexico uninterrupted for more than seven decades until the year 2000.

Former secretary of public security Alejandro Gertz, who served during the administration of National Action Party (PAN) President Vicente Fox (2000-2006), and Marcial Maciel, founder of the Catholic religious institute the Legion of Christ are also named.

All had money invested in noted tax havens including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Barbados and Malta, according to the leaked documents.

Money recovered by the federal tax agency (SAT) related to questionable  or illegal  offshore investments is minimal in comparison to the amounts that have flowed out of the country, accounting for just under 7.5 billion pesos (about US $393 million) over the past 15 years, an amount similar to the economic spillover from tourists during this years Easter vacation period.

The poor tax recovery record can be at least partially attributed to the difficulty in some cases of accessing fiscal data from authorities in tax havens.

At least 100 Mexican companies, including four established by two prominent football players, are registered in Malta but Mexico doesnt have any agreement with that country to share financial information.

The Paradise Papers come a year and a half after a similar raft of leaked documents called the Panama Papers was made public, triggering a tax probe of at least 33 Mexicans.",am
639,"Prosecutors believe Muñoz accepted cash bribes on behalf of the Kirchners to buy the luxury condos in Miami and Manhattan

Following the arrests of four people, authorities in Argentina have uncovered how a former president may have used bribe money to buy U.S. properties, including luxury condos in New York City and South Florida.

The arrests were ordered by an Argentine judge overseeing a corruption case against the former president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. She is accused of accepting bribe money from construction companies in exchange for contracts from the Argentine government. Critina Fernández de Kirchner has denied the accusations.

Prosecutors accuse the four arrested individuals of using bribe money to buy real estate on behalf of Hector Daniel Muñoz, a longtime personal secretary of Nestor Kirchner, the late husband of Fernández de Kirchner who also served as president of Argentina. Muñoz died in 2016.

Prosecutors believe Muñoz accepted cash bribes on behalf of the Kirchners to buy luxury condos in Miami and Manhattan and such South Florida commercial properties as bank offices and pharmacies.

All of the U.S. properties have been sold for nearly US$ 73 million, so prosecutors must locate the proceeds of the sales in order to seize any assets.

The property purchases were made by Florida companies registered to Elizabeth Ortiz Municoy and her ex-husband, Sergio Todisco, who both were arrested last month by federal police in Argentina. Municoy is an Argentine national who runs a real estate business that operated and eventually vacated a branch office in Surfside, Miami.

In late October, Municoy and Todisco were arrested in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where they reside.

The involvement of Muñoz in the real estate purchases was revealed in a leak of secret corporate documents known as the Panama Papers, which showed that he and his wife owned a British Virgin Islands company registered to Todisco.

Municoy apparently has been eliminating her ties to the United States as the investigation of Fernández de Kirchner advances. The Surfside branch office of her business, Municoy Intenational Properties, has been vacant for more than a year, and she sold her US$ 800,000 condo in Hollywood in 2017.

Ortiz Municoy, who has been released from jail, reportedly began cooperating with prosecutors in the Fernández de Kirchner case and explaining the involvement of Muñoz in the U.S. real estate purchases.

Todisco remains in custody, as do two other arrested individuals: Carolina Pochetti, the widow of Muñoz, and businessman Carlos Cortez, who paid US$ 2.9 million for condos in Sunrise and Miami through companies registered to him.

One of the companies registered to Cortez, New Dreams LLC, was created under the guidance of Olga Santini, a Miami representative of the now-closed Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, whose files were leaked in the Panama Papers. (Miami Herald).",am
640,"A Miami, Florida, certified public accountant (CPA) was sentenced today to 39 months in prison for tax evasion, announced U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division, and Chief Don Fort, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).

U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan stated, Rather than uphold the ethical obligations and professional code of conduct of a dutiful tax professional, Darryl Sharpton defrauded the federal government to avoid paying his own taxes, as well as taxes withheld from his employees pay. As millions of hard-working taxpayers prepare and file their tax returns this season, todays prison sentence should serve as a reminder of the stiff penalties that will be imposed on those who undermine the integrity of the U.S. tax system.

Tax professionals, such as Darryl Sharpton, who use their expertise to commit tax fraud and enrich themselves rather than to assist honest taxpayers will be fully prosecuted by the Department of Justice and held accountable for their criminal conduct, stated Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman. Employment tax fraud is a violation of the trust of employees and all honest taxpayers.

For years, Darryl Sharpton, a CPA with three decades of public accounting and consulting experience, cheated the government and egregiously evaded the payment of substantial amounts of income taxes, stated Chief Don Fort, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). Todays sentencing is an important victory for American taxpayers who play by the rules and have no tolerance for those who fail to pay their fair share. IRS-CI will continue to investigate and recommend prosecution for individuals such as Mr. Sharpton who ignore the law and shun their tax responsibilities.

In December 2018, Darryl Sharpton, a CPA living in Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty to willfully evading the payment of federal income taxes for tax years 2004 through 2008, and 2010. Sharpton was an owner of The Sharpton Group, formerly known as Sharpton, Brunson and Company. The Sharpton Group specialized in financial and management consulting, audit and attestation, and tax and wealth planning. Sharpton filed personal income tax returns for years 2004 through 2008 and 2010, but willfully evaded payment of the taxes he owed for those years. To facilitate his fraud, Sharpton caused The Sharpton Group to pay his personal expenses through its corporate bank accounts, and then falsely stated to an IRS Revenue Officer that he did not pay his personal expenses from the corporate bank accounts.

The indictment also alleged that, after the IRS issued levies and liens against Sharpton to collect his unpaid tax liabilities, Sharpton took affirmative steps to evade the IRSs collection efforts, including removing himself from The Sharpton Groups payroll after the IRS issued a levy against his wages in 2007. Sharpton also admitted to not filing personal income tax returns for the years 2009 and 2011 through 2016.

Sharpton also failed to pay over to the IRS payroll taxes for The Sharpton Group for the quarters ending Dec. 31, 2012 through Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2014 through Dec 31, 2017.

In addition to the term of imprisonment imposed, U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga ordered Sharpton to serve three years of supervised release and to pay $1,380,602 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.

U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman commended special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Christopher J. Clark and Trial Attorneys Mara Strier and Sean Beaty of the Tax Division, who prosecuted the case.

641,"LONDON: Britain's accounting regulator said on Thursday it has fined Deloitte a record 15 million pounds (US$19.4 million) for its audit of software firm Autonomy that contained ""serious and serial failures"".

Deloitte, one of the worlds Big Four auditors, and two of its now former partners, Richard Knights and Nigel Mercer, were investigated in relation to their audit of Autonomys financial statements for 2009 and 2010.

Autonomy, founded by Mike Lynch, was bought for US$11 billion by Hewlett Packard (HP) in 2011, but the deal turned sour a year later when HP wrote off three-quarters of the former FTSE 100 companys value, alleging it had been deceived by its finances.

The Financial Reporting Council said Deloitte has also been severely reprimanded, and has agreed to provide a ""root cause"" analysis of the reasons for the misconduct.

Deloitte said it regretted that the FRC tribunal had ruled that aspects of its audit work on Autonomy between 2009 and 2011 fell below the professional standards required.

""Our audit practices and processes have evolved significantly since this work was performed over a decade ago, and we continue to transform our audit by investing in firm-wide controls, technology and processes,"" Deloitte said.

Knights has been excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales for five years and fined 500,000 pounds, the FRC said. Mercer has been fined 250,000 pounds and received a severe reprimand.

The FRC's previous record fine, of 10 million pounds in 2018, was for Big Four rival PwC's audit of retailer BHS, which later collapsed.

Deloitte had challenged the FRC at a Tribunal hearing in July.

""After lengthy, fully contested proceedings, the Tribunal concluded that the audit work fell significantly short of the standards expected of an audit firm and its partners,"" said Elizabeth Barrett, the FRC's executive counsel, in a statement.

Morais was named as one of the two recipients of the International Anti-Corruption Award 2020 at the Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion Fund (PIACCF) launch, here tonight.
Morais was abducted and murdered while on his way to work in September 2015, while investigating a corruption scandal.

His body was chopped up and put into a cement drum before it was discovered and confirmed through a DNA test.

The other award recipient was Novel Baswedan, the Head of Investigator for Indonesianâs Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK).

Novel, from Jakarta, Indonesia, was attacked on April 11, 2017. He was returning from dawn prayers near his house in Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta when he was sprayed with chemical-laced water by his attackers.

He survived the attack but lost sight in one eye as a result.

Both men were honoured for their bravery in fighting and exposing corruption activities in their respective countries.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad presented the awards to Novel and Morais' brother Datuk Richard Morais, who accepted the posthumous award on his late brother's behalf.

Dr Mahathir paid tribute to the men's courage and determination to eradicate corruption.

""These are among the men who deserve to be hailed as heroes for going all out in the fight against corruption and the danger and threats that come with the job. These two men are some of the most dedicated men who paid a very heavy price for their battle against corruption,"" said the prime minister in his keynote speech.

Dr Mahathir said the fund is not only special but also important because it acts as a support system for anti-corruption officers who had been victimised and subjected to persecution in the line of duty.

""We know that combatting and exposing corruption are very dangerous and the world has witnessed many of those who attempted to do so pay dearly, even with their lives.

""Obviously, those who involve themselves in corruption are powerful and rich. Their objective is normally to gain more power and wealth and these people are powerful enough to punish and stop anyone who tries to end their shenanigans.

""We are here to tell the world that all the anti-corruption officers who had paid heavy prices in the course of their duty are our champions and our heroes,"" he said.

Dr Mahathir also added a special mention for former Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, former Bank Negara Governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Chief Commissioner

Datuk Seri Mohd Shukri Abdull for their role in exposing the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal.

Dr Mahathir said 1MDB is a significant case which became the turning point of Malaysiaâs political direction and sparked an awakening among Malaysians.

""Their collective courage and determination brought a kleptocratic regime to its feet, in an unprecedented show of peopleâs power. I would also like to express my utmost regards for all the men and women across the globe who had given their time, lives and commitment in putting an end to the corruption scourge.â

Among those present at the PIACCF launch were United Nationâs Resident Coordinator Stefan Priesner; National Centre for Governance, Integrity and Anti-Corruption (GIACC) director-general Tan Sri Abu Kassim Mohamed: International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA) representative Martin Kreutner; the prime minister's wife Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali as well as cabinet ministers.

Kreutner, meanwhile, said the fund was created to help anti-corruption agents, with the larger aim of enabling anti-corruption agencies to be independent and fight for the truth without fear.

The establishment was set up in line with the United Nation Conventions Against Corruption's (UNCAC) code which makes protection compulsory for graft busters, who are state members of IAACA.

Kreutner added that the setting up of the fund followed the adoption to establish the fund at IAACA General Conference in Vienna, in Jan last year.

Malaysia started the fund with a RM500,000 contribution, followed by Yayasan Bukhari which donated RM2.5 million.

The Bribery Act 2010 creates a new offence under section 7 which can be committed by commercial organisations which fail to prevent persons associated with them from bribing another person on their behalf.

An organisation that can prove it has adequate procedures in place to prevent persons associated with it from bribing will have a defence to the section 7 offence.

The guidance, published here under section 9 of the Act, will help commercial organisations of all sizes and sectors understand what sorts of procedures they can put in place to prevent bribery, as mentioned in section 7.

A quick start guide has also been published which sets out the key points.

A report assessing the impact and awareness of the Bribery Act 2010 among small and medium sized enterprises exporting goods overseas is also available.

2,"Abstract

Trading by corporate insiders has been a significant public policy issue in the United States for the past several decades. Despite a series of laws and prohibitions against trading by insiders on material non-public information, the academic literature unambiguously suggests that insiders earn abnormal profits on their stock transactions. In general, the literature suggests that purchases (sales) by insiders are followed by positive (negative) abnormal stock returns. Because ordinary investors may benefit from knowledge of insider trading activity, the financial press and investment analysts frequently provide information on recent insider trades. A recent trend emerging from both actions by regulatory authorities and companies is the use of policies that restrict insider trading to time periods following regular news announcements. Several companies have adopted policies (with the SEC's approval) that limit insider transactions to the period immediately after disclosure of the quarterly earnings report. Presumably, the intended effect of such policies is to equalize access to information between insiders and external investors and ensure that the firm's officers comply with insider trading laws. We provide evidence on the incidence and profitability of insider trading following quarterly earnings announcements. If policies to restrict insider trading to the post-earnings disclosure period induce insiders to delay what otherwise would be profitable trades, we would expect: (1) the incidence of insider trading will increase after quarterly earnings disclosure; (2) post-announcement insider purchases (sales) will be preceded by positive (negative) abnormal returns, consistent with foregone trading profits; and (3) no systematic abnormal returns will follow these trades if public disclosure erodes any informational advantage possessed by insiders. Our analysis indicates that insider trading increases immediately after quarterly earning disclosure, but these trades are not associated with foregone trading profits. Consistent with this finding, there is no positive association between post-earnings disclosure insider positions and earnings forecast errors, as would be expected if insiders delayed purchases (sales) prior to positive (negative) earnings news. Our evidence also indicates that a substantial number of insiders buy (sell) after unfavorable (favorable) earnings news, suggesting that insider trading actions incorporate information not revealed by earnings announcements. We also find that post-earnings disclosure trades are associated with significant abnormal returns following trade execution. Overall, our analyses suggest that stock price behavior associated with insider trades following earnings announcements is not substantively different from the results documented in numerous prior studies using broader samples of insider trades. These results suggest that policies limiting periods of acceptable insider trading likely alter when trades occur, but they do not eliminate insider trading profits. These policies also do not appear to impose significant opportunity costs in terms of foregone trading profits for insider trades actually executed. This conclusion, however, is conditional since we cannot observe the effects of such policies on insider trades that could have been executed but were not.

4,"Pope Francis told European anti-money laundering experts Thursday that the Vatican was committed to clean finance, as he denounced financial speculation amid a spiraling corruption investigation in the heart of the Holy See.

It is rare for a head of state to meet with the Council of Europe's Moneyval teams, who make periodic on-site visits to member states to evaluate their adherence to international standards to fight money-laundering and terrorist financing.

But amid the Vatican's own financial scandal, which has exposed the Holy See's ineptitude in investing and managing donations from the faithful, Francis received the dozen members of the Moneyval team in a private audience in his library in the Apostolic Palace.

Citing Jesus' efforts to cast out the merchants from the temple, Francis praised the evaluators' work and policies aimed at monitoring movements of money and of intervening in cases where irregular or even criminal activities are detected.

The measures that you are evaluating are meant to promote a 'clean finance', in which the merchants are prevented from speculating in that sacred temple which, in accordance with the Creator's plan of love, is humanity, Francis said.

The pope didn't mention the scandal in his own backyard, but it couldn't have been far from the evaluators' minds given the headlines of recent weeks and months that have thrown the Vatican into chaos.

Francis last month fired the former No. 2 in the secretariat of state, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, after revelations that he wired 100,000 euros (USD 117,000) in Holy See funds to a charity controlled by his brother. Becciu also recommended the Italian bishops' conference donate some 300,000 euros to the same fund.

Becciu has admitted he sent the money and made the recommendation, but denied any wrongdoing and insisted that the money was meant for the charity, not his brother.

Becciu's ouster came amid an investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the secretariat of state's investment into a luxury London real estate venture that to date has cost the Vatican 350 million euros, much of it donations from the faithful.

Becciu was involved in the initial investment, but his successor - the current No. 2 in the secretariat of state - actually authorized payments of tens of millions of euros in fees to the allegedly unscrupulous middlemen most implicated in the venture.

Vatican prosecutors have been investigating the London investment for over a year, but haven't handed down any indictments. Given Vatican officials signed contracts giving voting control and management fees to the middlemen, it's unclear what if any crimes might have been committed.

Italian newspapers have been rife with reports about the Vatican's other financial investments, including in risky, speculative funds controlled by the middlemen.

Francis has previously defended the Vatican's decision to invest donations in real estate, saying that keeping the money in a safe wouldn't generate necessary interest to keep the capital from losing its value.

But Francis has also denounced the profit-at-all-cost mentality of today's global economy, and cited his own documents denouncing financial speculation and the idolatry of money that has taken root.

Sometimes, in the effort to amass wealth, there is little concern for where it comes from, the more or less legitimate activities that may have produced it, and the mechanisms of exploitation that may be behind it, he told the Moneyval evaluators Thursday.

Thus, situations can occur where, in touching money, we get blood on our hands, the blood of our brothers and sisters.

5,"What Is Tax Evasion?

Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a true tax liability. Those caught evading taxes are generally subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.

Understanding Tax Evasion

Tax evasion applies to both the illegal nonpayment as well as the illegal underpayment of taxes. Even if a taxpayer fails to submit appropriate tax forms, the IRS can still determine if taxes were owed based on the information required to be sent in by third parties, such as W-2 information from a personâs employer or 1099s. Generally, a person is not considered to be guilty of tax evasion unless the failure to pay is deemed intentional.

Tax evasion occurs when a person or business illegally avoids paying their tax liability, which is a criminal charge thatâs subject to penalties and fines.

Failure to pay proper taxes can lead to criminal charges. In order for charges to be levied, it must be determined that the avoidance of taxes was a willful act on the part of the taxpayer. Not only can a person be liable for payment of any taxes that have been left unpaid, but they can also be found guilty of official charges and may be required to serve jail time. According to the IRS, the penalties include jail time of no more than five years, a fine of no more than $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for corporations, or bothâalong with the costs of prosecution.

Requirements for Tax Evasion

When determining if the act of failure to pay was intentional, a variety of factors are considered. Most commonly, a taxpayerâs financial situation will be examined in an effort to confirm if the nonpayment was the result of committing fraud or of the concealment of reportable income.

A failure to pay may be judged fraudulent in cases where a taxpayer made efforts to conceal assets by associating them with a person other than themselves. This can include reporting income under a false name and Social Security number (SSN), which can also constitute identity theft. A person may be judged as concealing income for failure to report work that did not follow traditional payment recording methods. This can include acceptance of a cash payment for goods or services rendered without reporting them properly to the IRS during a tax filing.

In most cases of corporate tax evasion listed on the IRS website, the tax liability was underrepresented. Many business owners undervalued the sums of their receipts to the agency, an act which was deemed to be the purposeful evasion of tax. These were documented to be sources of income, revenue, and profits that were not accurately reported.

Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance

While tax evasion requires the use of illegal methods to avoid paying proper taxes, tax avoidance uses legal means to lower the obligations of a taxpayer. This can include efforts such as charitable giving to an approved entity or the investment of income into a tax deferred mechanism, such as an individual retirement account (IRA). In the case of an IRA, taxes on the invested funds are not paid until the funds, and any applicable interest payments, have been withdrawn.",nam
6,"One of the Trump administrationâs most controversial figures will be assuming a high-ranking role at the Pentagon after acting undersecretary of defense for policy James Anderson resigned on Tuesday, continuing a post-election purge at the Department of Defense thatâs already included the ouster of Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller announced Tuesday that Anthony Tata, the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, would be taking over as the departmentâs top policy official.

âEffective immediately, and while the position of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is vacant and there is no Acting Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Mr. Anthony Tata, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, is delegated the authority of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and is directed to perform the duties of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy,â Miller wrote in a memo.

A retired Army brigadier general who went on to become a novelist and Trump-defending commentator on Fox News, Tata also earned himself a reputation as a notorious conspiracy theorist. But that didnât stop President Donald Trump from appointing Tata as the undersecretary of defense for policy in June. Soon thereafter, however, confirmation hearings were cancelled and Tataâs nomination was pulled after CNNâs K-File team revealed a series of Islamophobic tweets posted by Tata, including several involving former President Barack Obama. He was later given a role at the Defense Department that did not require Senate confirmation.

Per the K-File report, Tata said Islam was the âmost oppressive violent religion I know ofâ and called Obama a âterrorist leaderâ who did more to harm the United States âand help Islamic countries than any president in history.â

The retired brigadier general also categorized Obamaâs foreign policy as being âborn of the Jeremiah Wright school of hate Americaâ and accused the nationâs first Black president of harboring a âWeather Undergroundâ philosophy, referring to the anti-war domestic terrorist group that bombed government buildings in the 1970s.

Tata drew also fire for attacking former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan as a âformer communistâ who âmanipulated ISIS intelligenceâ for the Obama administration.

âI think that John Brennan is a clear and present danger and a threat to this nation. He supports the overthrow of this particular president and he needed to have his access to information revoked,â Tata said during a 2018 interview with Fox News.

Twitter also once removed one of Tataâs tweets saying that former CIA Director Brennan should commit suicide. In a May 2018 tweet directed at Brennan, Tata wrote: âMight be a good time to pick your poison: firing squad, public hanging, life sentence as prison b*tch, or just suck on your pistol. Your call.â He also included hashtags for âtreason,â âsedition,â âCrossfire Hurricane,â and âObamagate.â

While taking on the Pentagonâs third-highest ranking role, Tata may perform all of the duties except for those that qualify as âstatutory dutiesâ under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which âmust be referred to the Secretary of Defense with a recommended course of action,â per Millerâs memo. However, Tata cannot use an âactingâ title and will instead be referred to as âPerforming the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.â",nam
7,"The fintech Modulr has today launched Confirmation of Payee, a fraud prevention initiative spearheaded by Pay.UK, it is officially the first non-bank or building society to do so.

The feature provides an extra layer of defence to protect Modulrâs customers from malicious redirect payment fraud, also known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud. This is the second Modulr product launch to come out of its Â£10m grant from the Capability and Innovation Fund (CIF) under the RBS Alternative Remedies package. Modulr, an authorised electronic money institution, is the first non-bank or building society to join Confirmation of Payee after the mandated institutions.

APP fraud describes when a person is tricked into approving a payment to a fraudsterâs account, through social engineering, manipulation or deceit. These scams cost businesses and consumers millions every year â and thereâs often little recourse to get back stolen money.

Thatâs because with push payments, users enter the beneficiaryâs details and thereâs an assumption of trust before the payment is made â as opposed to pull payments such as card-present payments where the user is generally protected by chargeback rights, or Direct Debits.

With Confirmation of Payee, Modulrâs customers will have greater assurance their payments are going to the right recipient when theyâre paying a business or personal account. Confirmation of Payee calls on Modulrâs API and automatically checks that the recipientâs name and account details match the information held by their payment service provider.

If the details donât match, the user will be warned so they can confirm the details with the person or organisation theyâre trying to pay. Not only does this help protect against fraud, it also helps to avoid simple mistakes like accidentally mistyping account details when setting up a beneficiary.

The benefits for businesses will be significant. Confirmation of Payee can dramatically reduce the risk of direct financial losses incurred by fraud. It can also save operational costs by reducing the number of payments that need to be investigated or recalled.

Confirmation of Payee will be a powerful tool in industries such as lending. Lenders often rely on bank validation tools to protect themselves against fraud â but these are expensive, can become outdated, and are easy for fraudsters to opt-out of. Confirmation of Payee provides a much more reliable and cost-effective alternative, as it draws on the payeeâs bank data in real-time.

Confirmation of Payee will also have a strong impact in the alternative banking sector. Neobanks are fighting two battles when it comes to fraud â they must protect their customers from becoming victims of scams and prevent customers from using their accounts to commit fraud. CoP can help to fight back against both, protecting the reputation of neobanks and their customers.

Myles Stephenson, Chief Executive and founder of Modulr, says: âWeâre committed to delivering the very latest innovation in payments to our customers, and Iâm delighted that we are the first non-bank or building society to offer Confirmation of Payee. Thousands of consumers and businesses fall victim to social engineering scams every year in the UK. Modulr is always looking for ways to help our customers keep their money safe.

âWeâre pleased to announce the launch of Confirmation of Payee offers greater assurance to businesses and consumers when making payments. This is a crucial step forward in the ongoing battle against fraud and itâs going to help us build a safer payments ecosystem in the UK.â

Brian Cunnington, SME for the CoP project team, Pay.UK says: âWe are delighted to see Confirmation of Payee now making a difference in the UK payments environment. The new service offers protection for consumers through the account name checking service, reducing errors and fraudulent misdirection of funds.â",nam
8,"Grand corruption and impunity go hand in hand. Powerful perpetrators involved in massive corruption schemes can too often stymie enforcement against them by interfering with the justice system. Furthermore, investigations are complex and expensive. Grand corruption often crosses borders, involving public and private sector actors in schemes across multiple jurisdictions.

To tackle this âimpunity problemâ, members of the international anti-corruption community are thinking about reforms to international justice institutions. There is currently a unique opportunity to pursue a âbig ideaâ ahead of the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) against Corruption in April 2021. Among the ideas being floated, the Government of Colombia and US Judge Mark Wolf have proposed creation of an international anti-corruption court with jurisdiction over grand corruption cases where countries themselves are unable or unwilling to pursue them.

A range of possible solutionsâ¦

The proposal for a stand-alone court deserves careful study. So too, do six other potential reforms to the international criminal law infrastructure.

Extending the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Regional anti-corruption courts, similar to regional human rights courts that already exist. This is under consideration in Africa under the Malabo Protocol and in discussions at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
International or regional anti-corruption prosecutors or enforcement agenciesâ the new European Prosecutorâs Office provides an example of how that might work.
International or regional investigative agencies â an example of this is the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre established by the UK in July 2017.
A framework for ad hoc international anti-corruption courts, focused on one country. This could follow the models of the international criminal tribunals for atrocities in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone and Cambodia.
A framework for ad hoc international prosecution or investigative functions, focused on one country. A salient example is the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) set up by the United Nations in 2006.

This is a complex subject that needs in-depth study and multi-stakeholder discussion over an extended period. We need to evaluate the options, and possible combinations of options, according to a range of criteria, including political feasibility, effectiveness and cost â criteria that are to some extent interconnected. One benefit of the proposal for an international anti-corruption court is to draw attention to key questions and help catalyse much needed discussions.

â¦but do we understand the problem?

As a first step in that discussion, it would be important to analyse and discuss the problem of grand corruption and its precise manifestations and challenges. This means first analysing the type of criminal activity, the negative impact, and the reason for impunity.

Transparency International has been working with a group of experts to develop a new legal definition of grand corruption: a definition that captures the problem we are trying to deal with when discussing new infrastructure. We define grand corruption as having three main features: a corruption scheme; involvement of a high level public official; and serious harm caused, which may take the form of large-scale misappropriation of public resources or gross violations of human rights.

The kind of definition we are developing could be used to trigger the jurisdiction of an international anti-corruption court or another specialised body or mechanism. Another option would be to introduce it at national level, in association with special procedural measures relating to jurisdiction, statutes of limitation, immunities, sanctions, standing for victims and the like. Both approaches should be considered in efforts to reach international agreement on tackling grand corruption impunity.

A definition is an essential starting point for discussions about infrastructure.

A UN expert working group would help

Grand corruption has devastating impacts on people worldwide, blocking achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. [1] It is high time for UN Member States to get serious about it and follow up on the recommendations agreed by a UN expert group in the Oslo Statement of June 2019. [2] In June this year, UNCAC States Parties will start negotiations in Vienna on the political declaration to be adopted by the UNGASS against Corruption next year. That declaration should mandate creation of a UN expert working group to oversee a programme of research and analysis and to propose options for new mechanisms and agreements to counter grand corruption and ensure the missing accountability.

9,"The Juncker Commission has made the fight against tax avoidance, money laundering and terrorism financing one of its priorities.

Today, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive enters into force. It strengthens the existing rules and will make the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing more effective. It also improves transparency to prevent tax avoidance. This entry into force comes as discussions with the European Parliament and the Council on extra measures further reinforcing the Directive are already at an advanced stage.

Today the Commission also publishes a report which will support Member State authorities in better addressing money laundering risks in practice. As required by the new directive, the Commission assessed the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of different sectors and financial products. The report published today identifies the areas most at risk and the most widespread techniques used by criminals to launder illicit funds.

Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President said: ""Laundered money is oxygen to crime, terrorism and tax-avoidance. We need to cut off its supply as best we can. Today's stronger rules are a big step forward but we now need quick agreement on the further improvements the Commission proposed last July.""

VÄra JourovÃ¡, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality said: âTerrorists and criminals still find ways to finance their activities and to launder illicit gains back into the economy. The new rules as of today are crucial to closing further loopholes. I urge all Member States to put them in place without delay: lower standards in one country will weaken the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing across the EU. I also call for quick agreement on the further revisions proposed by the Commission following the ""Panama Papers"" to increase transparency of beneficial ownership.""

Strengthening the existing rules

The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering  reinforces the existing rules by introducing the following changes:

reinforcing the risk assessment obligation for banks, lawyers, and accountants;
setting clear transparency requirements about beneficial ownership for companies. This information will be stored in a central register, such as commercial registers, and will be available to national authorities and obliged entities
facilitating cooperation and exchange of information between Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money to prevent and detect crime or terrorist activities;
establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules;
reinforcing the sanctioning powers of competent authorities.
In July 2016, the Commission adopted a proposal to further reinforce these EU rules on anti-money laundering to counter terrorist financing and increase transparency about who really owns companies and trusts. The Commission calls on the European Parliament and the Council to finalise this legislative work as soon as possible, so the new rules can enter into force quickly. Building on the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, these new rules will create a robust EU anti-money laundering framework.

Improving the risk assessment across the internal market

The Supranational Risk Assessment Reportis a tool to help Member States identify, analyse and address money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It analyses the risks in the financial and non-financial sector and looks also into newly emerging risks such as virtual currencies or crowdfunding platforms. The report includes:  

an extensive mapping of risks per relevant area and a list of the means more frequently used by criminals to launder money.
recommendations to Member States how to address identified risks appropriately, for example by putting more emphasis on risk analysis or supervisory actions on specific activities.
Finally the Commission also commits to examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units.

Next steps

On the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive

The Member States should have notified the transposition of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive by today, 26 June 2017. The European Commission will now check the state of the transposition and follow up swiftly with Member States in case they have not taken the necessary measures yet.

On the Supranational Risk Assessment Report

The Commission will carry out the necessary actions outlined in the report, including examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units through specific EU rules. It will also engage with Member States to monitor the implementation of the recommendations.

The Commission will continue reviewing the evolution of Anti-Money Laundry/Counter Financing Terrorism risks and will issue a new assessment of those risks at the latest by June 2019 and every two years thereafter.

Background

The new anti-money laundering framework consists of two legal instruments (IP/15/5001): âThe Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive' and âthe Fund Transfers Regulation', both adopted on 20 May 2015.

In July 2016, the Commission presented a proposal to better counter the financing of terrorism and to ensure increased transparency of financial transactions following the so-called ""Panama Papers"" revelations (IP/16/2380). These amendments aim at ensuring a high level of safeguards for financial flows from high-risk third countries, enhancing the access of Financial Intelligence Units to information, including centralised bank account registers, and tackling terrorist financing risks linked to virtual currencies and pre-paid cards. The proposal is currently in negotiations in the Council and the European Parliament and is expected to be adopted in the course of 2017.",nam
10,"Tougher laws to make bribery and corruption a corporate offence. Oman is to introduce tougher powers to clamp down on bribery and corruption after it signed up to the UN Convention against Corruption, a legal expert has said.

The Sultanate has seen a number of high-profile corruption trials in recent years â including one which saw the founder of the countryâs biggest publicly-listed construction company, Galfar, sentenced to three years in jail - a decision he has appealed.

Jamie Kellick of international law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, said one major effect of the new legislation will be to make corruption and bribery in the workplace a corporate offence. Under current legislation it is only a personal offence.

Kellick said that for companies to minimise risk of falling foul of the new legislation they need to ensure that they are complying with the following categories: proportionate procedures; top-level commitment; risk assessment; due diligence; communication and training; monitoring and review; and reporting.

âIt must be led from the management. The recent corruption cases of last year and this year, itâs all very well if a company turns around and says we had a rogue officer itâs got nothing to with the company, itâs just a very unfortunate incident that heâs run off with a whole load of money,â  he said at the CW Leaders in Construction Oman in Muscat.

âNow that Oman has signed up to the UN Convention, one thing that I can be very sure is that the legislation is going to change. Itâs going to become as it is in the States and Europe; itâs going to become a corporate offence. So there is going to be no excuse for companies for not at least attempting to have some procedures in place.â

Kellick said that one of the measures companies can take is to ensure their contracts with subcontractors, suppliers and third parties contain a âright to auditâ clause.

âThis is actually a big issue because it gives you that ability to undertake that due diligence on the suppliers that you have,â he said. âIf a supplier turns around and takes massive umbrage that you have asked for the right to audit then theyâre not the supplier for you.

âYou want to do that trickle down affect,â he added. âYou want to see in their contract that they have the right to audit the subcontractor below them.â

Kellick said that firms would have to demonstrate that they are activity putting procedures in place to curb bribery and corruption.

âNot only do you have to put in the procedures and practices, you actually have to enforce them through training and actually informing your employees and your suppliers and your third parties that this is now the norm and not the exception,â he said.

11,"The professionâs reputation has gone through the mill recently. There were the Home Office slurs about activist immigration lawyers. The Daily Mail followed up with a headline about âUK lawyers who coach asylum seekers to help them avoid deportationâ. There have also been recent press reports mentioning big London law firms in relation to money laundering investigations.

But what should worry solicitors most was the account in the Financial Times of its exposure of the massive Wirecard fraud. It makes for shocking reading, was widely circulated and praised on social media, with well-known figures giving solicitors an extra kick as they retweeted it.

Here is one such kick: âThe habit of major London law firms working for nefarious foreign individuals and companies to immediately question the motives and character of journalists for a standard request for comment never ceases to amazeâ.

First, the background to the scandal which is continuing to shake the German government and its regulators. Wirecard was one of Germanyâs fintech success stories, a payment processor and financial services provider that was part of the DAX index. After riding high for so long, it filed for insolvency in June after â¬1.9bn in cash was found to be missing from its accounts.

Its crash is due to the FT and its investigative journalists, who, through the evidence of whistleblowers and its own relentless digging, and in the face of enormous intimidation, eventually came to the truth.

The German parliament recently announced its own full inquiry into the scandal. This is hardly surprising given that the former chief executive is awaiting trial for fraud and embezzlement, which he denies, and the countryâs chief financial regulator, BaFin, is embarrassed, having filed criminal complaints against the FT journalists, which have of course now been dropped.

But it is the role of English law firms which should make solicitors think. Indeed, there is one sentence in journalist Dan McCrumâs account of the intimidation that he suffered in unearthing the scandal that should send a chill down our spines:

âObservers of the Wirecard affair have tended to criticise the German establishment for the fact that this fraud ran for 20 years unchecked â poor auditing, zero regulatory oversight. And yet almost all the external professionals hired by the company to protect its reputation were based in London.â

In other words, although the company running the fraud was a German company regulated in Germany, it hired English solicitors, by whom the FT felt ferociously intimidated. The company accused the journalist of acting in cahoots with short-sellers to run down Wirecardâs share price for financial benefit. Or, as the journalist wrote: âWe had learnt what to expect from scrutinising the company: furious online abuse, hacking, electronic eavesdropping, physical surveillance and some of Londonâs most expensive lawyers.â The lawyers are seen by the FT on the same level as the other intimidation.

More than one English law firm was involved. One wrote that âour client has recently obtained evidence in the form of an audio recording, which has been provided to the criminal authorities in the UK and Germany, showing that the publication foreshadowed by Mr McCrumâs email is intended to form part of a short-selling strategy and that its forthcoming publication has already been communicated to short sellersâ. The short-selling allegation was untrue.

I have written about reputation laundering by London law firms before in another context, when English PEN wrote in relation to circumstances surrounding the murdered Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia: âOur inquiries have, however, brought to light the growing problems and a unique set of new challenges faced by media outlets and journalists in the UK and internationally from law firms seeking to chill investigations, and manage reputations of wealthy clients, at a time when an increasing number of complex and politically important investigations are conducted by independent reporters.â

I know the justifications. Everyone has a right to a lawyer, even those committing fraud. Solicitors do not know if every fact alleged by a client is true. Lawyers should not be confused with their clientâs interest. And, most importantly, I have seen no evidence of solicitor impropriety.

But the reality in this case is that it has confirmed in the mind of journalists and others that big London firms are being used by criminals to launder their reputation and to intimidate others.

This is a problem for us, which we must confront.",am
12,"Indonesian Military (TNI) soldiers reportedly attacked and arrested civilians at a dormitory and nearby houses in Jayapura after a traffic accident and a quarrel between two dorm inhabitants and a soldier.

Human Rights Lawyers Association for Papua (PAHAM Papua) director Gustav Kawer said the TNI personnelâs action was a crime and a violation of human rights, because it was committed outside TNI jurisdiction to arrest people and beat people.

Cenderawasih Military Command spokesperson Lt. Col. Reza Nur Patria confirmed both the traffic accident and the raid but did not confirm the attack. âDuring the quarrel, a member of [Infantry Battalion 751] was assaulted. The soldiers then searched the people who were responsible for the assault and detained five people for questioning,â he said.

Reza added that, following the internal probe at Army Infantry Battalion (Yonif) 751 headquarters, the five people were sent to Jayapura Police for further investigation. âThe soldier who was a victim of beatings has also reported to the police,â he said.

âIf any [TNI] member is proven to have violated the law, he will be sanctioned in accordance with the law,â said Reza.

On Wednesday night, a soldier on a motorbike allegedly hit another motorbike, on which Meky Suhuniap and Olun Yoal, both Soloitma dorm inhabitants, were riding in Sentani, near the dorm. The three got into an argument before other residents in the location hit the soldier and seized his motorcycle as a guarantee, so that the soldier would pay for the damage.

According to PAHAM Papua, at 11 p.m., more than 50 members of Yonif 751 in Sentani raided the Soloitma dorm, bringing weapons such as bayonets and swords. The soldiers allegedly hit residents, destroyed doors and took residentsâ motorcycles.

One of the residents, Demisian Kobak, 18, was reportedly kicked, even though she had said she was not involved in the quarrel and had told the soldiers she was sick. She was then brought to the hospital for treatment but died the next morning.

âA girl [Demisian] was lying sick in her bed when the soldiers kicked her. She died on Thursday,â PAHAM Papua director Gustav told The Jakarta Post on Friday.

Moreover, the Yonif 751 Sentani members also allegedly attacked eight other people during the raid, namely Edi Kobak, Nation Suhuniap, Nus Suhuniap, Simson Suhuniap, Mince Kobak, Laura Yoal, Pinet Bahabol and 2-year-old Yotam Kobak. The soldiers then took six of them to the headquarters for investigation, PAHAM Papua explained.

âEdi Kobak was kicked, hit in the face and struck on the head with a gunâs muzzle. Penet Bahabol received the same treatment while his hands were tied. As a result, both Edi and Penet sustained bruises to their bodies and faces and were bleeding at the head,â PAHAM Papua lawyer Yohanes Mambrasar said.

After a few hours, the soldiers transferred the six Papuans to the Jayapura Police. At 2 a.m. Thursday, police sent them home.

Gustav of PAHAM said the soldiers had allegedly violated Article 351 of the Criminal Code on maltreatment or physical abuse and Article 38 of TNI Law No. 34 2004 on the soldierâs code of conduct.

PAHAM Papua called on the Jayapura Police to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators and demanded that the TNI hold civil court cases and dismiss the TNI members that committed the alleged crimes.",am
13,"Position under Edward VI and Mary

With her fatherâs death in 1547 and the accession to the throne of her frail 10-year-old brother Edward, Elizabethâs life took a perilous turn. Her guardian, the dowager queen Catherine Parr, almost immediately married Thomas Seymour, the lord high admiral. Handsome, ambitious, and discontented, Seymour began to scheme against his powerful older brother, Edward Seymour, protector of the realm during Edward VIâs minority. In January 1549, shortly after the death of Catherine Parr, Thomas Seymour was arrested for treason and accused of plotting to marry Elizabeth in order to rule the kingdom. Repeated interrogations of Elizabeth and her servants led to the charge that even when his wife was alive Seymour had on several occasions behaved in a flirtatious and overly familiar manner toward the young princess. Under humiliating close questioning and in some danger, Elizabeth was extraordinarily circumspect and poised. When she was told that Seymour had been beheaded, she betrayed no emotion.

The need for circumspection, self-control, and political acumen became even greater after the death of the Protestant Edward in 1553 and the accession of Elizabethâs older half sister Mary, a religious zealot set on returning England, by force if necessary, to the Roman Catholic faith. This attempt, along with her unpopular marriage to the ardently Catholic king Philip II of Spain, aroused bitter Protestant opposition. In a charged atmosphere of treasonous rebellion and inquisitorial repression, Elizabethâs life was in grave danger. For though, as her sister demanded, she conformed outwardly to official Catholic observance, she inevitably became the focus and the obvious beneficiary of plots to overthrow the government and restore Protestantism. Arrested and sent to the Tower of London after Sir Thomas Wyattâs rebellion in January 1554, Elizabeth narrowly escaped her motherâs fate. Two months later, after extensive interrogation and spying had revealed no conclusive evidence of treason on her part, she was released from the Tower and placed in close custody for a year at Woodstock. The difficulty of her situation eased somewhat, though she was never far from suspicious scrutiny. Throughout the unhappy years of Maryâs childless reign, with its burning of Protestants and its military disasters, Elizabeth had continually to protest her innocence, affirm her unwavering loyalty, and proclaim her pious abhorrence of heresy. It was a sustained lesson in survival through self-discipline and the tactful manipulation of appearances.

Many Protestants and Roman Catholics alike assumed that her self-presentation was deceptive, but Elizabeth managed to keep her inward convictions to herself, and in religion as in much else they have remained something of a mystery. There is with Elizabeth a continual gap between a dazzling surface and an interior that she kept carefully concealed. Observers were repeatedly tantalized with what they thought was a glimpse of the interior, only to find that they had been shown another facet of the surface. Everything in Elizabethâs early life taught her to pay careful attention to how she represented herself and how she was represented by others. She learned her lesson well.",nam

HSBC's share price has fallen to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations of money laundering.

In 2013 and 2014 the bank allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their scam, leaked secret files show.

HSBC says it has always met its legal duties on reporting such activity.

On Monday in Hong Kong, the shares fell more than 5.3% to close at HK$29.30. In London they fell by a similar amount.

Leaked documents from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world.

Shares in rival banks named in the papers have also been hit. At lunchtime, Standard Chartered and Barclays were down by 5% and 6% respectively, while Germany's Deutsche Bank was down 8%.

The share price falls came against a backdrop of broader negative sentiment on share markets. UK shares were down sharply amid fears of further Covid-related restrictions.

HSBC to speed up 35,000 job cuts as profits slump

HSBC had been under pressure on multiple fronts before the files were leaked and its shares have taken a particularly hard battering this year, falling by some 50%.

It has been at the sharp end of political pressures in Hong Kong, and from the pandemic fallout.

Although HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from Asia and its shares are important components of both the London and Hong Kong share markets.

Its role in a $80m (Â£62m) fraud is detailed inthe FinCEN leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"".

HSBC moved the money through its US business to HSBC accounts in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014.

The bank says it has always reported such activity in accordance with its legal obligations.

Multiple pressures

HSBC, which is Europe's biggest bank, has set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In August, it reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year - much steeper than analysts had forecast.

It also became embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong and was lambasted by both the US and UK.

Cost-cutting

HSBC is currently pushing ahead with major restructuring of its global banking operations.

Chief executive Noel Quinn, who officially took over in March, said the bank would further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money.

Mr Quinn said HSBC would ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which includes the axing of 35,000 jobs.",am
16,"Remessa Online, the Brazilian money transfer service, said it has closed on $20 million in financing from one of the leading Latin American venture capital firms, Kaszek Ventures, and Accel Partnersâ Kevin Efrusy, the architect of the famed venture capital firmâs Latin American investments.

Since its launch in 2016, Remessa Online has provided a pipeline for over $2 billion worth of international transfers for small and medium-sized businesses in the country. The company now boasts over 300,000 customers from 100 countries and says its fees are typically one eighth the cost of the local money transfer options.

âWe understand that transferring money is just the beginning, and we are eager to build a global financial system that will make life easier for global citizens and businesses alike,â Liuzzi said.

Money transfer services are a huge business that startups have spent the last decade trying to improve in Europe and the U.S. European money transfer company, TransferWise has raised over $770 million alone in its bid to unseat the incumbents in the market. Meanwhile, the business-to-business cross-border payment gateway, Payoneer, has raised roughly $270 million to provide those services to small businesses.

Remessa Online already boasts a powerful group of investors and advisors including AndrÃ© Penha, the co-founder of apartment rental company QuintoAndar, and the former chief operating officer of Kraft Heinz USA, Fabio Armaganijan. With the new investment from Kaszek Ventures, firm co-founder Hernan Kazah, also the co-founder of the Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, will take a seat on the companyâs board.

âWe developed an online solution that is faster and substantially cheaper than traditional banking platforms, with digital and scalable processes and omnichannel customer support offered by a team of expertsâ, said Remessa Onlineâs co-founder and strategy director Alexandre Liuzzi, in a statement.

Last year, the company expanded its money transfer service to the U.K. and Europe, allowing Brazilians abroad to invest money, pay for education or rent housing without documentation or paperwork. The companyâs accounts now come with an International Banking Account Number that allows its customers to receive money in nine currencies.

With the new year, Remessa has added additional services for small and medium-sized businesses and expanded its geographic footprint to include Argentina and Chile.

Latin American countries â especially Brazil â have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the economy is still reeling, the broad trends that are moving consumers and businesses to adopt e-commerce and mobile payment solutions are just as pronounced in the region as they are in the U.S., according to investors like Kazah.

âThis crisis is accelerating the digitization process of several industries around the world and Remessa Online has taken the lead to transform the cross-border segment in Brazil, specially for SMBs,â he said in a statement.

Founded in 2016 by Fernando Pavani, Alexandre Liuzzi, Stefano Milo and Marcio William, Remessa Online was born from the founders own needs to find an easier way to send and receive money from abroad, according to the company.

In 2018, after a $4 million investment from Global Founders Capital and MAR Ventures, the company developed international processing capabilities and a more robust compliance tool kit to adhere to international anti-money laundering and know your customer standards. In the latter half of 2019, the company entered the SMB market with the launch of a toolkit for businesses that had been typically ignored by larger financial services institutions in Brazil.

âWe believe in a world without physical borders. Our mission is to help our clients with their global financial needs, so that they can focus on what matters: their international dreams,â said Liuzzi.",nam

18,"Dive Brief:
MasterCard, in its first major deployment of artificial intelligence technology, is rolling out a new decision-scoring and fraud detection service called Decision Intelligence designed to help increase the accuracy of real-time card approvals at checkout, while reducing the likelihood of transactions being falsely declined.

MasterCard said the service relies on proprietary algorithms to provide a predictive score to the card issuer, based on intelligent analysis of how a specific account is used over time to detect normal and abnormal shopping spending behaviors. It also leverages account information like customer value segmentation, risk profiling, location, merchant, device data, time of day and type of purchase made.

Card issuers can incorporate this information into their existing fraud mitigation efforts, or activate a holistic MasterCard fraud-fighting tool that makes data-driven, real-time decisions tailored to the account, including defined alert and decline thresholds.

Dive Insight:
Javelin Strategy & Research estimates that in the U.S. alone, the value of false declines is more than 13 times the total amount lost to actual card fraud. MasterCard notes that more than $118 billion in sales were lost in the U.S. to false declines in 2014, and if you're a retailer or a card issuer, there must be no worse way of losing a customer than having them fall victim to a false decline of a transaction: I'm not sure what response most people would have to being falsely declined, but I know if it happened to me, I wouldn't returning to that retailer or using that card again anytime soon.

Yet while Javelin and MasterCard both note how huge and widespread a problem this has been, the risk assessment tools used to battle it seem woefully inadequate. That is particularly the case when the sector has technology at its disposal that could be used to analyze and weigh many distinct factors involved in any single transaction.

Fraud prevention seems an area ripe for AI to improve on current practices, though surprisingly, we have not heard much from the major card companies until now, even as AI quickly has become a widely studied technology (and somewhat widely deployed, though it's still early) in retail and other industries in which card payments also play an important role. Payments firm Stripe notably launched an AI-based fraud detection service recently, though it didn't specifically mention reduction of false declines as one of its aims.

The card companies certainly have brought new technology to bear in the fight against fraud, most obviously in the form of EMV chip cards, but the apparent immensity of the false decline problem should be a reminder to them that their fraud strategies need to be comprehensive and multi-layered â one advancement doesn't solve all the problems.

Overall, AI not only can improve on current fraud analysis processes, but also evolve over time by using its own machine learning capabilities to continue refining how it views and handles ongoing transactions involving the same customers and payment cards. Ultimately, it can be another tool for improving the customer experience â something it's best to work on before another false decline drives them away.",nam
19,"Imran Khan says he is open to dialogue if Kashmiris are given the right to self-determination as per the UN resolutions.

Islamabad, Pakistan â Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has reiterated that he is prepared to hold talks with neighbouring India only if it lifts its âmilitary siegeâ on Indian-administered Kashmir and gives its residents the right to self-determination.

Khan made the remarks during a short video address released on Tuesday to coincide with the anniversary of the day Indian security forces entered the part of Kashmir it administers in 1947, two months after both India and Pakistan gained independence from the British.

In his speech, Khan said he would engage in dialogue with India only if it took steps to reverse what Pakistan terms New Delhiâs âoccupationâ of Indiaâs only Muslim-majority region.

âI am ready [for talks], but for that, you will need to end the military siege that you have imposed on Kashmir, and the second thing is that you will need to give Kashmiris the right to self-determination as per the United Nationsâ resolutions,â said Khan.

Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer separate portions of it, divided by a Line of Control, across which a tenuous ceasefire has been in place since 2003.


In August 2019, India revoked a constitutional provision that had given Indian-administered Kashmir a measure of autonomy, bringing it into the countryâs administrative and governance mainstream.

The move was accompanied by the influx of tens of thousands of troops into the territory, where an armed separatist movement has raged for years.

A curfew was imposed across the mountainous Himalayan territory, with severe restrictions on public gatherings, communication and other civil liberties and hundreds of people arrested.

The restrictions have continued after the coronavirus pandemic erupted in March.

In his comments on Tuesday, Khan decried what he termed a âmilitary siegeâ of Kashmirâs citizens in Indian-administered Kashmir.

âThey are neither Indian citizens, and neither do they have the right of self-determination that was given by the United Nations Security Council,â he said.

In 1948, the UN Security Council passed a resolution mandating that both sides cease hostilities to pave the way for a plebiscite where Kashmiris would be given the right to choose between joining either Pakistan or India.

But New Delhi has continued to tighten its control over the Muslim-majority region with a large military presence and a series of legislation aimed at suppressing the separatist voices.

Khanâs statement on Tuesday coincided with India enacting new laws that allow any Indian national to buy land in Indian-administered Kashmir, spurring allegations about New Delhi planning a demographic change in the region.

20,"Banks have given a cautious welcome to US moves to overhaul the countryâs approach to the enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) controls. The proposal is viewed by lenders as an acknowledgment that the current system for stemming the flow of illicit finance isnât working, and that itâs in need of reform.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency (FinCen), a unit of the US Treasury, issued a proposed rule on September 17, calling on banks to develop âeffective and reasonably designedâ AML",nam
21,"In September 2015, world leaders from 193 UN member states gathered in New York to adopt the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To achieve this universal agenda, weâll need robust and transparent investment in infrastructure to lay the physical foundations for progress on many of the goals.

Agenda 2030 aims for a world that is profoundly different from the one we know today: free from poverty, environmentally secure for future generations, prosperous, more equal, just, peaceful and inclusive, and better governed. Corruption in the infrastructure sector represents a major threat to this vision.

These were among the challenges debated at a recent International Conference on Public Construction Transparency, organised by the United Nations Development Programme in partnership with the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea.

Sustainable Development Goal 9 on resilient infrastructure and sustainable industralization is the most direct commitment to accountable investments in the construction sector. Other goals â such those on education, health, water and sanitation, climate change, energy, sustainable cities or the conservation of ecosystems â will all require important infrastructure developments to reach their targets.

According to the OECD, emerging economies alone will need US$22 trillion of investments in infrastructure over the next 10 years. The Global Construction 2030 report forecasts that the value of global construction will reach $17.5 trillion by 2030.

Transparency International warns that up to one third of this investment could be lost to corruption. Data from the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST) further suggests that a similar amount could be wasted through mismanagement and inefficiency. These figures are staggering.

Quality infrastructure is positively related to human development. In contrast, high levels of corruption in the construction sector can lead to the wrong decisions on the kind of infrastructure needed, excessively high prices being paid for construction design and implementation. It can also result in poor quality of construction materials, which can lead to disasters and loss of human lives. There is also growing evidence that high levels of corruption and the injustice that comes with it, fuel social tensions and conflict.

Given the magnitude of potential losses to corruption in the infrastructure sector, mounting to trillions of dollars annually on a global scale, clean construction is also of paramount importance for achieving Goal 16 on building peaceful, just and inclusive societies. It will indeed not be possible to have peace and security when corruption siphons of trillions of tax payersâ money and development funds. This deprives communities of important development dividends, denying justice, safety, security and services to a large portion of the population.

Targets 16.4 and 16.5 therefore put the fight against corruption and illicit financial flows at the centre of the peace and development agenda. There can be no development without peace, and there can be no peace without development. We will fail on both these aspirations, if we remain unable to substantively reduce all forms of corruption.

Quality infrastructure can transform economies, boost employment, provide safer environments and improve lives. Investments in fighting corruption in public infrastructure therefore guarantee important returns in human development. Increased transparency and accountability in the construction sector is thus a sine qua non for a successful outcome of the 2030 development agenda.",nam
22,"Lawyers, compliance professionals and senior management at companies can be obsessive when it comes to the threat of criminal liability. Please do not get me wrong, I am not minimizing the risk of criminal prosecution, nor I am suggesting that everyone go out and start paying bribes overseas.

That being said, it is important to keep things in perspective. The most significant FCPA prosecutions â Siemens, Daimler, KBR, Weatherford and others â were the result of âsystemicâ breakdowns in compliance, meaning that there was little to no ethical culture or any attempt to control the behavior of managers and employees so long as they were producing, making money for the company.

A culture of lawlessness does not just spring up one day in response to the behavior of a few individuals. Rather, like a cancer, it grows and spreads, eventually taking over the organization. Such a disease can only spread in the right environment. That is, when it comes down to culture; if there is no commitment to ethics, it does not matter how many policies you have or the controls that are developed, the company will inevitably choose the wrong road.

What I have described is one extreme. If your company makes good faith attempts to design and implement an ethics and compliance program, with a commitment from leadership and the Board, chances are that the worst result you could ever face would be a problem in a country or region, especially if the country or region was acquired but never fully integrated into the home company.

For a company to be considered a âcriminal,â it has to act like a criminal â meaning secrecy, evil intent and all the surrounding attributes of a criminal.

That is why I stress two important values for a company â act in good faith by documenting everything you do and the rationale behind any action, and act transparently. Companies that adhere to good faith and transparency are not acting with the requisite criminal intent.

This is a point that is worth stressing â even in the face of significant risks, if a company acts in good faith and transparently, there is little likelihood that it can ever be prosecuted criminally.

So what about the rogue employee who does act with criminal intent, hiding his behavior and seeking to line his pockets with the benefits of bribes?

While a theoretical claim of a ârogueâ employee seems appealing, the truth is there is no such thing as a rogue employee. Everyone in the business points to Morgan Stanley as the perfect example of a rogue employee, but that is plain wrong.

In the Morgan Stanley case, the Justice Department shoehorned the facts (and ignored others) to make an important point â if you build a great compliance program and you suffer an isolated set of violations (not just one person but an office, division or region), we may decline to prosecute the entire matter.

The powerful message sent by the Justice Department was successful in energizing companies to improve their compliance programs. It was a shrewd and very effective move by the Justice Department, in a very politically risky time.

Even with transparency and good faith, companies still face risks of country-specific or regional operations that may veer off for a little while. No company will ever face a systemic breakdown so long as they have the essential two values needed to avoid a major catastrophe.

The worst-case scenario can still occur â a region or a country may have a breakdown, but those are usually detected, cleaned up and problems fixed. Companies still need to be vigilant in auditing, monitoring and conducting frequent assessments. With that recipe, companies can safely avoid any serious systemic violations.",nam
23,"Nasdaq has announced the launch of the cloud-deployed Nasdaq Automated Investigator for AML, the first automated solution for investigating anti-money laundering (AML) for retail and commercial banks and other financial institutions. Designed, built and offered in partnership with UK-based Caspian. Nasdaq Automated Investigator for AML further expands Nasdaqâs global efforts in combatting financial crime and promoting market integrity in the capital markets and beyond.

âThe financial industry is making a structural shift to more intelligent technologies and real-time adaptive analytics based on much larger, more diverse data pools to detect and investigate financial crime,â said Valerie Bannert-Thurner, SVP and Head of Sell-side and Buy-side Solutions, Market Technology, Nasdaq. âAs both a market operator and technology provider, we have a commitment to the capital market ecosystem to keep markets healthy and safe to fight financial crime. Through the years of expertise we have gained as an industry leader in trade surveillance, we are both moving beyond our alerting capabilities to investigation, and expanding our solutions to help eradicate illegal money transactions.â

The Automated Investigations Management space is a historically underserviced area of financial crime operations that presents a significant gap in the investigations management process for banks. Many techniques are used to launder money, causing banks to cast a wide net to catch perpetrators. The wide scope of surveillance means AML Transaction Monitoring (AMLTM) systems could potentially trigger as many as 200,000 to 300,000 alerts a month in extreme cases. In response, many banks have tightened the parameters within their AMLTM systems or added additional scoring mechanisms, thereby reducing alerts. However, when banks tune their models too tightly, they run the risk of missing criminal activity and exposing themselves to regulatory sanction. Even those that have tightened their parameters can experience 20,000 to 25,000 alerts in a month.

To support these efforts, the Nasdaq Automated Investigator ingests alert data from any transaction monitoring system, collates all of the necessary data required for analysis, analyzes the data and then replicates complex human decision making to provide a clear, auditable justification for all alerts regardless of volume, and in seconds. The technology is powered by multiple variants of artificial intelligence including both supervised and unsupervised learning in conjunction with business rules to provide a significant increase in operational efficiency. Beyond AML, Nasdaq sees broad applicability for this new category of solutions that the Nasdaq Automated Investigator has established, and plans to roll out functionality across complementary financial crime segments in the future.

âWe have designed the Nasdaq Automated Investigator to automate the complex stages of an alert investigation process with tools focused on the mechanics and effectiveness of the actual investigation,â said Darren Innes, Head of AML Technology, Sell-Side and Buy-Side Solutions, Nasdaq. âOur solution improves the manually intensive anti-financial crime process by fully automating all stages of the existing manual alert investigation process to deliver accurate, consistent decision-making at scale. This pinpoints the highest-probability of nefarious activity for analysts to prioritize, and provides them a layer of demonstrable explainability that does not currently exist in financial crime investigations.â

Nasdaqâs market technology powers more than 250 of the worldâs market infrastructure organizations and market participants, including broker-dealers, exchanges, clearinghouses, central securities depositories and regulators, in over 50 countries with end-to-end, mission-critical technology solutions.",nam
24,"Marqeta 3D Secure â one of the first solutions to be certified on the Visa 2.2. Standards â is designed to give issuers complete control over their cardholder authentication experience to help reduce risk of fraud.

Marqeta, the worldâs first global modern card issuing platform, announced the release of its new 3D Secure solution. Marqeta 3D Secure will not only help card issuers meet regulatory requirements of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) in certain markets, it will also enable these issuers to create tailored cardholder authentication experiences that can help reduce online fraud. 3D Secure is an authentication protocol developed by the card networks. Marqetaâs 3D Secure solution is one of the first modern solutions to get certified with Visa 2.2. Standards and is designed and built in-house to allow for greater customisation and control over fraud and authentication decisions.

Twisto, a leading digital banking provider in Eastern Europe, is in development to use Marqetaâs 3D Secure solution to authenticate cardholders with complete control and a seamless cardholder experience. Twisto will leverage Marqetaâs open APIs to design an authentication experience that utilises biometrics within its mobile banking app to verify cardholders without having to redirect them to unfamiliar websites or enter passwords. With Marqetaâs 3D Secure, Twisto has the ability to participate in the 3D Secure authentication request if and when they want to challenge a cardholder. This allows them to incorporate their own real-time fraud data to make risk decisions and avoid unnecessary friction for cardholders by allowing exemptions for certain transactions.

âOur customers expect a seamless check-out experience with our mobile app and we knew we needed to find a solution that would allow us to reduce fraud while also providing us full control over the cardholder experience. With Marqetaâs APIs, we were able to easily design the authentication process without adding unnecessary friction to the customer experience and are now positioned to expand into new markets faster and more securely,â says Twisto Founder & CEO, Michal Smida.

3D Secure is a protocol that applies to transactions where the card is not present (CNP) such as online and mobile. Card networks, including Visa and Mastercard, expect issuers to be enabled with 3D Secure and Marqetaâs 3D Secure can help European issuers to comply with the SCA regulatory obligations. Visa and MasterCard are also expected to enforce liability shifts which hold issuers liable for fraud if 3DS has been successfully applied. As online transactions continue to increase in the wake of COVID-19, the need for security like 3D Secure is becoming more essential to help fight against fraud across all markets, and not just those that are regulated by SCA. This includes companies in the United States and other markets where 3DS can be applied for better identity management and fraud protection, and not purely to follow mandates. Marqetaâs 3D Secure solution provides multiple options for companies to integrate depending on their specific authentication needs.

Marqetaâs 3D Secure solution will allow issuers to:

Own and customise the authentication experience for cardholders. â Authenticate and authorize transactions on one unified platform to minimise integration and cost.
Enhance data sharing between parties to better identify cardholders and reduce their friction.

âAs businesses turn to digital payments in the face of COVID-19, fraud has become a prevalent issue for consumers. Itâs imperative that our customers are provided with complete control over their transactions to help combat fraud and deter risk,â says Marqeta Chief Product Officer, Kevin Doerr. âOur single global platform enables advanced authentication methods for card issuers that improve security without compromising the end user experience.â",nam

from the can't-mess-with-the-profits dept

In November of 2011, the TV show 60 Minutes did a big expose on insider trading within Congress. While everyone else is subject to basic insider trading rules, it turned out that members of Congress were exempt from the rules. And, as you would imagine, many in Congress have access to market-moving, non-public information. And they made use of it. To make lots and lots of money. Of course, after that report came out and got lots of attention, Congress had to act, and within months they had passed the STOCK Act with overwhelming support in Congress to make insider trading laws that apply to everyone else finally apply to Congress and Congressional staffers as well. As that link notes:

The lopsided votes showed lawmakers desperate to regain public trust in an election year, when the public approval rating of Congress has sunk below 15 percent.

Of course, here we are in 2013 and, lo and behold, it is no longer an election year. And apparently some of the details of the ban on insider trading were beginning to chafe Congressional staffers, who found it hard to pad their income with some friendly trades on insider knowledge.

So... with very little fanfare, Congress quietly rolled back a big part of the law late last week. Specifically the part that required staffers to post disclosures about their financial transactions, so that the public could make sure there was no insider trading going on. Congress tried to cover up this fairly significant change because they, themselves, claimed that it would pose a ""national risk"" to have this information public. A national risk to their bank accounts.

It was such a national risk that Congress did the whole thing quietly, with no debate. The bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday and quickly voted on late that night when no one was paying attention. Friday afternoon (the best time to sneak through news), the House picked it up by unanimous consent. The House ignored its own promise to give Congress three days to read a bill before holding a vote, because this kind of thing is too important to let anyone read the bill before Congress had to pass it.

And, of course, yesterday, President Obama signed it into law. Because the best way to rebuild trust in Congress, apparently, is to roll back the fact that people there need to obey the same laws as everyone else. That won't lead the public to think that Congress is corrupt. No, not at all.

26,"The Philippine government recently approved a contentious anti-terrorism bill that critics say is aimed at curbing civil liberties and silencing the opposition.

The 2020 Anti-Terrorism Bill is an upgrade of the Human Security Act of 2007, which the military says is outdated and insufficient to fight modern-day terrorism, which involves online recruitment and planning of terrorist activities.

The new measure enables security forces to arrest suspects without a legal warrant, hold them without charges for a longer period of time and wiretap them for up to 90 days. Additionally, there will be an anti-terror council in place to define what constitutes terrorism.

Read more: Dissent unwelcome in the Philippines: Vice President Leni Robredo

The Philippine military backed the new legislation, arguing that the existing anti-terrorism laws are not adequate to build a strong case against a terror suspect.

In a 2018 Senate hearing on the anti-terrorism bill, former army chief General Carlito Galvez Jr said that existing laws only allowed three days to build a case and charge a suspect. As a result, Galvez said, authorities had to release terror suspects.

President Rodrigo Duterte, who was set to sign the bill into law, dubbed it an urgent matter. But the bill could still be challenged in the Southeast Asian country's Supreme Court. According to Antonio Carpio, a retired Supreme Court justice, ""the law deals with fundamental constitutional rights.""


Widespread opposition

The bill was denounced by a large number of people in the Philippines. The hashtag #JunkTerrorBill has started trending on social media, with celebrities, government officials and even business groups expressing concern over it. Many fear the security forces could abuse their wide-ranging powers.

""The bill labels anyone who expresses dissent a terrorist. It will give authorities more reasons to punish Muslims who are wrongfully perceived as terrorists,"" Khads Sarael, a 20-year-old Muslim student who participated in a protest last week, told DW.

Last week, police used force against anti-bill protesters in Cebu and arrested at least seven activists and students.

Supporters of the bill argue that there are enough safeguards in the new legislation to ensure freedom of expression. ""Those who protest peacefully are not terrorists. Our constitution ensures peaceful rallies, as they are protected by the Bill of Rights,"" Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana said in an interview.

But rights activists are not convinced by this argument. They say the Duterte administration's human rights record is abysmal. The international community has been critical of the president's handling of his campaign against drugs, with rights organizations documenting systematic rights abuse, extrajudicial killings and arrests of citizens.

""There are very few safeguards in the law. In reality, we have seen this government's belligerence in dealing with any perceived opposition and its heavy-handedness to silence dissent,"" Kristina Conti of the Public Interest Law Center told DW.

Muslims will be targeted?

Legislators from the insurgency-hit southern Mindanao region have rejected the 2020 Anti-Terrorism Bill, fearing it would increase discrimination against the Muslim community.

""The law won't curb terrorism; it will empower the government to tag opponents as terrorists,"" said House Deputy Speaker Mujiv Hataman.

Hataman represents the southern province of Basilan, which is also the birthplace of the jihadist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG).

""I have dealt with many cases of Muslims who are wrongfully arrested and detained,"" Hataman told DW.

""We support efforts against terrorism, but they should not be at the expense of human rights,"" he added.

Hataman is of the view that terrorism can be eradicated through dialogue, good governance, education and the provision of livelihood opportunities. ""These are the programs that we need. Unfortunately, none of them is mentioned in the Anti-Terrorism Bill.""",nam
27,"New features allow organizations to build online trust and customer loyalty by ensuring the highest levels of security and compliance without sacrificing the customer experience

New facial recognition and document verification technology will enable small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to provide the same level of online protection to their customers as multinational organizations. As part of a holistic approach to identity verification, this new technology will empower SMBs to ensure compliance, become more resilient against cyber attacks and maintain their operations during these challenging times.

Trulioo, the leading global identity verification provider, today announced new document verification and facial recognition features to EmbedID, a low-code developer tool preconfigured to work with GlobalGateway API, the worldâs largest identity verification marketplace. Leveraging independent data sources and integrated identity services worldwide, EmbedID helps small and medium-sized businesses verify users during the account creation process to help meet Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance requirements, increase trust and safety and mitigate fraud risks.

Using EmbedID, SMBs can copy a snippet of code and paste it onto their website to automatically generate a stylized registration form that is prewired to GlobalGateway to instantly verify personal identification information. The new features enable ID documentation verification and biometric authentication for an added layer of security. This empowers SMBs to check the authenticity of government-issued ID documents and use facial recognition with liveness detection to ensure the person creating the account matches the photo on the ID document.

âTaking a multi-layered approach to identity verification offers businesses the strongest defense against increasingly sophisticated bad actors,â said Rutherford Wilson, Director of Growth at Trulioo. âAdding document verification gives another layer of protection to help reduce risk, especially when combined with reliable identity verification. By enabling both of these capabilities, organizations can have increased confidence in knowing the user is tied to a real identity and that they are who they claim to be online.â

Due to budget restraints, SMBs typically have limited access to bank-grade technology and security solutions, making them an easy target for bad actors. This is evidenced by research from Accenture which found that an alarming 43 percent of cyberattacks are aimed at small businesses, while only 14 percent are prepared to defend themselves. In fact, six out of 10 small businesses have no digital defense plan in place, underscoring the need for industry awareness and education, according to Keeper Security 2019 SMB Cyberthreat Study.

âIn an age of ongoing digital transformation, itâs essential for SMBs to be able to access the same identity verification solutions used by large organizations to protect their business and scale their company,â said Wilson. âSadly, 60 percent of small and mid-sized businesses go out of business after an attack, and we designed EmbedID to help level the playing field to allow for accelerated innovation, customer acquisition and competition in the marketplace.â

Following the launch of GlobalGateway in 2014, Trulioo discovered a gap in the market after years of successfully delivering its bank-grade identity verification solution to hundreds of organizations across the globe. With the launch of EmbedID, Trulioo is democratizing access to best-in-class fraud defense technology for organizations of all sizes.

âSMBs tend to have limited IT budgets and KYC/AML compliance expertise,â continued Wilson. âWe wanted to build a solution for SMBs that provides battle-tested identity verification, reduced integration costs for IT departments, and an easy to use administrative portal so non-tech individuals can make updates as requirements change.â",nam
28,"The issue of economic crime recently made the front pages of the UKâs newspapers, when an investigation carried out by investigative journalists shone a light on the role of certain global banks in money laundering.

This has helped re-emphasise the important fight that government and society has against economic crime generally, and money laundering particularly as the government looks to develop its response to how it deals with economic crime.

In July last year, the UK government unveiled its Economic Crime Plan (ECP) 2019 to 2022, which set out the action being taken by the public and private sectors to ensure the UK has a world leading response to this challenge.

The ECP sets the agenda for economic crime reform in the short-to-medium term and is billed as a 'step-change' response, utilising the experience, capabilities and resources of the public and private sectors.

To help fund a number of the initiatives in the ECP, the government announced an economic crime levy on the anti-money laundering (AML) regulated sectors. The government hopes to introduce the levy by 2022/2023 and is looking to raise Â£100 million a year to help tackle money laundering.

A consultation was launched in July and sought views on how it could operate in practice, its design principles and to ensure it is effective and proportionate.

Whist the legal profession has an important role to play in the AML regime and we support the government focus on ensuring the UK has a world leading AML regime, we strongly oppose the levy.

Tackling money laundering benefits society as a whole, but rather than placing an additional tax on those already funding the fight against AML, additional funding should come from the public purse and other sources such as the assets recovered from criminals and AML fines on the regulated sector.

In the event that the government decides to move forward with its plans, we have argued strongly against calculating the levy on the basis of revenue because that has no bearing on the risks a firmâs work poses. Instead, we have argued strongly for a model based on the number of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) a firm submitted the previous year which would be simpler, cheaper to operate and fairer than a revenue-based levy.

We have also argued strongly for an exemption for small firms with revenue of less than Â£10.2 million a year which would see thousands of small firms being exempt from paying the levy. High streets firms are already facing unprecedented the challenges due to Covid-19 and having to pay another levy on top would be completely inappropriate.

The consultation has now closed, and we expect the government to announce the outcomes early next year. In the meantime, we continue to ensure the legal professions views on the issue are well presented with government officials, ministers and wider stakeholders.",nam
29,"Financial crime as a wider category of cybercrime continues to be one of the most potent of online threats, covering nefarious activities as diverse as fraud, money laundering and funding terrorism. Today, one of the startups that has been building data intelligence solutions to help combat that is announcing a fundraise to continue fueling its growth.

Ripjar, a U.K. company founded by five data scientists who previously worked together in British intelligence at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ, the U.K.âs equivalent of the NSA), has raised $36.8 million (Â£28 million) in a Series B, money that it plans to use to continue expanding the scope of its AI platform â which it calls Labyrinth â and scaling the business.

Labyrinth, as Ripjar describes it, works with both structured and unstructured data, using natural language processing and an API-based platform that lets organizations incorporate any data source they would like to analyse and monitor for activity. It automatically and in real time checks these against other data sources like sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEPs) lists and transaction alerts.

Sources close to the company say that the funding values the startup in the region of Â£100 million, or about $127 million. Ripjar is currently profitable, the company confirmed.

The funding is being led by Long Ridge Equity Partners, a specialist fintech investor, with previous investors Winton Capital Ltd. and Accenture plc also participating. Accenture is a strategic partner: the consultancy/systems integrator uses Ripjarâs tech to work with a number of clients in the financial services sector. Ripjar also has government clients, where its platform is used for counterterrorism work. It declined to disclose any specific names, but it does note that its extensive partner list also includes the likes of PWC, BAE Systems, Dow Jones and more.

âWe are excited to partner with Long Ridge who bring expertise and resources in scaling fast-growing software companies,â said Jeremy Annis, who is both the CEO and CTO of Ripjar and co-founded the company with Tom Griffin, Leigh Jones, Robert Biggs and Jeremy Laycock. âThis investment signals enormous confidence in our world-leading data intelligence technology and ability to protect companies and governments from criminal behaviour which threatens their assets and prosperity. With this funding, we will accelerate the expansion of Ripjar worldwide to provide our customers with the most advanced financial crime solutions, as well as creating new iterations of the Labyrinth platform.â

The startup says that itâs had its biggest year yet â no surprise, given the circumstances. Not only has there been huge shift to online transactions in 2020 because of the rise of the COVID-19 global health pandemic, but a tightening of the world economy has led to more financial scrambling and new nefarious activity, as well as criminal acts to profit from the instability.

Thatâs led to inking deals with six new enterprise customers and expanding deals with four existing major clients, and Ripjar said that it now has some 20,000 clients globally.

And if you are curious about the name, as I was, itâs if anything a meta reference to some of the kind of work that Ripjar does.

âIt doesnât mean anything,â a spokesperson said. âIt was created using technology to ensure a name was selected that had never been used before.â

London, as one of the worldâs financial centers, has developed a strong reputation for hatching and growing interesting fintech startups, and that has also meant the U.K. â which also has a strong talent base in artificial intelligence â has become very fertile ground for startups building services to help protect those fintechs.

Ripjarâs raise, and rise, come within months of two other companies building AI to combat fraud and financial crime also raising money and growing. In July, ComplyAdvantage, which has also been building a database and platform to help combat financial crime, announced a $50 million raise. And a week before that, another U.K. company also building AI for financial and other cybercrime detection, Quantexa, raised $64.7 million.

Ripjar counts both of these, as well as bigger targets like Palantir, among its competitors. As is most likely, the big institutions that are grappling with financial crime are most likely using several companiesâ technology at the same time.

It claims to have the more sophisticated approach. âWe believe that Labyrinth is the most advanced solution in the market as weâve developed it after decades of firsthand experience of fighting crime and terrorism within the national security community,â said David Balson, director of Intelligence at Ripjar, in answer to my question about competitors. âThere is no silver bullet in the fight against crime. As such, weâve had to come up with hundreds of innovations to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the vital work that goes on in the financial sector and law enforcement. This includes our world-leading natural language processing (NLP) and identity resolution capabilities, which work over any global language and script, joining the dots automatically between structured data and unstructured text like documents, news reports, web pages and intelligence reports. Itâs a vital tool to help analysts overcome the information overload that is so often associated with the sector.â

Indeed, the silver bullet reference applies to more than just Ripjarâs technology. With the issue of money laundering alone a $2 trillion problem (with only 1-2% of that ever identified and recovered), you can see why, at least for right now, banks, governments and others might be willing to put multiple resources on the problem to try to tackle it.

âFinancial institutions, corporates and government agencies face ever-increasing risks associated with financial crime and cyber threatsâ said Kevin Bhatt, a managing partner at Long Ridge, in a statement. âWe believe Ripjar is well-positioned to provide artificial intelligence solutions that will allow its clients to reduce the cost of compliance, while uncovering new threats through automation. We are incredibly excited to partner with Ripjar to support their continued growth and look forward to working closely with the Ripjar team as they expand to new geographies, customers, and verticals.â",nam
30,"The founder and CEO of the London-based banking startup, Nik Storonsky denied allegations of negligence relating to the companyâs anti-money laundering (AML) software. The Revolut money-laundering investigation has been on the spotlight after that.

The article was updated on 31 December, 2019 by Amicus.

06 March, 2019 | AtoZ Markets â A British newspaper has published a report on February 28 alleging that it had seen documents. Those were proving that the executives of the digital bank Revolut had deliberately switched off an automated system. It is designed to prevent suspicious transactions for a three-month period in 2018.

The newspaper said thousands of illegal transactions might have been processed through the Revolutâs digital banking system between July and September last year. This reportedly has attracted the attention of the UKâs Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). And it led to the resignation of Peter Higgins, the CFO of Revolut who had worked at JPMorgan for more than 12 years.

REVOLUT CEO Denies Money Laundering Claims

CEO Nik Storonsky has stated that thereâs been some misleading information in the media relating to [the startupâs]compliance function. According to him, Revolut had opted to revert to its previous AML systems after an upgrade failed to produce adequate security.

He continued by saying this action did not result in a breach of sanctions or AML regulations. It meant that the company did not see fit to send a formal notification to the regulator. Storonsky added:

âAt no point during this time did we fail to meet our legal or regulatory requirements. We conducted a thorough review of all transactions that were processed during this time, which confirmed that there were no breaches.â

REVOLUT Money Laundering Investigation

At the moment, the fintech firm is the subject of investigation in the United Kingdom and Lithuania. Police in the UK have launched an official fraud investigation over a complaint on a money transfer by the digital bank. That adds further pressure to the fintech company. It is already facing investigations on other issues from the financial regulators.

The City of London Police confirmed this on the tweet. An investigation, led by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, instigated after the Metropolitan Police received a complaint about the company in early February.

In Lithuania, the digital banking startup received a European banking licence last year. The firm has also come under the microscope over concerns relating to politicians funding. An initial investigation upon application for a licence is common practice. However, Revolut subjected to a second probing, as lawmakers worried about the source of some stakeholdersâ money.

REVOLUTâs Internal Culture Under Fire

Meanwhile, the companyâs internal culture has also come under attack as a report has emerged that further taints the startup. According to Wired, the successful company, valued at $1.7 billion, has come at a huge cost to its staff.

Former employees have described a toxic environment of unpaid work, high staff turnover and no work-life balance. It also claims that the staff compelled to carry out unpaid tasks and given unachievable targets.

The CEO said on the companyâs Slack channel in 2018 that senior staff were not working on weekends to hit targets. And he also affirmed those team members with performance ratings significantly below expectations. That would dismiss without negotiations in a subsequent review.

In a recent Tweet, Storonsky said that the companyâs internal working culture had evolved as fast as our business. He added that it had spent a lot of time working on its culture over the past 18 months.

We've made mistakes in the past, but we are not the same company that we were 18 months ago. We're not perfect, but we definitely want to be. https://t.co/MIyPirrntO

31,"Payment companies are ramping up their processes to combat fraud and scams as regulators warn financial institutions of illicit activities related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Compliance teams at companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc. and Western Union Co. have been closely monitoring early indicators of fraudulent activities and incorporating them into their investigation processes.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a U.S. Treasury Department bureau focusing on combating illicit finance, alerted financial institutions to an increase in Covid-19-related scams in an advisory this week. Among them are fraudulent offerings of cures, bogus vaccines and unauthorized tests, nondelivery scams of medical supplies or protective gear, price gouging and the hoarding of merchandise in high demand during the pandemic, such as hand sanitizers and toilet paper.

âDetecting, preventing and reporting Covid-19-related scams and illicit activity is critical to our national security, safeguarding legitimate relief efforts and protecting innocent people from harm,â FinCEN said in the advisory.

nCEN said it detected the trends through anti-money-laundering data submitted by financial institutions, in public reports such as news announcements, and publications by international organizations and law enforcement agencies.

Other federal agencies, including the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also have spotted these trends, according to the notice.

A focus at PayPal has been to distinguish cybercriminals and scammers from legitimate customers, charities and fundraisers, according to Aaron Karczmer, the digital payment companyâs chief risk officer. When tragedies or natural disasters happen, it tends to bring out the best in people who might be inclined to make donations to organizations or to support local businesses, he said. Scammers exploit scenarios like that.

âWeâre able to set our systems in a way that can identify that incoming, very good type of commerce and enable it,â Mr. Karczmer said. â[Itâs an] opportunity to enable good commerce and the opportunity to stop fraudsters from taking advantage.â

To identify possible swindlers, PayPalâs financial crime team picks up early tips from law enforcement, as well as from internal investigations and merchant reviews. The team then incorporates the information into algorithms that help PayPal identify possible suspicious transactions sent through the companyâs platforms, Mr. Karczmer said. The company also uses a multistep verification process to ensure the payment is going to the right recipient.

Western Union has started to see internet-sale scams and romance scams incorporate the pandemic, according to Tyler Hand, the companyâs chief compliance officer. A possible internet-sale scam might now promote masks or vaccination kits that never existed and will never arrive, he said. A romance scam might involve an impostor striking up an online relationship and asking for payments to buy a coronavirus test to travel and finally meet, only to pocket the cash and disappear.

Western Unionâs antifraud programs already were designed to detect potentially suspicious activity based on where the money is transferred and whether the locations historically are associated with scams, Mr. Hand said. âCovid-19 is no different,â he said.

The company updates its transaction monitoring system based on information from internal and external sources and calls senders who may unwittingly be involved in fraudulent activities based on risk indicators such as a payment amount, according to Mr. Hand. The company learns more about the types of possible scams through those calls and uses the information to enhance its systems.

âItâs really sort of a constant feedback loop,â he said.

32,"A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged 1-to-1 with another âstableâ currency. In most cases, these coins are pegged to the US dollar and, as such, allow for true transfers of actual fiat currencies between parties using the blockchain. If youâre nodding off right now thinking about this, I would posit that these moves, however minor right now, are an important step forward in cryptocurrency acceptance.

The latest stablecoin to hit the virtual streets is the Gemini Dollar. This coin comes on the heels of the much-ridiculed Tether, a stablecoin created in 2014 that has been the the brunt of much criticism including suggestions that the team has been artificially pumping the currency with wash trades.

The new currency by Winklevoss -run Gemini is pegged directly to the US dollar on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that for every Gemini Dollar there is one actual dollar in a bank account. The Gemini Trust Company holds the deposits and has been officially accepted by the New York Department of Financial Services, the regulatory body associated with banking and finance.

The GD, in other words, is the first stablecoin to gain a truly official imprimatur.

âAs the financial technology marketplace continues to evolve, New York is committed to fostering innovation while ensuring responsible growth. These approvals demonstrate that companies can create change and strong standards of compliance within a strong state regulatory framework that safeguards regulated entities and protects consumers,â said Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo.

From the release:

DFS issued a limited purpose trust company charter to Gemini in October 2015 to operate a virtual currency exchange through which it offers customers services for buying, selling, sending, receiving, and storing virtual currency. DFS issued a limited purpose trust company charter in May 2015 to itBit, now Paxos Trust Company, which operates the itBit exchange, to offer services for buying, selling, sending, receiving, and storing virtual currency.

The NYDFS requires that the Gemini dollars âare fully exchangeable for a U.S. dollarâ and that Gemini will maintain records of their movement. The requirements also include controls including AML and OFAC controls to present money laundering or terrorist financing. An independent accountant will examine the fiat-holding bank account to ensure that all of the stable coins are accounted for. You can convert and withdraw Gemini Dollars directly onto the Ethereum blockchain.

34,"Authorities at the state, local and federal levels utilize data provided by financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its related anti-money laundering compliance requirements to aid in their investigations into money laundering, terrorist financing and related financial crimes, among other criminal activity. This data is encapsulated in reports such as suspicious activity reports (SARs) and currency transaction reports (CTRs) which are required under certain regulatory policies.

Government and industry stakeholders have been discussing potential changes to the anti-money laundering regime for years Financial industry groups have proposed raising the dollar threshold that triggers SARs and CTRs to reduce the reporting burden. Current regulatory requirements tend to push financial institutions to focus resources on record keeping for compliance sake while still striving to share BSA reports with substantive investigative data.

Now change is on the horizon and may lead to purposeful compliance that, in turn, leads to more actionable intelligence for law enforcement. A proposed overhaul to BSA/anti-money laundering compliance requirements coupled with a report on how law enforcement agencies utilize report data in their investigations help paint a picture of a new type of compliance, where the emphasis is on providing actionable intelligence gathered through open-source information.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has proposed changes to the BSA intended to improve the effectiveness of anti-money laundering program requirements. The proposal seeks to clarify anti-money laundering program elements, so covered financial institutions can flexibly align their compliance resources with the governmentâs strategic enforcement priorities.

FinCENâs proposal would require financial institutions to implement an âeffective and reasonably designedâ anti-money laundering program, defined as one that:

Assesses and manages risk as informed by a financial institutionâs own risk assessment process, including consideration of anti-money laundering priorities to be issued by FinCEN consistent with the proposed amendments
Provides for compliance with BSA requirements
Provides for the reporting of information with a high degree of usefulness to government authorities

Under the proposed changes, FinCEN would publish a list of âstrategic anti-money laundering prioritiesâ to help guide financial institutions in their shift toward gathering and reporting more useful information to support more thorough investigations and prosecutions.

FinCEN is seeking public comment from stakeholders through November 16, 2020 on the proposed changes through an advance notice of public rulemaking (ANPRM).

What Makes a BSA Report More âUsefulâ to Law Enforcement?

Around the same time FinCEN published their rulemaking notice, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report examining law enforcementâs use of BSA reports to open or expand investigations. The report, drawing from the same ongoing discussions and working groups as the FinCEN proposal, helps shed light on a question many financial institutions are asking in the wake of the proposed regulatory changes: What makes a BSA report useful to law enforcement? It also reveals the challenges that government authorities face as they try to measure the use of BSA reports in their own investigations.

GAO surveyed over 5,000 investigators from six federal agencies (DEA, FBI, HSI, IRS-CI, U.S. Attorneysâ Offices and Secret Service) about their use of BSA reports in investigations. Below are excerpts of the report covering the primary data points.

The survey asked law enforcement personnel about their use of BSA reports to conduct four activities:

starting or assisting new criminal investigations (i.e., the period from developing or following up on a lead or an allegation until opening a case);

2. conducting or assisting ongoing criminal investigations

3. analyzing trends, patterns, or issues associated with criminal activities, separate from ongoing case work; and

4. working on criminal prosecutions occurring after the person has been formally accused of a crime, including for civil or criminal asset forfeitures or for restitution purposes.

We found that law enforcement personnel at the six federal agencies we surveyed reported using BSA reports extensively to inform their activities from 2015 through 2018. Specifically, we estimated that 72 percent of personnel who conducted investigations from 2015 through 2018 used BSA reports in that work. In addition, 59 percent of personnel who started a criminal investigation used BSA reports in those efforts.

Types of Information provided by BSA Reports:

Information to identify new subjects or trends.

We estimated that 93 percent of law enforcement personnel who used BSA reports to start investigations almost always, frequently, or occasionally found relevant reports to identify potential subjects or networks from which a new investigation might be initiated

Information to expand ongoing investigations and prosecution

We estimated that 92 percent of law enforcement personnel who used BSA reports for investigations almost always, frequently, or occasionally found relevant BSA reports to identify additional information about the subject. Additional information provided by a BSA report could include a subjectâs contact information, Internet Protocol address, alternate names and addresses, and occupation or employer, among other things.

Information to help with other aspects of investigations, analysis, and prosecutions.

According to our survey, law enforcement personnel often reported finding relevant BSA reports for other aspects of their investigative, analytical, and prosecutorial work, including the following:

Identifying assets for possible forfeiture or restitution
Confirming known information about a subject
Eliminating an investigation or narrowing the scope

These responses provide a glimpse at what government authorities consider information with a âhigh degree of usefulnessâ that financial institutions would need to report under FinCENâs proposed AML changes. It also highlights the governmentâs need to improve information sharing and access to BSA reports. Improvements to financial institution reporting requirements are only as effective as the governmentâs ability to fully leverage the information across mission sets.

Gathering Useful Information for Anti-Money Laundering Compliance

It is important to note that some of the most useful information included in BSA reports can be found on the open internet. Gathering publicly available information using open-source intelligence (OSINT) is nothing new in the world of anti-money laundering compliance and investigations, but it is likely to become a more critical aspect of an financial institutionâs anti-money laundering program under FinCENâs proposed changes. The new compliance regime may also enable financial institutions to better focus their limited investigative resources on high-priority threats

Financial institutions with investigative teams experienced in OSINT collection will be well positioned to implement a more effective anti-money laundering program and provide more useful information to law enforcement. They may consider allocating compliance resources to better leverage open-source information through investments in both technical capabilities and tradecraft training. Integrating artificial intelligence tools into an OSINT capability stack can improve efficiency and enable investigators to focus on distilling all of the data into a narrative for law enforcement. From social media posts to dark web forums, information is out there, but investigators must know where and how to look.

With open internet investigations comes cyber risks. As financial threat actors become more sophisticated and integrate cyber capabilities into their arsenal to commit crimes or avoid detection, financial institutions need to ensure investigators do not tip off their targets or put their corporate networks at risk.

An Updated Regime to Address a Modern Threat

It is a challenging but worthy endeavor for FinCEN to update the AML regulatory structure in a way that enhances its effectiveness while minimizing additional compliance obligations for covered institutions. Among its many impacts, the proposed changes could lead financial institutions to focus on leveraging open source intelligence that enables faster law enforcement action against high priority threat actors. Improved collaboration between the private sector and government is critical to combating evolving threats. Collaboration is also needed to shape the policy itself, and stakeholders have until November 16 to weigh in with their comments.",nam
35,"Prague based Resistant AI has nabbed a $2.75M seed round. The security startupâs machine learning technology is designed to be deployed on top of AI systems used for financial decision making to protect customers in markets such as financial services and ecommerce from attacks such as targeted manipulation, adversarial machine learning and advanced fraud.

The seed round was co-led by Index Ventures (Jan Hammer) and Credo Ventures (Ondrej Bartos and Vladislav Jez). Seedcamp also participating, along with Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath; Michal Pechoucek, CTO of Avast and other unnamed angel investors. Bartos joins the board of directors on behalf of the investors.

The startup sells an additional layer of protection thatâs specifically designed for tightening security around automated functions such as credit risk scoring and anti-money laundering by using tech to detect fake documents that feed such systems. Its tech is also aimed at uncovering suspicious patterns of transactions which might indicate a strategic attack on the model itself or an attempt to copy sensitive data.

âHistorically, all systems that make high-value financial decisions become targeted. This is already happening with the automated systems deployed by our fintech and financial customers and we are here to protect them,â said Martin Rehak, founder and CEO, in a statement.

The seed round is Resistant AIâs first tranche of external funding, with the founders bootstrapping the company since starting up in February 2019.

âWe have onboarded the first customers in 2019 and the funding will help us scale our sales organisation to meet the rising demand from banks and fintechs,â Rehak told us. âWe are protecting the AI&ML systems used in financial automation from manipulation or misuse by smart attackers.â

Resistant AI has two products it offers its customers at this stage: First, document inspection. It offers a machine learning system thatâs designed to flag and reject âmalicious documentsâ submitted for automated processing. âBank statements, payslips, invoices, purchase orders and KYC documents submitted to fintechs and banks are frequently manipulated or completely falsified,â explained Rehak. âResistant Documents, our first service, identifies and rejects the suspicious or malicious inputs.â

A second offering â Resistant Transactions â applies AI to spot problematic transaction patterns.

âWe work with the fact that most attacks on AI systems require extensive interaction to discover the vulnerability,â he said. âOur system is unique by inspecting all the customer queries (which can take form or payments, money transfers or credit applications assessed by the system we protect) in context of similar queries. By looking at the stream of queries statistically, we can recognise and block the attacks that seek to steal the information embodied in the model (information stealing) or, worse, aim to nudge the system into making the wrong decision by exploiting an existing bias in the system.â

Resistant AI isnât breaking out customer numbers yet but Rehak said it onboarded its first customers last year. âThe funding will help us scale our sales organisation to meet the rising demand from banks and fintechs,â he added, saying also that it will be spending on building out product features and extending functionality, as well as on beefing up the sales and go-to-market team.

âRight now, our target customers are financial and fintech startups, as well as other companies deploying the automated process (both software and RPA) in their financial processes,â he added. âThe financial systems are our current focus, but the attacks on machine learning are relevant in many other areas: process automation, e-commerce, manipulation of âtrend detectionâ algorithms in social media and other opportunities.â

Itâs using a SaaS model â preferring a value approach to pricing, per Rehak. âOur problem and approach is new, and we feel that the value pricing model aligns the incentives between us and the customer in the optimal way,â he said on that.

Asked who he sees as the main competitors for the business, he cited Google Brain plus the tech giantâs activities in adversarial machine learning.

The majority of work in this area is currently done in-house by the large tech companies building their own proprietary systems â such as Google and Microsoft, he added.

Other competitors he mentioned were Inpher, which is enabling machine learning on encrypted data; Sentilink, which is doing detection of synthetic identities in the US; and Bullwall (Denmark) and YC-backed Inscribe (US/Ireland) which are focused on document forgery.

Resistant AIâs founders have a background in machine learning applied to cyber security problems having founded Cognitive Security, an earlier startup which they subsequently sold to Cisco in 2013. Over some 12 years working in the security industry Rehak said they saw how attackers targeting AI systems were getting increasingly sophisticated in avoiding detection â which gave them the idea for their latest business.

Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Jan Hammer, general partner at Index Ventures, added: âAutomation, efficiency and reliability are cornerstones of financial innovation. As machine learning takes more and more nuanced financial decisions, it needs to be protected. And this is not true only in finance, but the attacks will rapidly spread to other domains as well. More of our activity today takes place online, a trend accelerated by COVID-19, and one we believe will last. With criminals ready to take advantage of every vulnerability, the need for solutions such as those from Resistant AI has never been greater.â",nam
36,"An Internet-facing identity management system is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including account take over, fraudulent activities, creation of fraudulent accounts and denial of service attacks. As hackers and fraudsters are getting better and more sophisticated in online transaction attacks, there is a need to detect and remediate fraud in real-time to protect consumers and businesses. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals a new fraud detection ID management system. To a certain degree Apple is already using it context with their iTunes online store. As Apple moves into the ecommerce world with a future iWallet, such a system is going to be a huge benefit to users. So with Apple testing out their new fraud detection system out now, it will ensure that the system is in place once they introduce their iWallet application which, from many accounts, could debut in the next year or two.

Apple Invents Fraud Detection for ID Management Systems

Apple's invention relates to systems, methods and computer program products for identifying and remediating in real-time fraudulent activities associated with identity management systems.

An event (e.g., client request to logon to an account) is received during a time interval. An abnormal pattern in characteristics of one or more attributes of the event is determined. The event is associated with a client identity. One or more reputation scores for the client identity are determined based on event history data associated with the client identity. One or more state objects for one or more client identifier attributes are updated with the reputation scores. One or more remedial actions are implemented against the client request using the one or more updated state objects.

Particular implementations disclosed herein provide one or more of the following advantages. A decision on whether to take remedial action against a client request is improved by determining a reputation of a client identity associated with the client request based on historical event data associated with the client identity. The reputation may be used to detect potential fraudulent activity in real-time or near real-time and to implement an appropriate remedial action against the client request.

Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below is a block diagram of an exemplary fraud detection system for identity management systems.

In some implementations, the fraud detection system (#100 above) may include online service (#102), identity management system (IMS) (#108), centralized account fraud engine or CAFÃ (#110) and client devices. The online service and client devices communicate through a network such as the Internet.

The online service may be any service that requires users to have a user account. Some examples of online services are online stores for purchasing and downloading digital content, such as music, videos, books and software applications.

During operation, the Identity Management System (IMS) receives requests from the client devices (iDevices, Macs, Apple TV) to access an online service. The request may require that the user of the client device provide login information, such as a username and password. This request is also referred to as an ""event."" When the IMS detects a real-time event (e.g., a user login event), the IMS submits a fraud processing request to the fraud engine or CAFE. Based on the results of the fraud processing, the IMS may send a response to client device to accept or deny the request.

The CAFE system is a centralized real-time or near real-time system for identifying and remediating fraudulent events for the IMS. The CAFE system identifies fraudulent network events based on a combination of processes applied to attributes. Some examples of attributes may include but are not limited to: network signatures, device signatures, client account information, remediation history of client identity, event history of the client identity, external intelligence collected on the client identity (e.g., black lists, white lists, scores), request velocity from a client source or any other information that can be used by the CAFÃ system to detect patterns of fraudulent activities.

Some examples of network and device signatures may include but are not limited to: user identifier (ID), device ID, client Internet Protocol (IP) address, device IP address, proxy IP address, user-agent header, timestamp, geo-location, language, requesting services or any other information that may be used by the CAFE system to identify a client identity or event.

The remediation of fraudulent events by the CAFE system may include combinations of the following remedial actions: deny client request, slowdown response time to the client request, enforce additional security protocols on the client request or the attacked resource (e.g., an online account) or any other desired remedial action.

Some of you may have received a notice from Apple like the one noted below, which to a certain degree is one application for this new system of Apple's relating to detecting possible fraud.

37,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued prohibition orders to two former bank employees for fraud and dishonest conduct, it said on Friday (Oct 30).

The orders, issued to Lu Chor Sheng and Tan Swee Thiam Timothy, took effect from Thursday. The cases were unrelated and both have been convicted in the State Courts, MAS added.

Lu and Tan, who received 17 and nine years respectively, are prohibited from performing any regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and from providing any financial advisory service under the Financial Advises Act (FAA).

They are also prohibited from taking part in the management, acting as a director or becoming a substantial shareholder of any capital market services firm under the SFA and any financial advisory firm under the FAA.

Lu, formerly the treasury advisor of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), was sentenced to eight years and four monthsâ jail for abetment of cheating, unauthorised modification of the contents of OCBCâs system and offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.

He had used a friendâs OCBC accounts to âplace unauthorised forward foreign exchange trades with off-market ratesâ in the bankâs system, which allowed him to buy lower and sell higher than prevailing market rates.

âTo realise profits, Mr Lu placed additional unauthorised trades in his customersâ accounts as counterparties to the trades placed in his friendsâ accounts,â MAS said.

He told his customers that these were erroneous trades and would be reversed at no loss to them. Lu also instigated his friend to impersonate his customers to place unauthorised forward foreign exchange orders with OCBC to close off unauthorised foreign exchange trades that he had placed in the customersâ accounts.

When OCBC discovered the unauthorised trades, it closed out the outstanding contracts in Luâs customer accounts, suffering a total loss of S$3.09 million.

Lu made a profit of about S$1.09 million from his misconduct, which he used to buy foreign currencies and repay debts, MAS said.

In the second case, Tan, a former relationship manager of United Overseas Bank (UOB) had misused a friendâs bank account to make unauthorised bank transfers.

The woman, a customer of UOB, had entrusted her bank accounts, Internet banking security token and ATM card to him.

âBetween March 2015 and January 2016, Mr Tan made unauthorised Internet bank transfers amounting to around S$263,500 from this customerâs UOB account to his personal bank account, in order to pay for his living expenses,â MAS said.

For this, he was convicted of criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code and offences under the Computer Misuse Act.",am
38,"PETALING JAYA: More than 50% of financial institutions (FIs) in Malaysia see identity verification (58%) and cyber fraud prevention (50%) as key challenges in driving digital transaction growth, according to GBG, a specialist in fraud, identity verification and location data intelligence.

It was reported that Malaysia experienced RM153 million of losses as a result of cybercrimes in the first five months of 2019.

About 47% of FIs in Malaysia indicated fraud detection while digitally onboarding new customers as the biggest challenge, which is higher than the Asia Pacific (Apac) aggregate of 37%, as revealed in GBGâs inaugural report in Malaysia, âFuture-proofing Fraud Prevention in Digital Channels: Malaysia FI Studyâ.

GBG Apac managing director June Lee (pix) said this was due to the high penetration of mobile utilisation in the country and Covid-19 has increased the number even further as consumers are driven to perform financial transactions now.

The second biggest challenge indicated was identity verification of new customers for account opening (33%).

âThink about how we get through our day. The massive amount of personal data that we leave in the trail, from accessing our social media account, posting a video online, getting on the e-commerce platform to buy groceries, collecting and uploading data to the cloud from wearables like Fitbitâ¦ all these activities make cyberfraud easier to administer. FIs are even more vulnerable to these cyber activities,â she said in a virtual media briefing today.

The ability of Malaysian FIs to manage fraud in the entire digital customer journey is, however, not yet on par with the progressive pace of digitalisation.

âIn most cases, the digitalisation of the product move at a much faster rate than the adoption of technology to protect and defend against cyber fraud. The Covid-19 pandemic also helped to escalate the volume of cyberfraud attacks with our increased online dependency,â added Lee, who is based in Singapore.

This gap will be intensified as over 25% of Malaysian FIs plan to ramp up their rollout of instant banking and credit facilities, particularly instant bank account application, instant loan and instant credit card application. Instant financial services are of huge interest to consumers, providing them immediate gratification in obtaining financial support and merchandise, but fraud detection and prevention for these services are still in the nascent stage and both organisation and consumers could be more vulnerable to unchartered fraud types.

For FIs in Malaysia, digital banking and cashless services have gone mainstream and are pegged to overtake the average Apac rate of adoption this year, in particularly e-banking, e-statements, and e-wallet services. The indicators reflecting Malaysiaâs growing digital lifestyle preference can be seen from their relatively high smartphone penetration at 78%, and the readiness in its internet infrastructure from the 80% penetration rate of their 4G networks.

From the research, all fraud typologies from social engineering, first party fraud, cyber attacks and anti-money laundering are projected to rise in 2020-2021. In particular, 54% of the FIs in Malaysia are expecting an increase in scams and 51% on stolen IDs.

âLooking at 2020-2021, the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to push people and businesses to take digital-first approaches to financial transactions. Our research indicates that 21% of FIs in Malaysia have started to lay the groundwork in establishing end-to-end fraud management platforms. However, the expected growth in scams would require added layers of data intelligence to assess the digital tools which are used to onboard and transact with the financial organisations, as well as to obtain a better holistic view of the intent and integrity of the individuals.

Meanwhile, Lee pointed out that at least 60% of the FIs in Malaysia have approved budget to invest in cyber fraud solutions this year, but noted that only about 20% of FIs are currently equipped.

When comparing Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, Lee said Malaysia has done well and is advanced in terms of having a Risk Management in Technology policy and a fraud bureau that allows banks to share information of fraudsters.

âFraud mitigation is not just about technology, itâs also the people, processes and policies. You can have the best technology, but human can be your weakest link. Banks need to look at all the different areas. All these, coupled with implementing some of the latest technology, can help to mitigate wide-ranging fraud. In addition, we encourage FIs to come together to have a regular sharing session on the trends they see in the market.â

GBG worked with The Asian Banker to conduct the survey across 324 respondents from FIs in six Apac countries, including Malaysia.",nam
39,"After a hijab and face veil ban, Austriaâs right wing government is set to introduce draconian measures against expressions of âpolitical Islam.â

Austriaâs right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has announced a raft of new measures which would make âpolitical Islamâ a criminal offence.

Kurz used Twitter to announce the new policy stating âIn the fight against political Islam, we will create a criminal offense called âpolitical Islamâ in order to be able to take action against those who are not terrorists themselves, but who create the breeding ground for such.â

The announcement caught many by surprise. The draconian measures do not define âpolitical Islamâ nor do they lay out the extent that daily Muslim practices and needs could be now criminalised as a result of this new law.

Kurz went on to add, âThere will be further possibilities for the closure of the places of worship, the introduction of an imams register, the symbol and association law will be tightened and measures will be taken to drain financial flows for terrorist financing.â

In the past, Austria has shut down several mosques which it deemed to be political. The move at the the time was condemned as a âreflection of the Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory waveâ in the country.

Farid Hafez, an Austrian political scientist at the Department of Political Science and Sociology at the University of Salzburg, speaking to TRT World, condemned the latest actions taken by the Kurz government.

âThis is the latest step by the government to crush Muslim civil society and send a message out that no one is safe,â said Hafez.

âMaking âpolitical islamâ a criminal offense would open the doors for every future crackdown,â imperiling all future Muslim activism added Hafez.

Earlier this month, a lone 20-year-old gunman who in the past had attempted to join ISIS (Daesh), attacked several civilians in Vienna. This resulted in four deaths. The attacks were roundly condemned by Muslim groups, and two local Austrian-Turks helped an injured police officer, carrying her to safety.

Kurzâs latest action plan does not indicate in any shape how an attack by a lone individual would have been prevented. Moreover, it threatens to stigmatise wider Muslim society.

One local Austrian journalist attacked the move as a threat to basic freedoms.

âDo we really want to live in a society where experts and the government decide which people are imprisoned for life on sheer suspicion?â he said.

The journalist, Michael Bonvalot, asked whether a law on ""political Christianity"" was planned, adding that the governmentâs current measures are âsimply populist racism.â

Austria, in recent years, has seen increasing far-right activity and Islamophobic incidents. A report looking at Islamophobia in Europe found that there had been a doubling of Islamophobic incidents in 2019, with 1,050 cases of anti-Muslim hate crime.

In consecutive elections in Austria, the fear of Muslims has been often used as a tool to gain more votes by far-right parties, however, according to the Islamophobia report âno political party to date has really positioned itself against those anti-Muslim claims, suggesting that Islamophobia still enjoys a hegemonic power across the political spectrum.â

In 2019, Austriaâs far right government led by Kurz, implemented a hijab ban in primary schools and in 2017, it instituted a controversial ban on face veils. Both moves have been instituted on the grounds of fighting âpolitical Islamâ. Many Muslims will now be left wondering what other normative Muslim practices may fall inside the ill-defined government dragnet of âpolitical Islam.â",nam

42,"Anti-money laundering (AML) laws remain anchored in their 1970s design despite now being used to respond to modern terrorism financing. In the face of persistent threats from terrorism, ignoring innovation can cost lives. Several new technologies could modernize the AML framework to help law enforcement better target terrorism financing and money laundering, making the system faster, more efficient, and safer. This is the second post in our series about the potential for these technologies.

It is well known that technology has revolutionized industries such as music and movies, but its impact is less well known on other sectors such as recordkeeping. As technology advances it often creates avenues to rethink the way we do things. One area ripe for technological innovation is AML. As weâve mentioned before, the current AML framework was designed in the 1970s before the internet revolution. As it currently stands, bank compliance officers search records for patterns and trends that regulators say constitute suspicious activity. Those officers report suspicious transactions to government regulators which then determine which transactions should be investigated by law enforcement.

Two recent examples of the superhuman powers of computers, IBMâs Watson and Googleâs AlphaGo could provide the foundation for revolutionizing AML monitoring. If weâve learned anything since the invention of computers, itâs that they are much better than humans at monotonous tasks like sifting and searching through mountains of data.

Reporting Under the Current AML System

As weâve previously discussed, the number of AML reports skyrocketed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Some commentators, including Juan Zarate, former assistant secretary of the Treasury for terrorist financing and financial crimes, have argued that much of this increase is due to concerns about reputational risk and a federal law that grants banks a safe harbor for reporting rather than the quality of internal monitoring systems. This provides a perverse incentive for financial institutions to file reports regardless of whether they believe a transaction is suspicious or not. That in turn leads to over-reporting and the production of massive amounts of data that could make criminal detection more difficult for law enforcement.

If weâve learned anything since the invention of computers, itâs that they are much better than humans at monotonous tasks like sifting and searching through mountains of data.

The problem with an ever increasing store of data is that someone has to sift through it all. Anyone who has used Ctrl + F to find a word or phrase in a long document knows that computers are much better at sifting through data to find keywords. However, if youâve ever spelled that keyword incorrectly, you know the limits of consumer software. To turn the suspicious activity report database into something useful, we need to leverage new technologies that combine the speed of computers with the insight of humans. Fortunately, tech companies are hard at work making these technologies a reality.

Two Types of AI for AML

Watson: IBMâs Watson is most famous for defeating Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, and for leaving Bob Dylan unimpressed with its singing skills. However, the underlying technology behind Watson could revolutionize industries that require searching for answers hidden within mountains of data, including AML databases. Since the AML legal framework gives financial institutions strong incentives to report if they have only the slightest hint of suspicion, millions of reports are filed every year which the filers know are very unlikely to implicate criminal activity. Once filed, the reports must be analyzed for criminal activity taking up massive amounts of time and resources. There must be a better way.

Enter Watson. To win at Jeopardy!, Watson was given access to a massive database of information including the entire text of Wikipedia. Using a combination of natural language processing and advanced hypothesis checking software, Watson was able to determine the answers to questions even in the deliberately complicated style in which Jeopardy! questions are presented. Watson breaks questions down into components to determine what they mean and how to go about answering them. Once it has an idea, Watson passes it through a hypothesis checking program that weighs the evidence for and against it. If the program returns a sufficiently high probability that the idea is correct Watson selects it as its answer.

Treasury currently maintains a database of AML reports submitted by financial institutions along with records of previous AML investigations. If Watson were provided with enough data from these investigations, it could use the same techniques it used to conquer Jeopardy! to find matching patterns in the data much faster than a human. This extra speed is non-trivial in a world where cutting funds to terrorists could mean saving lives. Itâs also useful in the detection of cyber threats and in fact Watson is already being used in the cybersecurity industry.

AlphaGo: Googleâs AlphaGo could be even more revolutionary. While Watson would rely on previous AML investigations to predict new ones that fit a similar pattern, AlphaGo could adapt itself to changing environments using whatâs called an intuitional algorithm. Intuition suggests plausible ideas for what steps to take next without surveying the universe of possible choices. Broadly speaking, it is similar to why when you lose your keys it never occurs to you to ask NASA for a ride to the international space station to look for them. AlphaGo gained its intuition in the game of Go by playing 3 million games and making tweaks to its intuition programming each time. The program then went on to defeat one of the top Go players in the world earlier this year.

What makes AlphaGo so spectacular is that it shows the possibility of general-purpose AI that is able to adapt itself to changing environments. An AlphaGo-style program could monitor transactions and patterns in the current AML framework to refer potential cases to law enforcement. If a referral led to a successful prosecution, the program could tweak itself accordingly. In light of the recent incidents with self-driving cars, AML monitoring would only be fully automated once it was determined that the program was more effective than human monitoring. If itâs progress toward becoming the world Go champion is any indication, we wouldnât need to wait long.",nam

44,"As U.S. jobless claims swell during the pandemic, authorities are urging financial institutions to watch for schemes involving unemployment insurance payments

U.S. unemployment claims, which have surged during the coronavirus pandemic, are amplifying a compliance risk for financial institutions: unemployment insurance fraud.

The Treasury Departmentâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory Tuesday, alerting banks to red flags that could indicate illicit activity, including emerging schemes exploiting vulnerabilities created by the pandemic. In particular, U.S. authorities and financial institutions have spotted instances of fraud related to unemployment payments, according to FinCEN.

Unemployment insurance is a prime target for fraudsters, given the high volume of people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, according to Raymond Dookhie, a managing director at compliance advisory firm K2 Intelligence LLC.

âThe financial systems that are set up to monitor fraud in this current environment are being overloaded,â he said.

Smaller financial institutions, which often have less sophisticated monitoring systems or fewer resources to investigate suspicious activity, are particularly vulnerable, Mr. Dookhie said.

Pandemic-related unemployment fraud could include the use of fake or stolen identities, misrepresentation of income, false claims of having worked for a legitimate company or, in some cases, for a fictitious one, using falsified employee and wage records, FinCEN said.

Schemes also could involve collusion between employers and employees, in which a worker receives unemployment payments as the employer continues to pay the person a reduced wage under the table, according to FinCEN.

The Treasuryâs financial crime unit encouraged financial institutions to conduct additional investigations when appropriate and highlighted possible indicators of illicit activity, such as customers who receive unemployment insurance payments from a state other than the one where the customer claims to reside or have previously worked.

Other indicators of fraud could include unemployment insurance payments from multiple states within the same disbursement time frame and payments that are quickly sent via wire transfer to foreign accounts, particularly in countries with weak anti-money-laundering controls, FinCEN said.

FinCEN also warned of customers who send unemployment insurance payments to a peer-to-peer application or app, then wire the funds to overseas accounts or deposit checks in accounts held by a suspected front company.

Financial institutions are required to file reports that identify suspicious transactions. Such suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are intended to help federal authorities disrupt the flow of money to terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and other bad actors.

âFinancial institutions are effectively at the front lines against the fight against fraud,â Mr. Dookhie said, adding that the guidance would help banks update monitoring systems as fraudstersâ methods evolve.

âFor any surveillance program to be effective, it needs to be periodically updated to reflect the current environment,â he said. âGiven the pandemic, itâs important for those financial institutions to consider all of the types of fraud schemes that can occur.â",nam
45,"Netacea, a provider of bot management solutions, today announces that ClearScore, the UKâs leading free credit score and credit marketplace, has selected Netaceaâs bot management solution to protect against credential stuffing attacks and account takeovers.

Netaceaâs Intent Analyticsâ¢ engine can quickly and accurately distinguish bots from humans, which allows ClearScore to give genuine users access and stop malicious bots. The partnership sees ClearScore advance its online security from web application firewalls, rate limiting, and similar techniques to a more sophisticated machine learning-based solution that can quickly evolve to protect against the current threat landscape of bots.

ClearScore provides its users with simple access to their credit score and report for free and provides financial product recommendations tailored to their credit report. Its ClearScore Protect product also provides âdark web monitoringâ that can check if passwords and usernames have been stolen and are being traded online. It is exactly this sort of trading that Netacea helps protect ClearScore fromâbots use credentials stolen in data breaches to gain access to accounts elsewhere. These attacks can then be used to commit further fraud or subvert existing accountsâfor example applying for a loan in someone elseâs name.

ClearScore found that keeping ahead of this fraud was proving increasingly difficult using standard techniques. For example, more sophisticated bots can avoid rate limiting measures by keeping just below thresholds, and while traffic from certain countries is more likely to be malicious, limiting IP addresses can keep genuine users out. In the last four weeks, Netacea has reduced traffic to login pages by 14% by mitigating bot traffic. In addition, the internal ClearScore security team, previously required to carry out late night manual blocking of suspicious traffic to minimise threats, is now free to tackle other concerns.

âAt ClearScore, we deal with highly sensitive credit report data every minute of every day. In the wrong hands, this data has the potential to have a negative impact on our usersâ personal finances, so we go to great lengths to ensure their data is safe with us. Though our security systems are extremely robust, itâs critical that we protect against user credentials that have been stolen from elsewhere on the Internet being used for account takeover. As a fast-growing business, itâs critical that we maintain our usersâ trust to continue our growth.

âSolutions such as rate limiting and blacklisting IP addresses are only of limited use and can prevent genuine users from gaining access. Working with Netacea means we can stay one step ahead of criminals even as they change how they operateâand we can focus on giving our users the best possible service.â",nam
46,"Mode, an app for investors to buy, store and manage Bitcoin, has partnered with a leading verification provider to reduce the risk of identity fraud and financial crime.

Onfido âs global identity verification tools will be deployed with Modeâs new mobile application to seamlessly verify and connect UK and European citizens seeking to buy and sell bitcoin.

By using Onfidoâs AI-enabled verification technology during its customersâ onboarding and âKnow Your Customerâ (KYC) process, applicants simply take a photo of their government-issued ID and a selfie. Onfido verifies the ID and matches it to the userâs face.

In addition to identity verification, Mode has worked with Onfido to simplify and automate one of the biggest pain points in fintech â the address verification process. This will reduce the need for Mode customers to navigate complicated onboarding procedures, providing a frictionless user experience.
âCreating a seamless user experience has been critical in the makeup of our mobile application,â said Janis Legler, Head of Product and Partnerships at Mode. âSince inception, Onfido has been a true pioneer in the âRegTechâ field, bringing credibility to the industry as a whole through its best-in-class AI-driven approach.â

âWe are excited to be supporting Modeâs aim to build a truly secure and efficient digital banking app,â said Husayn Kassai, CEO and co-founder at Onfido. âService providers shouldnât have to compromise on user experience or security, and weâre thrilled to be working with Mode, who demand both as they build a next-generation financial ecosystem.â",nam
47,"Despite e-commerce firms Amazon and Walmart and others pouring billions of dollars into India, offline retail still commands more than 95% of all sales in the worldâs second largest internet market.

The giants have acknowledged the strong hold neighborhood stores (mom and pop shops) have in the country, and in recent quarters scrambled for ways to work with them. Mukesh Ambani, Indiaâs richest man, has made the dynamics more interesting in the past year as he works to help these neighborhood stores sell online.

But the market opportunity is still too large, and there are many aspects of the old retail business that could use some tech. Thatâs the bet WareIQ, a Bangalore-headquartered, Y Combinator-backed startup is making. And it has just raised a $1.65 million seed financing round from YC, FundersClub, Pioneer Fund, Soma Capital, Emles Venture Advisors and founders of Flexport.

The one-year-old startup operates a platform to leverage the warehouses across the country. It has built a management system for these warehouses, most of which largely engage in offline business-to-business commerce and have had little to no prior e-commerce exposure.

âWe connect these warehouses across India to our platform and utilize their infrastructure for e-commerce order processing,â said Harsh Vaidya, co-founder and chief executive of WareIQ, in an interview with TechCrunch. The company offers this as a service to retail businesses.

Who are these businesses? Third-party sellers (some of whom sell to Amazon and Flipkart and use WareIQ to speed up their delivery), e-commerce firms, social commerce platforms, as well as neighborhood stores and social media influencers.

Any online store, for instance, can send its products to WareIQ, which has integrations with several popular e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. It works with courier partners to move items from one warehouse to another to offer the fastest delivery, explained Vaidya.

The infrastructure stitched together by WareIQ also enables an online seller to set up their own store and engage with customers directly, thereby saving fees they would have paid to Amazon and other established e-commerce players.

âThe sellers were not able do this on their own before because it required them to talk directly to warehousing companies that maintain their own rigid contracts, and high-security deposits, and they still needed to work with multiple technology providers to complete the tech-stack,â he said. WareIQ also offers these sellers last-mile delivery, cash collection and fraud detection among several other services.

âIn a way, we are building an open-source Amazon fulfilment service, where any seller can send their goods to any of our warehouses and we fulfil their Amazon orders, Myntra orders, Flipkart orders or their own website orders. We also comply with the standard of these individual marketplaces, so our sellers get a Prime tag on Amazon,â he said.

WareIQ is free for anyone to sign up with any charge and it takes a cut by the volume of orders it processes. The startup today works with more than 40 fulfilment centres and plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its network to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, he said. Itâs also hiring for a number of tech roles.",nam

Director, Governance and Peace-building, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, UNDP

9 December is the International Anti-Corruption Day, an opportunity to re-affirm our commitment to fight corruption.

The cost of corruption to society is enormous. In its 2017 report, Global Financial Integrity estimates that illicit financial flows (IFFs) in 2014 alone ranged from US$1.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion. The World Economic Forum estimates that the cost of corruption today equals more than 5 percent of global GDP ($2.6 trillion).

These figures are staggering but even more staggering is what lies behind these financial calculations â a world of dire poverty and inequality that continues to be exacerbated by the distortions in income distribution and public expenditure decisions, which are influenced by corrupt practices.

The Panama and Paradise Papers revealed the magnitude of hidden wealth from all over the world in offshore jurisdictions. According to Oxfam International, tax evasion causes Africa alone to lose $14 billion a year in fiscal revenues. These lost budgetary resources could have paid for healthcare to save the lives of 4 million children and could have employed more teachers to get every African child into school.

Similarly, the 2017 Global Corruption Barometer on the Asia-Pacific region shows that out of 22,000 people surveyed, 38 percent of the poorest said they had to pay a bribe to get access to public services. And data from 42 countries compiled by Transparency International reveal that higher levels of bribe-paying are associated with lower literacy rates among young people.

Hence, money lost to corruption is development denied to those most at risk of being left behind.

But corruption doesnât only divert resources from development, it corrodes public trust in government institutions, undermines the rule of law, impairs the systems of checks and balances, and contributes to violence and insecurity.

Recent studies reveal that corruption and the impunity, injustice and inequality that it breeds, is one of the structural drivers of violent extremism that caused the death of nearly 30,000 people in 2015 alone, and cost nearly $90 billion to the global economy. A 2016 UNDP research points out the link between violent extremism and experiences or perceptions of injustice, corruption and systematic discrimination and political and economic marginalization. The â2015 Peace and Corruptionâ report also provides empirical evidence that beyond a certain threshold, there is a correlation between increasing levels of corruption and growing violence and conflict, measured by political instability, violence, terrorism, organized crime, arms trafficking, and homicide rates.

We should therefore address corruption not only as a crime and an impediment to development, but also as a direct threat to peace and stability.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development makes an explicit link between corruption and peaceful, just and inclusive societies. One of the most important commitments in that agenda is âto leave no-one behindâ, not in the delivery of services, not in decision-making and not in the dispensation of justice. Achieving that ambitious goal will not be possible without tackling corruption in all its forms. That is why this yearâs UNDP-UNODC anti-corruption campaign to commemorate the International Anti-Corruption Day focuses on the theme âUnited against corruption for development, peace and securityâ.",nam
49,"The on-demand economy is booming, enabling consumers to get all sorts of goods or services taken care of through their mobile phones. But all those new businesses looking to hire up contractors to drive passengers around, deliver them groceries, or clean their homes need to get background checks, and Checkr wants to help them out.

Now with new funding, it will be in even better shape to take care of those on-demand businesses. The company has raised $9 million in funding led by Accel Partners, with Rich Wong joining the companyâs board. Other investors include Khosla Ventures, SVAngel, Data Collective, Google Ventures, Bobby Yazdani, Elad Gil, Wesley Chan, Scott Banister, Joshua Schachter, David Spector, Paul Buchheit, Kevin Hale, Qasar Younis, Ilya Sukhar, and Tikhon Bernstam.

Checkr offers a service that simplifies the mostly manual process of requesting background checks and makes it easy to integrate into a companyâs existing onboarding workflow. With its platform businesses could vet new workers through an online form or by integrating its API with their hiring systems.

The company offers a series of background checks, including social security number validation, address history, sex offender searches, and checks against terrorist watch lists and national crime databases. It also provides driver background checks for an additional fee.

Via phone, Wong said Accelâs interest in Checkr was due to the companyâs ability to provide an API in an industry that has been largely unchanged for several decades. In that way, he likened its business to Braintree, which was an Accel portfolio company before being acquired by PayPal.

The rapid expansion of the on-demand economy has resulted in heavy demand for Checkrâs services. With just a headcount of four, the company has signed up more than 50 enterprise clients, which include companies like Homejoy, iCracked, Instacart and Doordash. Wong pointed out that by deploying a modern API, Checkr was able to scale to a size that would have been unheard of if it had to provide manual customer support.

Checkrâs clients are on pace to request 10,000 checks a month, which is up from about 2,000 in July when we last wrote about Checkr. According to co-founder Daniel Yanisse, that growth has been driven in part by the addition of new clients, as well as the expansion of some major existing customers.

Of course, thereâs always the possibility that the âon-demand economyâ is a little blown out of proportion, and a little overfunded. Yanisse says the financing will help protect it if somehow the larger economy slows and people arenât as willing to pay someone else to pick up and do their laundry. In the meantime, itâs trying to get embedded into as many of these new businesses as possible.

Then again, Checkr is also seeing interest outside what youâd think of as âsharing economyâ startups, according to Wong. âCustomers are starting to come out of traditional businesses,â he said.

That could open up a much bigger opportunity for the company: After all, about a third of all U.S. workers are freelancers or temporary workers, and the number of businesses that depend on contractors continues to increase. As those businesses enter new geographies, Checkr can expand with them.",nam
50,"Eight months after suffering a data breach the Bank of Montreal says it is integrating its cybersecurity, fraud, and physical security capabilities into a new financial crimes unit.

The unit will be headed by Larry Zelvin, former managing director and global head of cyber security at U.S.-based financial giant Citigroup Inc. Before that he was director of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and senior director for response at the U.S. National Security Council.

He joins the bank Jan. 14.

The unit, which will work with BMOâs anti-money laundering department, will leverage a fusion center model. According to the Booze Allen Hamilton consulting firm, fusion centres bring together disparate groups within an organization to boost intelligence, enhance response speed, reduce costs, and leverage scarce talent. âAs a result, companies realize faster and more efficient threat awareness and mitigation before, during, and following a cyber breach,â it says.

According to the Globe and Mail, the new financial crimes unit will have a staff of nearly 700.

âGiven a growing reliance on advanced digital technologies, the financial services industry is faced with more sophisticated financial crime activities that often exploit misaligned fraud and cyber security practices,â Darryl White, BMOâs chief executive said in a statement. âIt is critical that we continue to invest, and develop our talent and processes to protect information of our customers, the bank and our partners.â

In May, 2018 the Bank of Montreal and CIBCâs Simplii Financial online bank began investigating apparent breaches of customer information, each apparently involving tens of thousands of customers. At the time BMO issued a statement saying âfraudstersâ had told the bank they had some personal and financial information of âa limited number of customers.â

Steve Tennyson, BMOâs chief technology officer, told the Globe and Mail the bank learned lessons from that breach. Attackers are more sophisticated than ever, he said, including using automated bots.",nam
51,"FIFA said Thursday they plan to reinstate a licence for players' agents, banning anyone who has been convicted of ""corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, sexual abuse or harassment.""

The project started in 2018 and which has major financial implications, should result in a vote by the FIFA Congress and come into force in September 2021.

""We open today the consultation process and before summer, between March and June, the FIFA congress should adopt it. It should be in place as from September 2021,"" said Emilio Garcia, FIFA's Chief Legal and Compliance Officer.

""We have done our homework, prepared our documents. We think that our draft regulations are in line with Swiss law and with European law.""

FIFA, who insist on wanting to ""improve transparency and protect players,"" want to reverse the deregulation of the transfer market completed by the removal in 2015 of the player's agent licence which was at the time being regulated by national bodies.

Faced with the proliferation of intermediaries with varying skill levels, FIFA say potential agents must undergo an initial examination and then annually accrue training ""credits"".

Candidates must have professional insurance and ""never have been convicted of corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, sexual abuse or harassment"".

This plan to regulate players' agents has been on FIFA's 'to-do' list since 2018.

Under the new plans, commission will be capped at six per cent of the total amount of a player's contracted salary or 10 per cent of the transfer amount if the agent is paid by the selling club.

The aim is to avoid arrangements such as the transfer of Paul Pogba from Juventus to Manchester United in 2016, for which his agent Mino Raiola reportedly received 49 million euros from the three parties, according to revelations from Football Leaks.

However, the subject promises to be an explosive issue.

As early as last year, the Football Agents Forum (FAF), chaired by Raiola, had threatened FIFA with a legal challenge over the capping of commission, seeing it as a violation of freedom of competition.

""Sometimes, big numbers can cause the agent to not act in the best interests of their clients,"" said James Kitching, FIFA's director of football regulation.

In addition, FIFA said they intend to limit transactions related to transfers organised through a ""clearing house"".

They also want to limit conflicts of interest by prohibiting ""triple representation"", a practice illustrated by the transfer of Pogba and which allowed the agent to be paid both by the player, the selling club and the buyer's club.",am
52,"Australiaâs finance department outsourced an investigation into allegations that the federal MP Michael Sukkar misused his taxpayer-funded staff to the assistant treasurerâs old law firm.

In August the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age reported allegations of branch stacking and smear campaigns involving taxpayer-funded electorate staff in the offices of the Liberal MPs Sukkar and Kevin Andrews.

That prompted Sukkar and Andrews, who denied the allegations, to refer themselves to the finance department to investigate whether there had been any misuse of their taxpayer-funded budget, a potential breach of parliamentary rules.

The investigation found there was an insufficient basis to reach a finding of serious misuse of money or resources. It was outsourced to the major law firm Ashurst, where Sukkar worked for seven years.

Sukkarâs parliamentary biography says: âPrior to entering the Parliament, Michael Sukkar spent seven years working as a lawyer with the firm, Ashurst Australia (then known as Blake Dawson Waldron) where he was a Senior Associate,â the biography reads. âIn this role, he advised many of Australiaâs most successful individuals and largest corporate groups. Before this role, he worked as a Senior Consultant with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers where he specialised in taxation.â

The department and Ashurst both said steps had been taken to avoid any conflict of interest.

The finance department said the reviewer was completely independent, had no link to Sukkar or his time in the then-Blake Dawson Waldron, and had acted âin accordance with their ethical and professional duties as a legal practitionerâ.

âThe reviewer joined Ashurst in 2018 and has not had any prior contact or dealings on a professional or personal basis with Mr Sukkar outside the context of this review,â a spokesman told Guardian Australia on Friday. âMr Sukkar ceased working for Ashurst (then known as Blake Dawson Waldron) in 2013.â

Ashurst told the Guardian it took its responsibilities seriously and acted in accordance with the âhighest standards of ethics and conduct at all timesâ.

âOur usual processes were followed in relation to identification of conflicts in advance of accepting instructions, and we are confident that there is no bias or conflict of any kind, personal or professional, on the part of the firm or any of the individuals who worked on this matter,â the firm said in a statement, provided via the finance department.

The contract to conduct the work was awarded via a panel arrangement, a form of government procurement that allows departments to handpick a contractor from an existing panel of suppliers.

Firms must compete through open tender to get on procurement panels but can then be quickly picked for work relevant to the panel without further tender processes.

The finance department said the terms and conditions of the panel â known as the legal services panel â and the commonwealth procurement rules both require firms to identify conflicts of interest and disclose them.

âThis was undertaken by Ashurst before they were engaged as an independent reviewer for each Review,â the spokesman said.

Guardian Australia approached Sukkarâs office for comment but did not receive a response.

A spokesman for Sukkar told the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that the ministerâs employment was disclosed publicly on his personal website and on parliamentâs website.

âThe ministerâs employment with Ashurst prior to entering parliament has been publicly listed on the official Parliament House website and his personal website since his election,â he said.",am
53,"New York (CNN Business)""Shark Tank"" judge Barbara Corcoran is ""thrilled"" about getting back nearly $400,000 after it was stolen in an elaborate email scam.

Corcoran said last week that a phishing scam swindled her out of $388,700. The scammer tricked her bookkeeper into wiring the money by using an email address that was similar to her assistant's, requesting a payment for a renovation.

The millionaire investor said in a statement Monday that she had ""already accepted"" that she had lost the money and ""moved on.""

""I really thought it was a goner,"" she said.

In a twist of good fortune, she said that the German-based bank the bookkeeper used to wire the money froze the transfer before it was deposited into the scammer's bank account in China. Corcoran said her bank asked the German bank to freeze the transaction so her team could prove it was a fraud.

55,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has lauded the international anticorruption award bestowed by Malaysia on Novel Baswedan.

""The KPK is grateful for the attention of various parties that continue to support and participate in overseeing the process of the Baswedan Novel assault case,"" acting KPK spokesman Ali Fikri stated on Wednesday.

The International Anti-Corruption Award 2020 from the Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion Fund (PIACCF) was bestowed on Baswedan to honor his commitment, bravery, and sacrifice in fighting corruption in Indonesia.

Baswedan, KPK's senior investigator, who was attacked by acid hurled by two people on April 11, 2017, was viewed as the right person to receive the award, Fikri remarked.

""The police have only been able to arrest two of the perpetrators, while the intellectual actor, who masterminded the attack on the Baswedan Novel is yet unknown,"" he noted.

Baswedan lost vision of his left eye owing to the acid attack carried by the two people, who turned out to be active police officers.

The anti-graft agency is optimistic that fair punishment would be meted out to perpetrators behind the assault on Baswedan.

56,"UNDPâs Global Anti-Corruption Programme has published two new knowledge products on Integrating Transparency, Accountability and Anti-Corruption in COVID-19 Response and Recovery:

The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health, humanitarian or socio-economic crisis; it is also a governance crisis, testing the resilience of governance institutions and systems to support societies and economies to recover from the ramifications of COVID-19. In particular, corruption and its consequences significantly impact COVID-19 response and recovery. This Guidance Note presents UNDPâs offer in supporting countries to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in both response and recovery priorities.

To build forward better, UNDPâs Next Generation of Anti-Corruption programming aims at strengthening the role of oversight and anti-corruption institutions for sustainable development; promoting social accountability and the role of civil society; strengthening business integrity; and harnessing the benefits of technology and innovation to enhance transparency and openness. These will contribute to all five pillars of the UNâs framework on socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the recognition that effective and accountable governance systems and processes are critical for progressive socio-economic change.

Download

As the technical lead for the socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UN system, UNDP and its COs worldwide are working to assess the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economies and communities to develop and implement effective strategies for COVID-19 response and recovery. Although there is recognition that COVID-19 impacts governance systems, processes and institutions, existing socio-economic impact analyses have not specifically assessed the links between them, and in particular, the impact of corruption and a lack of transparency and accountability on COVID-19 response and recovery. These are largely due to two main challenges: a lack of knowledge and guidance on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in socio-economic impact analysis; and a lack of coordination between anti-corruption institutions and the institutions focusing on socio-economic aspects.

This guidance note thus provides a practical methodology, including checklist questions, on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in social and economic needs assessment and response in the context of COVID-19.",nam
57,"A police captain whose federal lawsuit alleging he was retaliated against for uncovering corruption was recently dismissed has taken his case to state Superior Court.

Vineland Police Captain Adam Austino sued in February, claiming he was demoted, denied promotions and targeted with phony allegations after exposing wrongdoing in the department and the local PBA.

That suit was dismissed in September, with a judge finding Austino waited too long to file the complaint and that federal court was not the appropriate forum to address his labor grievances. The judge left open the opportunity for Austino to pursue claims in state court over alleged violations of the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act.

The Superior Court action, filed earlier this month, names the City of Vineland and Mayor Anthony Fanucci as defendants. City officials did not respond to a request seeking comment Monday morning.

Austino says retaliation began after he reported in 2012 that PBA Local 266 executive board members were embezzling funds.

Union president Steven Buglio and treasurer William Newman were charged following an investigation and Buglio pleaded guilty to two charges, while Newman entered pre-trial intervention.

After that, Austino reported in 2015 that then-police chief Timothy Codispoti was allegedly siphoning police funds for use in personal political activities. In response to the federal suit, Codispoti told NJ Advance Media in February that this matter had been investigated and no wrongdoing was found.

For making the claim, Codispoti retaliated against Austino by demoting him to a âless desirable tour of duty in the Internal Affairs Unit,â according to the suit.

While assigned there, Austino uncovered violations by the departmentâs street crimes unit and conducted investigations that led to serious discipline and âeven criminal charges against friends and associates of the defendants.â

Wrongdoing cited in the suit included improper searches, evidence tampering, tampering with informant payment records, falsified racial profiling data, misused city funds and false reports.

Because of his work, Austino says he was falsely accused in 2016 of wiretapping PBA members and that he was ultimately exonerated of any wrongdoing. He faced more âvague and false allegationsâ the following year and was again cleared.

Austino says Fanucci worked with allies in the police department to create new captain positions and a deputy chief post and appointed loyalists to those jobs. Austino says he was passed over for the deputy chief job, even though a committee reviewing applicants had recommended him, and, as a result, lost out on an additional $11,000 in annual pay.

More allegations of wrongdoing against Austino followed in 2018, with the PBA targeting him and others in an attempt at intimidation, according to the suit. âAmong other things, the draft complaint falsely alleged that Plaintiff had committed criminal acts.""

The multiple claims against Austino were acts of retaliation and intimidation that violate the conscientious employee protection law, the captain maintains. He seeks compensatory and punitive damages, along with appointment to the deputy chief position, which is held by Pedro Casiano.

Casiano is currently overseeing the department as acting chief.

Vineland Police Chief Rudy Beu IV is suspended pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing. He sued in March alleging he was defamed and suspended for fighting corruption in the department. Many of his allegations are similar to those raised by Austino.",nam
58,"Cheq, a startup focused on preventing ad fraud and ensuring that ads run in brand-safe environments, has raised $16 million in Series B funding.

When the company raised its $5 million Series A last year, CEO Guy Tytunovich contrasted Cheqâs approach with what he called âfirst generation solutions for ad verificationâ â rather than identifying fraud and other issues after an ad has already run, he said Cheq is more proactive and can block ads from being served in real time.

I caught up with Tytunovich yesterday, and he told me that this approach remains one of Cheqâs strengths.

At the same time, he also acknowledged that ârefunds, rebates and make goodsâ are allowing advertisers to achieve a kind of retroactive prevention. So heâs increasingly focused on Cheqâs accuracy.

Tytunovich suggested that rather than simply relying on keywords (an approach that might suggest that a relatively innocuous article like âLeBron James killed it last nightâ isnât an appropriate place to serve an ad), Cheq is examining 1,200 different factors, âlooking for anomalies or looking where the fraudster did some sloppy work.â

He added, âWe investigate every single impression in JavaScript. We are extremely deterministic to not cause this damage of false positives and false negatives.â

Cheq raises $5M for a proactive, AI-driven approach to safe ad placement

And Tytunovich said that despite the number of companies tackling the issue, fraud is still growing â he pointed to a recent report from Cheq estimating that fraud will cost advertisers $23 billion this year.

âYou need to be smarter every day,â he said. âWeâre definitely seeing in ad fraud, not just different types of sophisticated fraud â as the time goes by we see more and more of that organized crime type of ad fraud. Which is fascinating on the one hand, but also itâs kind of frightening if you really think about it.â

The new funding was led by Battery Ventures (which also led the Series A) and MizMaa Ventures. The latter is an Israeli firm that Tytunovich said already âhelped tremendouslyâ with things like introductions, even before making an investment.

Cheq is also moving into new areas like connected TV and console gaming.

Ultimately, Tytunovich said he wants the company to become the âimmune system of the internetâ â which doesnât just mean detecting ad fraud, but also becoming âa solution to everything that sucks about digital advertising specifically, things like fake news and how advertising relates to that.â",nam
59,"An anti-terrorism law that grants sweeping powers to president Rodrigo Duterteâs government is facing mounting legal challenges, as rights groups warn the legislation signals a new, dark chapter for the Philippines.

The act, which lawyers say uses a vague and overly broad definition of terrorism, permits warrantless arrests and allows authorities to hold individuals for weeks without charge. It is to be implemented later this month, though at least six petitions against the law have already been filed in the supreme court.

The government says the powers will allow it to respond to threats by militants, but rights groups warn the law could be used to lock up peaceful critics, and may even limit access to humanitarian aid. The law passed on Friday.

âParticularly in the context of Covid, where the role of humanitarian organisations has never been more important in terms of under-serviced communities, any action that hampers work of humanitarian organisations is really irresponsible,â said Professor Fionnuala NÃ­ AolÃ¡in, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.

The law criminalises anyone who provides âmaterial supportâ to an activity that is deemed a terrorist act. Though an exemption for humanitarian groups is outlined, NÃ­ AolÃ¡in says this is too limited, and the law could have a chilling effect on agencies delivering aid.

The Philippines has faced a recent increase in coronavirus cases, prompting the government to warn a strict lockdown may be reintroduced. Infections have so far reached 50,359, a fifth of which were confirmed in the past five days. There have been 1,314 confirmed deaths.

Edre Olalia, of the National Union of Peoplesâ Lawyers, who plans to file a petition opposing the law in the supreme court, fears the law will have ramifications not just for media, activists and opposition figures, but also members of the public who express opinions online.

He compared the powers provided under the anti-terror act to âa daily martial lawâ.

âIt is unprecedented to give so much power to executive bodies,â he said. The definitions in the law, he added, are âso expansive and broad that even legitimate activity can be considered terrorismâ.

Under the law, an anti-terrorism council, appointed by the president, will have the power to designate individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. The law also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Duterte, who was urged not to rush to sign the act into law, has rejected concerns about its scope. Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation had nothing to fear, he recently told the public, adding that communists were among the terrorists. The government continues to fight a decades-long communist insurgency, as well as threats from Islamist groups, in the south of the country.

In a televised address on Wednesday, he said: âDo not be afraid if you are not a terrorist.â

NÃ­ AolÃ¡in said the term terrorism was an âinherently suspect categoryâ, however, and that the government was deliberately using the cover of counterterrorism to suppress rights.

Many fear the lawâs sweeping definitions will provide a new tool to silence those who are calling for accountability for abuses committed under Duterteâs leadership, including extrajudicial killings carried out during an anti-drug crackdown launched after his election in 2016.

âThe hand is already on the trigger and the law will provide the impetus to press the trigger,â added Olalia.

Over the past few months alone, action has been taken one of the countryâs most prominent media outlets. In June, executive editor of Rappler, Maria Ressa, a critic of Duterte, was convicted of cyber libel - over a story she did not write, and under a law that did exist at the time the article was published. Meanwhile, the countryâs largest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, which has been repeatedly threatened by the president, has been forced off air. Duterte has denied that either of these cases were politically motivated.

Among those challenging the anti-terror law are Christian Monsod and Felicitas Arroyo, who were part of a commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution. Several more groups are expected to file petitions.

The vast majority of supreme court justices are Duterte appointees. âWe will push back, we will fight back,â said Olalia.",nam
60,"Brussels has redoubled efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing with proposals to give the European Banking Authority (EBA) a powerful new mandate to impose sanctions directly on the banks of member states.

A series of measuresthat would make Europeâs banking supervisor the ultimate arbiter in the most serious cross-border money-laundering cases were announced to coincide with the European commission president Jean-Claude Junckerâs annual state of the union speech on Wednesday.

Europe is under pressure to respond following a series of recent scandals including the collapse of ABLV Bank in Latvia and the freezing of assets at Pilatus Bank in Malta following allegations of sanctions busting by its Iranian owner.

Investigations such as the Panama Papers and the Global Laundromat series, which revealed the movement of $21bn (Â£16bn) in dirty funds from Russia, have underlined how poor supervision by member states and a lack of cross-border cooperation between law enforcement agencies is allowing money to flow from countries with high levels of corruption into Europe.

âAnti-money laundering supervision has failed all too often in the EU,â said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president for financial services policy at the commission. He said enhancing the powers of the EBA would ensure âdifferent supervisors cooperate and exchange information and that anti-money laundering rules are enforced effectively across EU countriesâ.

The proposals, which must be agreed by member states and the European parliament, would be fast tracked by amending existing legislation.

The EBA would be able to order national regulators to investigate breaches and specify remedies such as sanctions. If national regulators failed to act, the commission explained in a memo on Wednesday, the EBA would have the power to step in âto address decisions directlyâ to banks.

The EBAâs head office is in London, but it will relocate to Paris after Britain leaves the EU in March.

The agency would be asked to act as a data hub, collecting information on money-laundering risks and trends and fostering exchange of information between national authorities. It would also facilitate cooperation with non-EU countries in cross-border cases.

The commission wants a new, permanent committee to bring together national anti-money laundering supervisors.

âSeveral recent cases of money laundering in European banks have given rise to concerns that gaps remain in the unionâs supervisory framework,â the commission said in its briefing.

It also highlighted âdelayed supervisory reactions and shortcomings with respect to cooperation and information sharingâ both at domestic level, between prudential and anti-money laundering authorities, and across borders between authorities in different member states or countries outside of Europe.

Members of the European parliament have been calling for the creation of a single cross-border agency to step in when national regulators fail to police their banks.

Concerns about regulatory failings have not been limited to smaller member states. In September, an investigation commissioned by Denmarkâs largest bank found $30bn of Russian and other former Soviet bloc money was pumped through its Estonian branch in a single year.

The MEP Molly Scott Cato, a member of the economic and monetary affairs committee, welcomed the proposals.

âWe need this proposal to be brought into law urgently â and certainly during this parliamentary mandate â to protect the integrity of the European financial system,â she said.",nam

62,"Florida officials recently launched the Highway Heroes campaign, which aims to involve truck drivers in the fight to end human trafficking.

Attorney General Ashley Moody and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) on Oct. 26 launched the campaign, which aims to enlist 500,000 truckers. Human trafficking, which involves the use of force to obtain labor or a commercial sex act, exploits about 25 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking.

The Highway Heroes campaign involves outreach materials, which are mailed to commercial driver license holders, and a new webpage that has resources on how to spot signs of human trafficking and report suspected crimes. Indicators that someone may be a victim include anxious behavior, malnourishment and lack of control over identification documents and money.

âTruck drivers play an important role in our fight to end human trafficking,â said Moody, who serves as chair of the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking. âBy spending so much time on the road, visiting truck stops and communicating with each other regularly, these drivers create a powerful network that can be called upon to spot and report suspected human trafficking.â

According to FLHSMV Executive Director Terry Rhodes, more than 500,000 licensed commercial drivers are licensed in Florida. As part of the program, approximately 500,000 letters will be sent to CDL holders by Oct. 30. The letters explain what human trafficking is and direct the reader to the Highway Heroes website, which contains training resources created by Truckers Against Trafficking.

TAT is a national group that educates members of the trucking industry about combating human trafficking. The Highway Heroes campaign offers every trucker in Florida the opportunity to become a TAT-trained driver.

TAT Deputy Director Kylla Lanier said Florida officialsâ concerted effort to create the Highway Heroes program represents an example she hopes other states will replicate.

As part of our #HighwayHeroes initiative, we launched a new website full of information and resources for truckers to learn how to spot trafficking, gather evidence, report the crime and become a Certified #TruckerAgainstTrafficking. https://t.co/jiYZ2q0rKn pic.twitter.com/eqBls00YMG

â AG Ashley Moody (@AGAshleyMoody) October 26, 2020

âWe are receiving requests for more materials from Floridaâs professional drivers and an outpouring of positive comments about their being a part of the solution to this heinous crime,â Lanier told Transport Topics.

Additionally, Highway Heroes will launch a digital media campaign geared toward CDL holders in Florida with messages about human trafficking. The digital campaign will run through January, which is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.

Some 12,000 miles of highway run through Florida, according to the letter mailed out as part of the campaign. According to the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking, Florida ranks third in the nation in number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.

âTruck drivers serve as the eyes and ears on our roads â ensuring everyone stays safe,â said Florida Trucking Association President Ken Armstrong. âThe members of FTA have made it a priority to train their professional drivers to spot and report human trafficking, with almost 1 million drivers having already received the training nationally. We encourage all Florida commercial truck drivers to become a certified Trucker Against Trafficking.â

Fighting human trafficking has been emphasized at the federal level in recent years. In January, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao challenged industry representatives to commit to practices that help combat human trafficking. Specifically, Chao asked for 100 pledges to combat human trafficking in 100 days, a goal that industry members exceeded.

In 2019, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced a final rule that permanently banned commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been convicted of human trafficking. The rulemaking specifically disqualifies drivers who use a truck to commit a felony involving human trafficking.",nam

This is one of the main reasons why Spain is the only country that advanced two levels, from Little or No enforcement to Moderate enforcement, according to this new report.

However, we must not lose sight of the many issues that must still be addressed in order to fight foreign bribery, including:

Resolution of important legal reforms, including the transposition of various EU Directives like the EU 5th AML Directive or the EU Directive for the Protection of Whistleblowers, which are still pending.

Transparency International Spain, along with other civil society organizations, closely monitors the governmentâs actions in order to guarantee an adequate and full transposition of these issues in Spain.

It is clear that corruption in international business transactions undermines government institutions and economic development: it diverts public resources, rewards the corrupt, and damages international trade and investment.

In a year marked by a global health crisis, these opaque cross-border practices could cost additional lives. It is therefore even more crucial now to promote preventive measures of corruption, reinforce accountability and raise awareness about the risks that corruption and foreign bribery pose for both the public and private sectors, and for society in general.",nam

Australian government will boost the capability of its anti-graft agents, to crack down on corporate corruption and track down graft funds at home and abroad by spending $15 million ($11.6 million), Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Saturday.

Graft has become a politically charged issue in Australia, with both the government and opposition promising to crack down on multinational tax avoidance and impose extra regulations on the banking sector as the country heads toward an early election - expected in July.

Turnbull, in a joint statement with the justice minister and the attorney-general, said the extra money would go to three dedicated anti-bribery teams, comprising a total of 26 forensic accountants, litigators and investigators.

âCorruption is corruption, in any and every form,â Capt Amarinder asserted.
The bitumen scam allegations against Bajwa, then PWD minister, were as serious as those being levelled in the scholarship scam, he said. Capt Amarinder claimed that had he chosen to behave as irresponsibly then, as Bajwa expected him to now, he would have sacked the then minister on the basis of unsubstantiated charges without a fair probe.
Amarinder said he had decided to assign a detailed and thorough investigation into the alleged scholarship scam to the chief secretary as there was clearly a dispute between the minister concerned and the social welfare departmentâs additional chief secretary, whose internal report had become the basis of allegations against the minister.
He pointed out that as per the Punjab Rules of Business, 1992, âcases in which there is difference of opinion between the secretary and the minister in chargeâ shall be submitted to the chief minister through the chief secretary before issuance of orders. Having been a minister himself, Bajwa should have known that this was the only way forward in the the present case, he said and added that he had asked the chief secretary to thoroughly probe the matter before forwarding the case to him for action.
Amarinder also trashed the Aam Aadmi Partyâs so-called ârejectionâ of the chief secretaryâs inquiry into the matter, terming it totally absurd and irrational. âWho are they to accept or reject anything?â he said.

""Islamist terrorism is our common enemy. The fight against these murderers and their instigators is our common fight,"" Merkel said in a statement tweeted by her spokesman.

Germany's Foreign Ministry called the attacks in neighboring Austria ""horrifying and disturbing,"" saying that Germany ""would not give in to hate that is supposed to divide our societies.""

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was one of the first foreign leaders to react on Monday night, said Europe would not bow to terrorists following the shootings.

""We French share the shock and sorrow of the Austrian people following the attack in Vienna,"" Macron tweeted in both French and German.

""After France, it is a friendly nation that has been attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with. We will not give in,"" he said.

68,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinaâs foreign ministry office in Hong Kong and the cityâs security chief on Monday defended proposed national security laws by describing some acts in mass pro-democracy protests last year as terrorism.

Several government departments issued statements in defence of the proposal after the biggest protest in the city since the coronavirus lockdown on Sunday.

The security legislation, some details of which were announced last week, aims to tackle secession, subversion and terrorist activities and could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, one of the worldâs leading financial hubs.

Pro-democracy activists and politicians say the legislation could erode Hong Kongâs freedoms, guaranteed under the âone country, two systemsâ agreement under which former colonial power Britain returned the territory to China in 1997.

At a briefing for diplomats, foreign business chambers and correspondents, Chinaâs Foreign Commissioner in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, said the laws would only target a minority of âtroublemakersâ who had posed âimminent dangerâ to Chinaâs national security.

âThe legislation will alleviate the grave concerns among local and foreign business communities about the violent and terrorist forces,â Xie said.

He declined to clarify specifics of the proposed laws that have stoked concerns, including when the full legislation would be enacted, what specific acts would be outlawed, and whether it would have retroactive effect.

Asked whether the security agencies to be set up in Hong Kong would have law enforcement powers, Xie said: âConcerning the details, they are still being deliberated so Iâm not in a position to tell you right now.â

Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials have come out in recent days seeking to reassure investors their interests would not be harmed and criticisng protesters.

Police Commissioner Chris Tang cited 14 cases involving explosives which he said were commonly used in terrorist attacks overseas, and five seizures of firearms and ammunition since protests began.

Secretary for Security John Lee said âterrorism is growingâ and harmful activities such as calling for Hong Kongâs independence were becoming more rampant.

In scenes evoking memories of last yearâs protests, crowds thronged city streets on Sunday, many chanting âHong Kong independence, the only way out.â

Police said they arrested more than 180 people, firing tear gas and water cannon for the first time in months.

Calls for independence are anathema to Beijing, which considers Hong Kong an inalienable part of the country. The proposed framework stresses Beijingâs intent to crack down on such acts.

Protests are expected to flare again on Wednesday, with the cityâs legislature set to debate a bill to criminalise abuse of Chinaâs national anthem.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote on his blog that the national security law itself does not affect investor confidence, only the âmisunderstandingâ of it does.

The United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and others have expressed concerns about the legislation, widely seen as a potential turning point for Chinaâs freest city.

Washington is considering whether to maintain Hong Kongâs special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a global financial centre.

Several foreign businessmen and diplomats expressed direct concerns towards the proposed law during Xieâs briefing.

In Bejing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the United States of âflagrantly interferingâ in Chinaâs national security legislation.

Taiwan is also considering revoking the special status it extends to Hong Kong due to Chinaâs planned legislation, a move that could make it harder for Hong Kongers to visit and is likely to anger Beijing.

Business figures said the legislation could lead to money and talent leaving the city.

The Hong Kong Bar Association on Monday questioned the legality of a mechanism Beijing is expected to use to introduce the legislation, which annexes it to the cityâs mini-constitution, bypassing public consultation and the legislature.

It also raised doubts about the legality of any new mainland agencies in the city as well as whether the independence of the judicial system will be preserved.

A Hong Kong government spokesperson said most residents and overseas investors âhave nothing to fearâ from the new security legislation.",nam
69,"Global money mover Western Union is commonly a target for fintech companies, but the firm is teaming up with a startup to help increase its presence in the worldâs third-most lucrative remittance market: the Philippines.

Coins, the Manila-based fintech startup that was recently acquired by $10 billion ride-hailing company Go-Jek, said today that it will integrate Western Union, which is valued at $8 billion on the NYSE, into its app to allow Philippines-based users to receive money sent to them from overseas.

The Philippines is a mighty country when it comes to money transfers. There are some 10 million Philippine nationals based overseas and a recent World Bank report ranked the company the worldâs third-most lucrative corridor with an estimated $34 billion sent home from overseas last year. (Thatâs the same as Mexico, with India and China in first and second place, respectively.)

The partnership means Coins users â the company claims five million downloads to date â who receive money via Western Union wonât need to trudge out and wait in line to collect it. Instead, it can be remitted to the Coins app, from where it can be transferred on to other people (peer-to-peer transfers are free) or used on the Coins platform for other payments. Money in the app can be used to pay for utility bills, mobile top-up, public transport trips and at merchants that support its payment service.

One thing the alliance doesnât do, however, is remove Western Union fees, but Coins founder and CEO Ron Hose is optimistic that the deal brings value for both parties and consumers in the Philippines.

âOur mission is working with banks and financial service providers to bring services to people who donât have access,â he told TechCrunch in an interview.

Hose declined to comment on Western Union payments â which are routinely seized upon by startups that look to offer more transparent and cheaper overseas transfers â but, in theory, moving money digitally could pave the way for retail-based remitters, like Western Union, to reduce operational costs and potentially make their service cheaper for consumers in the future.

Western Union already operates its own apps, but, like a number of âold schoolâ global money platforms, its business is inherently a retail one rather than a tech one. Thatâs because it has a strong physical presence â with more than 500,000 location worldwide and some 12,000 in the Philippines alone â which brings with it operational costs, while there is also KYC and other anti-laundering processes that increase expenditure.

It remains to be seen where the Coins-Western Union deal will head. Parent company Go-Jek is busily expanding into Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore while it has a strong base in its native Indonesia, so there could be potential for further alliances in the future.

The Philippines is part of the broad âMiddle East, Africa, and South Asiaâ region in Western Unionâs financial reporting. The company reported flat growth in the region last year, with it accounting for 15 percent of all revenue. It grossed $1.4 billion in sales in the final quarter, but that was down three percent year-on-year. On the positive side, Western Union said its online service grew to 12 percent of consumer sales in the quarter â deals like the Coins partnership are aimed at finding its digital future.",nam
70,"Fraud managers can access SEONâs new Intelligence Tool via downloadable chrome extension or API

SEON, the fraud fighters, has today announced the launch of the latest version of its self-service Intelligence Tool. The solution is an industry first and allows merchants to integrate the tool on their own within minutes, simply by downloading a chrome extension or API. This allows SEON customers to receive help and intelligence immediately before even speaking to a SEON advisor.

The unique and innovative tool gives businesses instant access to rich data taken from the email, phone number or IP addresses they gather from customers, while allowing them to collect all accessible data points about a customerâs digital footprint from social media profiles, available via open sources in the public domain. This is all done in actual real time removing the need for outdated databases.

The collection and use of this information when fighting fraud optimises the payment experience by maximising payment acceptance and minimising declines based on the most up-to-date information. This relieves friction which is time consuming and costly for businesses and can provide a poor experience for customers, all without compromising on security. This is something legacy fraud systems have been trying to tackle unsuccessfully for years,

Whatâs more, its rapid integration time means that it provides day-one value for fraud managers, who have access to real-time decisions and scoring in minutes. They can use the tool 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The new tool can be integrated to work alongside a businessâs existing fraud tools as well as working seamlessly with SEONs award winning fraud prevention platform and has a 7-day free trial, giving fraud managers a level of commercial flexibility previously unseen in the industry.

The new product launch also comes as SEON opens its new commercial HQ in Londonâs Soho, the businessâ second European hub.

SEONâs CEO and Founder, Tamas Kadar, explained from his London HQ: âWe launched SEON because the existing fraud prevention tools are not fit for purpose for the levels of intelligent fraud that we are all facing. In addition, when we created the Intelligence Tool, we wanted to produce a great solution that is loved by its users. It makes life much easier for fraud managers or anyone looking to safeguard transactions, giving them round-the-clock access to a platform which contains all the information needed to fight fraud.â

Set up by digital natives straight out of one of Europeâs leading universities â Corvinus University in Budapest â the company has already experienced rapid growth in the first two-and-a-half years of its life and its platform is being used by over 5,000 merchants. Already, its Intelligence Tool is being used 50 percent of these businesses, including notable merchants such as, KLM, Air France and AVIS.

Bence Jendruszak, COO and Co-Founder at SEON continued: âWhen we entered the fraud prevention industry, we knew we had to do things differently. We didnât want to create a solution that took months to integrate, which included lengthy contracts and different solutions for different sized businesses. Instead, our solution is appropriate for any merchant. It can be downloaded and integrated almost immediately, has a monthly rolling contract that can be picked up and put down when needed, and also has a trial-period allowing fraud professionals to judge the product for themselves. Itâs like Netflix but for protecting businesses.â

Moving forward, SEON will continue to add more and more social networks to its Intelligence Tool, giving businesses even more access to data that helps establish customersâ digital footprints. In addition, it aims to grant even easier access to SEONâs services with its new product-led strategy.",nam

President Trump has been brushing aside advice from some campaign advisers who are privately urging him to prepare for a possible election loss, according to a report.

Instead, the president has remained defiant, with his legal team preparing to mount legal challenges in several battleground states, over claims of fraud in connection with the voting.

While aides have advised the president that lawsuits are unlikely to wipe out Democratic nominee Joe Bidenâs leads in uncalled states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, Trump has seemed uninterested in moving toward a concession, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing several sources speaking on condition of anonymity.

Trump remained behind Biden in the electoral count by early Saturday and appeared to have an increasingly small path to reelection as votes continued to be counted.

The president made allegations with little evicence of widespread fraud this week and said the election was being stolen from him when mail-in ballots counts began to favor Biden.

The campaignâs legal efforts have scored some gains â including an order by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that any Pennsylvania ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward should be segregated and counted separately â but none have succeeded in changing the vote count in the presidentâs favor.

Some of the president's advisers told the Journal they believe a Trump loss is an eventuality.

âThey have a no-stone-unturned strategy,â one adviser said, âbut at some point, you have to wonder when enough is enough.â

Aides are also urging Trump to stay on script and to focus on his final months in office.

One adviser told the Journal the presidentâs mood is âblack,â and he has spent much of his time on the phone telling aides to do everything in their power to avoid an electoral loss.

Publicly, Trumpâs team and many Republicans have supported his claims and called for any election regularities to be investigated.

Earlier this week, the presidentâs son, Donald Trump Jr., accused âvirtually all of the â2024 GOP hopefulsâ"" of a ""lack of action.""

âThey have a perfect platform to show that theyâre willing & able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead,â he tweeted.

Son Eric Trump on Friday alleged that the Democratic National Committe was behind ""spamming"" of the Trump campaign's voter fraud hotline, claiming it was a bid to ""bog down the thousands of complaints we are receiving!""

72,"or BoA (NYSE: BAC), one of the largest US banks in terms of total assets and scope of operations, has noted that the month of October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month.

The BoA, which recently reported that around 97% of its transactions are being processed via digital platforms (a significant number), has said that itâs proud to support the National Cyber Security Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as they work toward helping US residents âstay safer and more secure online.â

The BoA confirms that ensuring security on its platforms remains a top priority for the institution. The bankâs official website points out that the the most common types of online scams are usually carried out by sending fake emails, text messages, voice calls, and letters. In some cases, there might even be someone who can show up at peopleâs homes, unexpectedly.

The BoA notes that there are many different scamming techniques that fraudsters may use. The bank goes on to list some of these techniques (which may have been used before), For instance, the scammer may tell the victim that they should not trust Bank of America, âor to respond to questions in untruthful ways.â In many cases, the fraudsters may also put a lot of pressure on people to send them money.

Scammers can also issue threats that the victim could get in trouble with law enforcement if they donât make a payment (which actually they donât even owe). Online criminals can also put pressure on people or try to convince them to buy fake gift cards and even offer them bogus codes as a form of payment.

(Note: for more details on how scammers are targeting people who use digital financial services, check here.)

Companies across the globe are taking measures to prevent online fraud, which has become one of the most pervasive problems in the digital age.

73,"A little less than two years after raising its seed round, the Israeli-based Nym Health has added another $16.5 million to its cash haul so it can roll out its technology developing auditable machine learning tools for automating hospital billing.

The new financing came from investors, including GV (the investment arm of Google previously known as Google Ventures), and will be used by the company to expand its technology development and sales and marketing efforts across the U.S.

Billing has been a huge problem for healthcare systems in the U.S., thanks to complicated coding that needs to be entered to ensure insurance providers pay for the services medical professionals give to patients.

Nym claims to have solved the problem by developing technologies that can convert medical charts and electronic medical records from physicianâs consultations into proper billing codes automatically. The company uses natural language processing and taxonomies that were specifically developed to understand clinical language to determine the optimal charge for each procedure, examination and diagnostic conducted for a patient, according to Nym.

The company was founded in 2018 by two former members of Israelâs 8200 cybersecurity unit of the army. Adam Rimon and Amihai Neiderman both wanted to work on something together and Neiderman was set on doing something in the medical space involving natural language processing. Rimon had just finished a doctorate in computational linguistics, so the move into charting and medical coding seemed natural.

âBecause of our approach we can generate full audit trails,â said Neiderman. âWe can explain how we understood everything in patient charts.â

Having automated processes that are also auditable is important for healthcare providers in case they need to provide justification to insurance companies for the services they performed.

Nymâs software canât address fraud if physicians are padding their bills with services they didnât offer, but it can provide an audit and justification for the services that a hospital coded for â and potentially wring more money for hospitals that lose out thanks to improperly coded bills. âOn the medical decision-making we never intervene. We assume that the physician is trying to do their best and theyâre sticking to the protocol,â said Neiderman.

Interest in developing better billing systems for healthcare is high among venture investors, considering that coding related denials of payment can cost hospitals $15 billion, according to Nym. Itâs a service that brought attention not just from GV, but Bessemer Venture Partners, Dynamic Loop Capital, Lightspeed, Tiger Global, and angel investors including Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner from Flatiron Health.

âInaccurate coding is bad for everybody,â says Ben Robbins, a venture partner at GV.

Nym charges between $1 and $4 per chart it analyzes, and is already working with around 40 medical providers in the U.S., according to the company.",nam

The present Public Pulse on Corruption, focuses its analysis on perceptions of citizens of Kosovo on the prevalence of corruption, with particular emphasis on Kosovo public institutions on both central and local level.

Data collected through a general population survey with 1300 respondents and 500 targeted interviews with representatives of Kosovo public institutions from all management levels show that 18 percent of interviewed citizens perceive corruption as the most pressing issue. This percentage puts corruption as the second largest problem, trailing only unemployment which is perceived by 39 percent of the respondents as the most pressing issue.

75,"Havana, Oct 6 (Prensa Latina) President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel recalled today the attack against a Cubana de AviaciÃ³n aircraft in mid-flight 44 years ago, which he described as a cowardly and cruel act supported by the United States.

In his Twitter account, the Cuban president affirmed that before this event, known as the Crime of Barbados, which cost the lives of 73 people, Cubans cried indignantly, but also ratified their conviction of sovereignty and did not surrender.

The standing Revolution is the worst punishment for the murderers, DÃ­az-Canel reflected, who placed a link to an article published today by the local newspaper Granma, in which he recalls that the perpetrators of that sabotage died with impunity, awarded, encouraged, and under the protection of the United States.

Cuba commemorates every October 6 the Day of the Victims of State Terrorism, to pay tribute to the more than 3,400 deaths due to the attacks of the United States against the island.

In the last six decades, thousands of acts of sabotage were organized, executed, and financed against the island, as well as economic, military, biological, psychological, diplomatic, media and espionage attacks, attempts to assassinate leaders.

At least 3,478 people died and 2,999 were disabled as a result of Washington's violent plans against the island.

On April 30, the Cuban embassy in Washington was the scene of a new terrorist act, when the citizen of Cuban origin Alexander Alazo fired more than 30 shots at the diplomatic headquarters.

76,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday told citizens not to fear a new anti-terrorism law, addressing for the first time the controversial legislation that has unnerved rights groups over potential violations of civil liberties.

The mercurial leader last week signed the anti-terrorism bill, prompting rights groups to stage protests and lawyers to question the law before the Supreme Court.

âFor the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist,â he said in a televised national address mainly to update Filipinos on the coronavirus outbreak.

Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation have nothing to fear, Duterte said, adding that communists are among the terrorists.

The conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party has raged for half a century and killed more than 40,000 people. In the volatile south, the Philippines faces piracy, kidnappings and extremism by groups influenced by Islamic State, who occupied a southern city in 2017 and are now increasingly carrying out suicide bombings.

The new law creates an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president, which can tag individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. It also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Local and international human rights groups had said that while the Philippines does have clear security threats, the legislation could be abused to target administration opponents and suppress peaceful dissent.",nam

âThe Index shows in detail how the anti-corruption wave that was advancing in Latin America a few years ago has lost steam and, in some places, is dangerously receding. What is even more concerning: this is happening while COVID-19 is increasing the risk of corruption across the region,â said Roberto Simon, Senior Director of Policy at AS/COA.

Rather than measuring perceptions of or the economic damage caused by corruption, the CCC Index evaluates and ranks countries based on how effectively they can combat corruption. Countries with a higher score are deemed more likely to see corrupt actors prosecuted and punished.

The second edition of the CCC Index covers 15 Latin American countries â seven more than in 2019 â and considers 14 key variables, including the independence of judicial institutions, the strength of investigative journalism and the level of resources available for combating white-collar crime. The index relies on extensive data and a proprietary survey conducted among leading anti-corruption experts from Control Risks, academia, civil society, media and the private sector.",nam
78,"Organised crime groups based in the UK reportedly generate more money (over Â£24 million) from selling illegal drugs on the dark web than in any other country in the world.

Knowing this helps us understand how organised crime groups are using the internet to modernise and make money. But it doesnât help us understand what these groups really look like, in terms of their internal organisation, recruitment and general âbusinessâ activity.

In fact, my current research into organised crime in the UK and Europe reveals big gaps in our knowledge. Law enforcement agencies, policymakers and academics have failed to join the dots (or even agree on what those dots are) and achieve a full understanding of organised crime.

Take, for example, the human trafficking network that organised the UK-bound lorry journey that led to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese nationals in 2019. Some arrests have been made, but do we really understand how the groups responsible cooperated to facilitate entry into the UK?

Or consider how the approach to âmodern slaveryâ centres on the condition of the victims (which should not be ignored), but not the organisations which create it.

We know that most of the victims in the UK are minors, often forced to transport and sell drugs on the streets. But who are the people controlling the victims who suffer domestic servitude, forced labour and sexual exploitation? Who operates the brothels and cannabis factories, the car washes and restaurants where modern slavery is put into practice?

Perhaps we need to use another approach â one that is less centred around the moment a crime is committed, and takes a wider view of the membership and organisational structures of the groups behind those crimes.

The Italian way

Some are critical of the Italian law known as âmafia associationâ, which focuses on the criminal network and its membership as being a crime in itself. They believe its implementation risks sending innocent people to prison, while others think the law is specific to the Italian context and its history.

But Italian police officials could easily argue that, to a certain extent, their approach is working. In January 2020, the Italian Guardia Di Finanza in Reggio Calabria arrested, among others, a bank manager and a doctor on suspicion of being members of a mafia association, the âNdrangheta.

They were not the âusual suspectsâ for a mafia. Yet the policeâs joined-up approach of looking at all aspects of human behaviour and criminal activities (monitoring meetings, telephone conversations, financial transactions) locally and nationally was able to reveal the extensive power of the criminal network. This investigation highlights how Italian police have the instruments to be able to see the whole network â in particular the side that is hidden within the legal economy, local politics and society.

Again in January 2020, 94 people were arrested on suspicion of having defrauded EU agricultural subsidies. The suspects varied from traditional foot soldiers of the Sicilian mafia to representatives of the local economy and politics. They included a local mayor and an accountant.

This broad and complex approach allows police officers and judges to work in a practical, concrete and cohesive way by looking at the association of the people as a crime. It is the association that seeks to do the harm.

The focus then moves on to the specific wrong doing as a product of a whole group activity â not just the individuals at the lower levels of the chain who do the âdirty workâ, like selling drugs on the street. Itâs about moving up the chain to intercept the broader supply and importation networks. By looking at the group dynamics, it becomes easier to understand motives and logistics than it is by simply concentrating on standalone crimes.

It is a method which encourages a wider and more informative overview of organised crime. It also acknowledges the intricate nature of how this kind of crime is based both on control of criminal activities and on a âmoney cycleâ.

This is the way organised crime groups seek to simultaneously make money on the streets from illegal activities (drugs, fake goods) and then transfer their profits to the legal economy (businesses, real estate, genuine luxury goods). In other words, following the money becomes central to targeting organised crime groups â and protecting their victims.",nam
79,"The UK governmentâs recent announcement to provide advice helping local councils fight procurement fraud, follows a succession of reports on local government lost income, fraud and corruption. With unique demands â such as the temporary changes to the S114 notice â exacerbated by the stresses resulting from COVID-19 on financial operations in local government, teams are under pressure to reduce operating costs and simultaneously reduce incorrect payments, under more challenging circumstances than ever before. Forensic solutions and services provider FISCAL Technologies says that the key to combating this fraud is in pre-emptively taking a defensive approach to operations.

It was reported that fraud and corruption in local government costs taxpayers up to Â£2.75bn a year, with procurement fraud the largest single area of financial loss. Further, following the lost income resulting from COVID-19, such as in parking income, commercial waste services and rental income, many councils are facing a situation in which they believe their only route is to action a section 114, meaning a freeze on all but essential spending, which especially during this time, could create further problems.

As a result of these worries, the finance function within local government needs to make the accounts payable (AP) department and purchase to pay (P2P) processes as efficient as possible, and most importantly, implement predictive forensics in order to retain and protect cash proactively.

David Thorley, Director of Customer Development at FISCAL Technologies says; âWhile a need to tackle the fraud and corruption in local government has been present for some time, the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has worsened these issues and opened up further vulnerabilities through remote working. Itâs become imperative that councils address these issues and the role of accounts payable (AP) has therefore never been more important. Ultimately, any AP teams that are able to act on data and factual information and have oversight, rather than reacting in hindsight, will be in a strong position to battle these challenges.â

In order to adopt a proactive strategy, finance leaders within local government need a rethink and need to go back to understanding what their risk factors are. David outlines: âRisk factors, such as those posed by the current climate, human errors or poor controls present an opportunity for payment errors, exceptions and fraud, which directly affects the bottom line. With regards to payment exceptions, there is a tendency to either conduct audits or write the amount off, rather than conduct a thorough forensic review of past transactions, due to many incorrectly believing these exceptions to be low risk or value.

âTaking this retrospective approach creates risk. In most cases, because funds have already left the organisation â i.e theyâve paid an invoice twice accidently â these funds will remain lost unless action is taken. Furthermore, tracking and resolving these issues takes time away from more productive activities. Identifying duplicate payments, investigating causes, gathering evidence and recovering lost funds is a lengthy process. This undoubtedly reduces the effectiveness of the finance function, the ability to deliver compliant financial reporting, meet supplier terms of payment and internal targets.

âOrganisations will already have the data required to run this kind of project due to the information that is required for the National Fraud Initiative (NFI). The NFI is an exercise that takes place once every two years that matches electronic data within and between public and private sector bodies to prevent and detect fraud. However, councils submit this data in October but have to wait until February to get the results. Instead, this data can be forensically analysed and reported on instantly, resolving payment exceptions rapidly or before theyâve occurred.â

FISCAL Technologies enables local councils to identify historical payment errors and adverse payment trends with exceptional accuracy and clarity, to uncover lost working capital, through its Forensic Payables Analysis service. Refined over 12 years of working with over 100 local councils, FISCALâs unique service uses payables data from any ERP system to apply an extensive range of AI-powered tests and logic to support financial stability and maintain supply chain relationships.

David adds, â Without strong controls, the risk of financial loss is greatly increased. Continuous, preventative analysis and monitoring of payments â independently from the ERP system â delivers greater control and reduces loss due to error and fraud. Ultimately, in the current climate itâs never been more important to protect cash and uncover lost income. Having the right predictive forensic insights in place enables councils to do this.â",nam

81,"There are smiley people at UK-based data intelligence firm Ripjar with a $36.8 million Series B funding round.

The round was led by Long Ridge Equity Partners and takes Ripjarâs total investment to more than $60 million. Existing investors include Winton Capital and Accenture.

Itâs no secret but Ripjar was founded in 2013 by five former employees of the UKâs Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the town of Cheltenham. A place naÃ¯ve and sentimental at times â and at complete odds with the GCHQâs mission.

Anyway, the company â which is based in Cheltenham â will use the money for new product development and for its data intelligence platform, Labyrinth. It will also expand its sales and marketing team in Asia, North America, and Europe, and recruit more staff. There were no specifics or timelines about all that. Some things are not for your eyes only.

Jeremy Annis, CEO of Ripjar, comments: âThis investment signals enormous confidence in our world-leading data intelligence technology and ability to protect companies and governments from criminal behaviour which threatens their assets and prosperity.â

COVID-19 has not been a spectre as the company says it recently reached the 20,000 user mark and signed six new (unnamed) customers during the lockdown.

Ripjar is out to thwart villains (whether they reside in underground lairs or not) as its technology is designed for institutions and government agencies to address criminal threats, including money laundering, fraud and terrorism.

82,"Ravelin, the London-based company using machine learning to help companies fight fraud when accepting online payments, has raised $20 million in new funding.

The Series C round is led by Draper Esprit, with participation from existing investors Amadeus Capital Partners, BlackFin Tech and Passion Capital. Ravelin disclosed $10 million in Series B funding in September 2018.

Launched in 2016, Ravelin utilises machine learning and graph network technologies to help online businesses reduce losses to fraud and improve acceptance rates of orders. The idea is to do away with cruder, rule-based systems and use machine learning to negate false positives and give merchants more confidence accepting customers/transactions.

With regards to product-market fit, Ravelin says it first found success with large-scale food and cab-ride marketplaces, but has since expanded into travel, ticketing, entertainment, gaming, gambling and retail. In addition to identifying card fraud, Ravelin also works with clients to find compromised accounts (referred to as âaccount takeoverâ), spot incentive abuse and tackle supplier fraud in marketplaces.

Account takeover is where fraudsters use credentials that have been exposed in data breaches to take over an individualâs online account for their own use or to sell on the dark web. âWe have a product that helps secure accounts in the first place, identify at risk accounts and help the merchant reclaim the account for the original user,â explains Ravelinâs chief marketing officer Gerry Carr. âItâs a complex problem and due to the ease that it can be done, a fast growing issue.â

Incentive abuse sees users re-using and/or sharing vouchers and sign-up incentives to defraud a merchant. To prevent this, Ravelin is able to map out the network of users and their associated voucher codes to spot if a voucher is already used by another user and block it.

Supplier fraud typically affects marketplaces where the customer, the courier or the product supplier is working to defraud the marketplace. âThere are many ways this can happen,â says Carr, âa simple example might be a supplier uses a fake account to place an order with cash delivery. In this scenario the marketplace advances the restaurant the payment. Once they receive the payment, the restaurant cancels the order and keeps the payment. We can help a marketplace identify anomalous activity in the network and put a stop to fraudulent behaviour.â

Ravelin is also developing âRavelin Accept,â a product aimed at helping businesses navigate PDS2 and confidently accept rather than reject more transactions. PSD2 means there will be a lot more authentication required for transactions.

âThis risks a lot of failed transactions as consumers struggle with the step-up authentication and merchants are unsure about how to get exemptions to the secure authentication,â explains Carr. âRavelin Accept will have built-in intelligence about how the major issuers like to manage transactions. It will route a transaction to an exemption to authentication where possible, and where it is not, [it] will manage that step-up dynamically to give it the best chance of acceptance. The hard deadline of PSD2 at the end of this year should see significant demand for Ravelin Accept to help with acceptance rates.â

Meanwhile, Ravelin says it will use its Series C round to further invest in these innovations, and to reach more markets and industries globally.

Comments Draper Espritâs Vinoth Jayakumar: âOur model is to invest in innovation over the long term. Ravelin perfectly aligns with that thesis. The team at Ravelin are world-class and continue to work to push the boundaries of their productsâ¦ What got us really excited was the range of problems they solve for clients and the suite of products they are developing.â",nam
83,"MOGADISHU, Somalia - Somaliaâs prime minister on Saturday pledged to form a government that would fight corruption and seeks to restore faith in the rule of law in the long-chaotic Horn of Africa nation.

The PM's statement came during a tour to key financial sources in Mogadishu, including the seaport to discuss the economic situation with the finance minister, central bank governor, and the relevant authorities.

This the first time the new premier announcing his yet-to-be formed governmentâs plan in the fight against graft and mismanagement of the public funds, which is the biggest factor in the economic deterioration.

Last Thursday, the Somali cabinet approves a $671.8 Million national budget for 2021. The world bank has announced 3 days ago that Somaliaâs economy is expected to shrink by 2.5% this year, revising its initial forecast of 3.2% growth due to the impact of the coronavirus, locust, and flood crisis.

Somali security forces arrested the officials in April on charges of embezzling official funds donated to curb the coronavirus pandemic, among others.

The country of more than 10 million people has so far confirmed 3,941 virus cases, including 104 deaths and 3,185 recoveries, according to the ministry of health.

For decades, Somalia ranks among the world's most corrupt countries due to a lack of strong institutions and effective leaders. Insecurity is also a major issue; greatly restricts business and investment.

More than 20 officials, mostly from the Health Ministry were arrested, several bank accounts are frozen while substantial evidence including fake receipts, payment slips, cheques, and fake deals seized.

The term-ending Farmajo-led government has come under increasing pressure recently from the opposition and donors, including the U.S. and EU over the issue of pandemic corruption.

State-building is hampered by large-scale corruption and misappropriation of public funds. There is no developed revenue system as the countryâs institutions are dysfunctional, and there are no integrity mechanisms in place to curb corruption.

In addition, International funding and payments made at sea and airports are the main sources of revenue for the country, but there is no transparency in the collection or distribution of these funds.",nam
84,"One of the measures or tools for verifying integrity of an organization are integrity plans, which represent a documented procedure for assessing the level of vulnerability and exposure to unethical or corrupt practices. All public institutions are required to submit their integrity plans to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CCP) with the primary goal of identifying risks and implementing measures to strengthen integrity.

The Public Procurement Act includes a system for mandatory electronic submission and publication of tenders of a certain value, together with the final decisions and explanations of the contracting authority. These measures are accompanied by the required declarations of assets of those responsible for the public procurement. Since 2016, the STATIST IT solution has been providing information on public procurement awarded in Slovenia from 2013 onwards.

This month the Ministry of Public Administration, in cooperation with the Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (PPA), is starting a project, co-financed by EU funds, that links the PPA payment register and the Public Procurement Portal. The public will have access to data not only on all awarded contracts, but also concrete connections with payments or use of funds on the basis of awarded contracts, which will undoubtedly contribute to the transparency of public procurement and the use of public funds.",nam
85,"TRIPOLI, Libya

The head of Libya's UN-recognized government, Fayez al-Sarraj, said Monday his government has accepted a cease-fire deal with renegade commander Khalifa Haftar to prevent more bloodshed in the country.

""We will not ignore the sacrifices of our sons and martyrs or our dream for a civil state,"" al-Sarraj said in an interview with the private Alahrar TV channel.

""Our acceptance of the cease-fire comes from a position of strength to maintain national and social cohesion,"" he said.

Al-Sarraj said his government forces, however, are ready ""to resume military operations in case of any break to the cease-fire"".

The cease-fire called by Turkey and Russia came into force on Sunday, with the agreement celebrated in Tripoli with fireworks.

In April, Haftar launched an offensive to capture Tripoli from the UN-recognized government.

According to the UN, more than 1,000 people have been killed since the start of the operation and more than 5,000 others injured.

On Sunday, Lev Dengov, the head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement, said al-Sarraj and Haftar may visit Moscow soon in an effort to resolve the Libyan crisis.

Since the ouster of late leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, two seats of power have emerged in Libya: one in eastern Libya supported mainly by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and the other in Tripoli, which enjoys UN and international recognition.

86,"The president on Thursday was asked by DA leader John Steenhuisen to detail the steps taken by law enforcement agencies to fight corruption since May last year.

CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday said there was now a closer working relationship between the state capture commission of inquiry and law enforcement agencies in the fight against corruption.

Ramaphosa was responding to oral questions in the National Assembly. He faced a number of questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) ranging from corruption to racial polarisation in the country.

The president was asked by Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen to detail the steps taken by law enforcement agencies to fight corruption since May last year.

Ramaphosa said the fight against corruption and state capture required amendments to the Zondo commissionâs terms of reference to allow for greater cooperation with law enforcement.

âRecent amendments to the regulations of the state capture commission now allows the commission to share information records and documents directly with the Investigating Directorate and any other law enforcement agency in South Africa,â he said.

Ramaphosa was also asked about corruption accused (ANC) leaders like Ace Magashule.

He said this is an internal ANC matter that was receiving attention.",nam
87,"In late September, Joe Tone, the young editor of the Dallas Observer, broke the news to his staff that they would soon be moving offices. But they wouldnât be going far, just four floors down in their building on the corner of Oak Lawn and Maple. In his pleasant, Midwestern way, he explained that the paper was moving to distance itself from Backpage.com, the classified ad site owned by the Observerâs parent company. That company, Village Voice Media, was based in Phoenix, but Backpage.com, which has been associated with prostitution and underage sex trafficking, was based right here in Dallas, where it ran operations just down the hall from Toneâs office.

In a blog post that went live at 12:14 am on Monday, September 24, he offered more details about the move: âThe longtime owners of the Dallas Observer have sold the paper and its 12 Village Voice Media sister publications to a group of VVM executives, creating a new holding company and cutting ties with Backpage.com, the controversial classified advertising company. So: we have new owners, but the same old bosses.â The new company, based in Denver, is called Voice Media Group.

The âlongtime ownersâ Tone referred to are Mike Lacey and his business partner Jim Larkin, who founded Phoenix New Times in 1970 and grew it into Village Voice Media, the nationâs largest chain of alternative weeklies. (Disclosure: I worked as a staff writer for VVM for three and a half years.) Lacey is a charismatic but prickly man, known for his colorful language, his love of Scotch, and his unwillingness to back down from a fight. He once went to jail as part of a long battle against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

But it seemed the prostitution ads on Backpage.com, which have run in the Observer for years, had generated too much bad press and forced too many national advertisers to sever their ties with VVM. âBackpage.com has been a distraction, thereâs no doubt about it,â Scott Tobias, head of the new Voice Media Group, told the Wall Street Journal. But the site was also too profitable to let go. The âadultâ section of Backpage.com brings in an estimated $22 million a year. It appeared Lacey had decided to get out of the journalism business in favor of the sex business. He cast the move in different terms. In the few interviews he did after the separation announcement, he said his decision to sell the papers but keep Backpage.com was a âFirst Amendment issue.â

Backpage.com started in 2004. Itâs the brainchild of a former Observer classified ad salesman named Carl Ferrer, a shadowy figure who cannot be seen or interviewed by reporters. (Liz McDougall, general counsel for Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC, would confirm nothing about the creator of Backpage.com, even his name, saying itâs for his own safety and âso he can focus on the business.â) The site is a person-to-person marketplace, similar to Craigslist. Backpage.com offers an adult section, with categories such as âescorts,â âbody rubs,â âstrippers & strip clubs,â and âadult jobs.â While plenty of the ads are placed by willing, adult women, the site has also been used by pimps to peddle women, some of them underage.

When Craigslist shut down its adult listings in 2010, after a serial killer used the site to lure victims, Backpage.com thrived, eventually accounting for a reported 70 percent of all prostitution ads in the country. There are now listings for every state in America and for countries on every continent except Antarctica.

The trouble for Backpage.com really began earlier this year, when New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote a series of articles excoriating the site. Kristof, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting on human rights violations in China and genocide in Africa, documented the case of a girl who had been sold as a sex slave on the site when she was 16 years old. Then he pressured VVMâs financiers (including Goldman Sachs) and national advertisers (including Warner Bros., Disney, and Target) to cut ties with the company until Backpage.com agreed to remove the escort ads.

Representatives from VVM tried to make the case that removing the ads would drive the online escort business underground and offshore, making it even more dangerous for the women and children most at risk. But a national campaign sprang up with an online petition that collected 200,000 signatures from people demanding that the ads come down. A website called Village Voice Pimps began documenting dozens of sex trafficking cases nationwide that involved Backpage.com. Activists emailed media outlets across the country with lists of local advertisers that had agreed to stop placing ads in VVM papers.
The company felt the pinch, and by the end of the summer, VVM was laying off writers across its chain of papers.

When the sale of the papers was announced, something strange happened. The management buyout, readers were told, was backed by a private equity fund. But how much money was involved and, more important, who was involvedâthose details were kept private. If VVM was losing ad revenue because of its ownership of Backpage.com, then it stands to reason that part of the value of the fundâs investment in the weekly papers lies in recapturing that money. And the best way to do that would be to make it plain that the new owners are, in fact, new. Shrouding the private equity fund in secrecy only invites speculation. Andrea Powell, the executive director of FAIR Girlsâan organization that helps at-risk girls, including some trafficked on Backpage.comâhas called the sale âa smoke-and-mirrors effortâ on national television. Too, it is rare for media outlets to not reveal their ownership simply because every hard-hitting story would be open to the criticism that it was written to further the interests of a secret, faceless owner.

Before the split, VVM tried to make its case to outside reporters. Now the entire organizationâboth sides of itâhas become tight-lipped. Through their attorney, Lacey and Larkin have declined interviews. Tone said he couldnât comment, instead deferring to a public relations woman in New York; she would only say that all the financials are âa private matter.â Tobias, who is in charge of the Observerâs new ownership group, would only answer questions over email. When asked why his company isnât being transparent about its new sources of income, he replied with a canned statement that read, in part: âThis was a business decision involving two companies who realized they have two separate missionsâone in news and entertainment and one focused exclusively in digital classifiedsâand both are better off focusing on those separate missions.â

Interestingly enough, hours after the split was announced, Village Voice Pimps posted some new information on its site. The group had found the trademark registration for the new Voice Media Group logo. It was registered in Julyâtwo months before the saleâto Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC. That means the logo of the new supposedly independent company is owned by Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.

Thereâs also this: for all the things Lacey is known forâthe drinking, the rabble-rousingâthe 64-year-old multimillionaire is also known for the ink on his hands. Across his knuckles are tattooed the words âHOLD FAST.â",am
88,"Insurtech INSHUR, which raised $7m in February, has today announced four key appointments to help protect its customers from insurance fraud, in a bid to help keep premiums down.

Recent data released by the ABI shows that in 2016 and 2017 there were a total of 238,000 fraudulent claims detected by UK Insurers at a cost of Â£1.3 billion a year. Changes in the law regarding whiplash claims, through to fundamental dishonesty, have given insurers more tools to tackle fraudsters.

For many traditional, non-digital insurers, this remains a perennial problem, pushing up premiums and clogging the court system. Itâs a problem INSHUR aims to reduce with its data-driven technology team.

In order to ensure the insurtech continues to enhance protection for its customers due to fraud, INSHUR has made four key hires; Mike Connolly as Head of Counter Fraud, Peter Truong as Senior Business Intelligence Developer, Milan Chavda as Head of Pricing, and John King as Head of Product.

Co-founder of INSHUR, David Daiches, said: âData and security have always been at the heart of what we do to ensure our customersâ needs and safety is front of mind. In order to offer insurance for commercial drivers in just three minutes, compared to hours or even days, we created a platform that can tap into various data sources to quickly validate a driver, verify their driving history and provide an informed risk profile.

Weâre excited to bring specialist and skilled professionals on board to ensure as we continue to grow we focus on combatting fraud, and therefore keep premiums down for our customers.â

Mike Connolly has 17 yearsâ insurance experience having worked in developing counter fraud strategies and systems at Hastings Direct, Westminster Insurance and Haven Claims.

Mike Connolly, Head of Counter Fraud, said: âIâm happy to join a company that is changing the way insurance is sold and is serious about creating new ways to utilise technology and data to protect its customers from fraud. My aim at INSHUR is to deploy the most cutting edge systems to detect and prevent fraud and see that these processes mirror the seamless experience in purchasing a policy from us.â

Prior to joining INSHUR Peter Truong was a Senior Business Intelligence Consultant working on business intelligence solutions across a range of industries including Banking, Insurance, Legal, Marketing and Public Services.

Talking about his new role, Peter Truong, Senior Business Intelligence Developer, said: âWorking with the team at INSHUR, I intend to consolidate the huge amounts of data the organisation has access to, so we can develop frameworks and processes that will enable consistent and accurate business intelligence to both our partners and clients.â

Milan Chavda has extensive pricing and actuarial experience, working within the insurance industry across multiple underwriting and broker functions having worked at the BGL group, Tesco Underwriting, ERS and Complete Cover Group.

Milan Chavda, Head of Pricing, said: âMy focus is on strategic pricing, including setting adequate rates, optimising prices and reviewing the actuarial performance of the insurance business. I look forward to getting to grips with INSHURâs platform so I can apply advanced analytical techniques to the UK and US portfolios to ensure maximum success for the business.â

With over 13 yearsâ experience in the insurance industry, having formerly worked as Head of Innovation at Beazley, John King brings a wealth of experience from the client side. At Beazley John spent most of his time searching and interviewing insurtech companies to look for ways to innovate the traditional insurance model.

John King, Head of Product, said: âIn my previous roles I have seen a massive disconnect between what the insurance companies were trying to do and what their customers actually needed. INSHUR is different, focusing on their users first and foremost, and then looking at how to make sure they deliver that product in a useful and meaningful way. Itâs a more human way of doing insurance, which immediately attracted me to the company.â",nam
89,"The comments by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin came two days before 14 people are due to go on trial over alleged involvement in attacks in January 2015 including on the Charlie Hebdo weekly that heralded a wave of militant strikes in France.

The threat ""remains extremely high in the country,"" Darmanin said in a speech during a visit to France's internal security service the DGSI.

""The risk of terror of Sunni origin is the main threat that our country is facing,"" he added, promising a fight ""without let-up"".

He said 8,132 individuals had been registered on France's database of suspected Islamist radicals considered to be a potential security threat.

Fourteen alleged accomplices in the January 7-9, 2015 jihadist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly, a French policewoman and a Jewish supermarket go on trial in Paris on Wednesday.

All of the perpetrators were killed in the aftermath of the assaults but lawyers for the victims and prosecutors insist the trial will be a hugely important if potentially traumatic moment.

Speaking on France Info radio Monday, national anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard dismissed the idea that it was just ""little helpers"" going on trial.

""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons, a residence.

""We say at least because as the investigations around some ongoing processes and their likely protagonists are taking place, new things are being discovered"", said the statesman, during the message on the State of the Nation.

According to JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o, it is likely that later, much larger numbers will be announced, which in itself already exceeds the value of Angola's debt to its main creditor.

Government data indicate that, in the context of the asset recovery process, the State has already recovered real estate and money worth more than USD 4.9 billion, of which more than USD 2.7 billion in cash.

The other part, estimated at more than USD 2.1 billion, results from the seizure of real estate, factories, port terminals, office buildings, housing buildings, radio and television stations, graphic units, commercial establishments and others.

The fight against corruption and impunity is one of the banners of President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o's governance.

However, it is part of the government's measures to ensure the creation of a more favourable environment for private investment.

This fight is being conducted by the judicial authorities, based on the Law on Coercive Repatriation and Extended Loss of Property, approved by Parliament, which has allowed the seizure of several assets built with public funds.

Currently, the State has been preparing the process of selling the assets to private entities.

The European Parliament has urged EU governments to impose sanctions on 32 Russian officials over the death of a lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.

The parliament's resolution calls for visa bans and asset freezes - measures that the US has already imposed.

Magnitsky died in prison in 2009 after accusing officials of tax fraud.

A Moscow court convicted Magnitsky himself of embezzlement posthumously - a trial seen in the West as a gross miscarriage of justice.

There is evidence that he suffered torture and neglect in prison. The US blacklist, in force since 2012, drew strong condemnation from Russia.

Acting on behalf of London-based Hermitage Capital Management, Magnitsky had exposed an alleged fraud in which government officials stole $230m (Â£138m; 169m euros) of tax revenue.

But instead of prosecuting any of the alleged embezzlers, the police arrested Magnitsky.

Frosty relations

The MEPs' resolution comes amid heightened tensions between the EU and Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The EU and US have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on senior Russian officials considered to be linked to the annexation.

Various politicians in Europe have urged their governments to adopt a US-style Magnitsky list. Last year the Irish parliament dropped plans for such a blacklist after Russia warned that it might stop adoptions by Irish parents in retaliation.

Many of the names on the proposed European Magnitsky list are also among the 18 named in the US list, including interior ministry investigators Pavel Karpov and Oleg Silchenko, and judge Yelena Stashina.

The European Parliament said the arrest and death in custody of Magnitsky represented a ""well-documented and significant case of disrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia"", which had ""cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of its judicial institutions, and serve as a reminder of the many documented shortcomings in respect for the rule of law in Russia"".",nam

OneConnect Financial Technology Co Ltd, the fintech arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd, is coasting on the Belt and Road Initiative to expand its overseas layout. In doing so, it is meeting the financing needs of local companies in the markets it operates in.

Currently, OneConnect's overseas business spans 15 countries and regions, including Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and Germany. It is constantly expanding into BRI-related economies.

Jessica Tan, Ping An Group's co-CEO, said: ""The reason why our fintech was able to cover more than a dozen countries and regions in 18 months is that we don't compete for customers with local enterprises. Instead, we export fintech. We have over 10 years of experience in fintech. We would like to help local enterprises increase their efficiency and lower costs.""

As an active enabler of the BRI, OneConnect serves local companies across East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe. It endeavors to support key areas related to the initiative, including facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, and financial integration, Tan said.

In July, OneConnect signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Global Market in the United Arab Emirates to develop technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and distributed ledger. In June, it tied up with UBX, a subsidiary of Union Bank in the Philippines, to build the country's first blockchain-enabled technology platform.

The technology platform offers services, including AI analysis, remote review, and anti-fraud scrutiny, to meet local enterprises' digital-age needs like multi-channel loan application processing, credit evaluation, loan appropriation and customer identity verification.

In addition, it can effectively reduce credit approval time, and provide more accurate risk assessment, OneConnect executives said.

Bin Ru Tan, chief executive officer of OneConnect Southeast Asia, said: ""Banks and insurance companies recognize that digital adoption is here to stay and now is an opportune time to accelerate digitalization. We are seeing strong demand for our smart interview, digital banking, and smart lending solutions as they support a truly seamless remote banking experience.

""Having grown our footprint across Southeast Asia, today we have amassed extensive domain knowledge when it comes to understanding the local financial landscape and regulations. We have successfully collaborated with top financial institutions and leading third-party service providers to build end-to-end digital solutions and ecosystems that are highly relevant to the local markets.""

Wang Penghu, general manager of the company finance department of China Citic Bank, said that banks' digital transformation makes inclusive finance possible. Digitalization also contributes to precise marketing, and lowers the banks' customer acquisition service costs, he said.

A report from accounting firm EY(previously Ernst & Young) showed that 85 percent of the banks around the world have made digital transformation the focus of their future work.

Unsurprisingly, OneConnect has been very busy. It has been helping financial institutions in making the required digital transformation. In China, the company has served all of the country's major banks in less than four years. And 99 percent of the country's city commercial banks, and 52 percent of insurance companies, have been empowered with digital transformation. Outside China, OneConnect is making similar inroads into the global financial services industry.

""OneConnect is able to make contributions to the advancement of the financial services industry in Asia, and even the world. We are confident that we can make even more significant contributions, going forward,"" Bin Ru Tan said.

OneConnect's overseas expansion began in Southeast Asia. The region is home to a rapidly rising middle-income class as well as an evergrowing number of internet users. But, modern financial infrastructure is conspicuous by its absence.

For instance, bank card and bank account penetration rates in the region are low. Only a few people of the overall population use credit cards. The credit reporting system is weak. Many people still rely on cash.

OneConnect hopes to introduce Chinese experience and fintech expertise to the region, to quickly bridge the financial services gap and increase the penetration rate of inclusive finance.

Currently, in Thailand, three of the top 10 banks are served by One-Connect, while in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines, OneConnect has made inroads into the local markets by establishing subsidiaries or is working with local enterprises.

""Using our smart finance platform, we included over 70 percent of the small and micro enterprises in the supply chain credit system, greatly increasing their financing possibilities. The fintech solution, which has already proved effective in China, unlocks the vitality of small and micro enterprises in Southeast Asia and boosts the economic development of the countries in the region,"" Bin Ru Tan said.

""We will ramp up our efforts so that the countries can achieve the same good results as in China.""

In the future, more fintech projects will be undertaken in countries and regions related to the BRI, so that the dividends of Chinese technology can benefit a wider range of communities and peoples, company executives said.",nam

Announcing the award, program national director Dr. Elizabeth PeÃ±a Turruellas stated that 32 years after Raul proposed generalizing the tradition of growing vegetables in family gardens, in soil enriched organically, we can say that the first part of this task has been completed.

Dr. PeÃ±a, also a member of the Council of State, added that the program has become a strong popular movement, ready to do much more to increase municipal food supplies and develop local self-sufficiency, in an effort that has always benefitted from RaÃºlâs accurate strategic direction.

With the participation of Lazaro ExpÃ³sito Canto and Beatriz Johnson Urrutia, the provinceâs top Party and government authorities, respectively, as well as Minister of Agriculture Gustavo Rodriguez Rollero and leading producers from across the country, Dr. PeÃ±a presented a report on last yearâs accomplishments and new goals.

She stated that the 21 sub-programs (five for targeted crops, five for animal husbandry and 11 for support), involve some 800,000 people around the country, 31% are women, while in the basic program focused on vegetables and fresh seasonings, 1,277,517 tons of food were grown in organic, intensive cultivation gardens, greenhouses, and plots with technical support.

Animal husbandry in backyards and small plots produced 100,600 tons of meat from small livestock (pigs, sheep, goats, poultry, and rabbits), as well as more than 300 million eggs and 750,000 liters of goat's milk, in addition to fish produced in ponds, reservoirs and other reservoirs.

Given its consistent efforts over the last year, Segundo Frente was declared the countryâs most outstanding municipality, in recognition of results that have earned the movement here recognition as a National Reference for 16 consecutive years, while Santiago de Cuba was honored as the number one province, followed by Havana, Sancti SpÃ­ritus and Pinar del RÃ­o.

Dr. PeÃ±a reported that the suburban program now includes 147,563 farms, and that last year 34,000 individuals were trained in different programs, with a similar number expected to participate in classes this year.

96,"After years of tiptoeing around the issue, EU governments are finally set to check on each otherâs records on the rule of law. This is a significant step forward, but governments have to take this broad dialogue seriously and talks must lead to action, argues Linda Ravo.

Linda Ravo is an expert adviser at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties).

As it reaches the end of its six-month Council Presidency term, Germany has invited all EU governments to sit around the table on 10 November and start a discussion on the rule of law and democracy in every EU country. Discussions will be based on the recently launched annual audit of EU countriesâ rule of law situation by the European Commission.

To avoid this becoming a dialogue for the deaf, the Germans must prepare well and set some clear rules. And the EU still needs to create and use other tools to the full.

A welcome, long over-due step

The fact that this is happening at all is a significant step forward. In the ârule of law dialogueâ that ran for the past six years, governments were just invited (not obliged) to present on a particular aspect of the rule of law in their country. There were no questions, no reviews of a countryâs performance and no recommendations.

In the background, the situation alarmingly deteriorated in Hungary, Poland and a number of other EU countries. It will come as no surprise that the elephants in the room strenuously tried to block any improvements to the old system.

Getting it right

Getting the peer review right could pre-empt, or at least weaken, such attempts. Here are three golden rules.

First, there should be a first discussion involving national independent actors, and regional and international monitoring bodies, before the official dialogue starts. If member states have all the relevant information beforehand, that will help governments backing up the exercise not to fall for the examineesâ deflections and the authoritariansâ provocations.

This will also serve to steal a march on dodgy initiatives to come up with alternative country assessments.

Second, governments should take the dialogue seriously as an opportunity to question their peers on their performance and make tangible recommendations for improvements. We have seen how emulation can gang up authoritarian plans â just think of Slovenian Prime Minister Janez JanÅ¡aâs war against the media, patterning after Hungary and Polandâs.

But peer pressure can be for the best, too.

Third, recommendations should be made public. Governments should have to report back on them and progress should be verified against information from civil society groups and independent monitoring bodies, like the Council of Europe.

A tough row to hoe

Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark and Estonia are first up in the discussion. One can expect Hungary, Poland and its faithful peers to jump on opportunity to attack Belgium and Denmark â two proponents of better protection for the rule of law â and to pick an argument on the others to deepen the blocâs division.

Bulgaria will prove to be an especially difficult discussion. The picture painted of the country in the Commissionâs report is grim. It exposes attacks on the judiciary, an ineffective anti-corruption framework, lack of media pluralism and threats to watchdogs such as journalists and rights groups, coupled with a generally low trust of people in public institutions.

If this is not serious enough, the Commissionâs assessment fails to mention other problematic developments affecting the justice system, as also reported by Liberties. Neither does it dig into how the countryâs oligarchic mafia has been infiltrating the government, which is at the origin of the countryâs pervasive corruption (and misuse of EU taxpayersâ money).

And yet, the Commission considered Bulgaria to have made âsufficientâ progress just a year ago when it looked at what had been accomplished since accession to the EU. This makes the peer review on Bulgaria a real battleground for countries like Hungary who try to undermine the credibility and impartiality of the whole exercise.

Actions speak louder than words

Even if this system of peer review is made as strong as possible, by itself it wonât be enough to preserve European democracies from the kinds of sustained attacks carried out by the EUâs authoritarian governments.

There is no excuse for the Council to continue dragging its feet on imposing sanctions under Article 7 on Hungary and Poland. Governments supportive of democracy also need to stand their ground and push for the adoption of a strong mechanism that will link access to EU funds to respect for the rule of law, instead of getting away with lousy deals.

98,"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made efforts to facilitate equal development of all sections of society. He also worked to strengthen the administrative system and the police. People of the State also need to unite and fight against corruption.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said this while speaking at the ceremonial parade held on the occasion of National Unity Day at the police lines here on Saturday.

On the occasion, the chief minister also presented a trophy and cheque for Rs 1 lakh to the Pokhri police station for being selected as the Stateâs best police station. He also awarded various medals to personnel of the police for commendable work in the spheres of fire fighting, investigation and others.

Speaking on the occasion, the CM said Patel struggled for long for the nationâs independence. After independence, with his strong will power he was able to unite and merge the princely states with the nation.

Unity is vital for the strength of any nation, state and force. The strength of society also increases with unity, said Rawat. He said with the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Patelâs vision of âEk Bharat Shreshth Bharatâ is being achieved. The fight which the nation fought against Covid under the PMâs leadership has become an example for the world.

Today, the nation has succeeded to a considerable extent in tackling the Covid pandemic. Every section of society cooperated fully for protection from Covid. However, till Covid is brought fully under control, all need to maintain full alertness. The CM further stressed on the need for uniting in the fight against corruption.

Mafia elements are trying to make inroads in the state whether it be through their illegal activities focused on drugs, mining or forests. The people need to unite and fight against such elements. The State Government is committed to rid the state of the mafia and Patelâs life will provide inspiration and strength in this endeavour, added the CM.

100,"Tokyo [ Japan ], November 12 (ANI): Amid growing criticism against China for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Japan is mulling a legal foundation for sanctions, similar to those imposed by the US and Europe.
The Japan ese government has asked the local companies that operate in China whether functioning in Xinjiang province could get them into trouble, Nikkei Asia reported.
This comes after several Japan ese companies were reported to be among the 82 global brands named in March by the Australian Global Policy Institute as those linked to factories that use Uyghurs labourers.
The report said that over 80,000 Uyghur workers were transferred out of the Xinjiang province to around 30 factories across the country.
Last week, the US government had removed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement from its list of terrorist organisations after nearly two decades, weakening China 's anti-terror pretext for the draconian crackdown on Uyghurs in its Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the group had been removed from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to an order issued on October 20 made public this month.
This follows the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act by the US in June, which led the administration to impose financial sanctions and visa bans under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese government officials, responsible for the persecution of Uyghur and other Muslims.
The law requires federal government agencies to report on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and attempts by the Chinese government agents to harass Uyghurs and Chinese nationals in the United States.
On similar lines, Japan is thinking of getting new legislation. "" Japan is too slow to act compared to the US and Europe,"" a government official was quoted by Nikkei Asia.
The Japan ese publication said that the country's current legal framework does not easily allow for economic sanctions based on human rights concerns alone, adding that it can freeze assets of foreign players or ban them from entering the country, but only under specific circumstances.
"" Japan must create its own version of the Magnitsky Act that allows comprehensive sanctions in response to human rights issues, and update all other relevant legislation like the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act,"" said Akira Igata, a national security expert. (ANI)",nam
101,"Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente admitted on Tuesday that the passing of the new immigration law could just be the last remaining solution to resolve nagging corruption problem festering the agency.

In a news statement issued on Tuesday morning, Morente said the current Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 is no longer responsive to the concerns and needs of the Bureau of Immigration.

Morente earlier lamented of not having disciplinary powers over BI personnel, as âthe power to hire and fireâ rests with the Secretary of Justice.

âI have talked to the President and raised this concern to him as well. The Philippine Immigration Act is a very old law, 80 years old to be exact. It was enacted during a time when there were no international flights yet entering and leaving the country,â Morente pointed out.

âMany of its provisions are already outdated and inappropriate already,â he added.

The enactment by Congress of the Philippine Immigration Act, according to Morente, will be the long-term solution to the corruption problem in the bureau.

He said the passage of the said law is part of the three-tier approach that the BI has framed to solve corruption and other irregularities in the bureau.

For short-term solution, the BI has implemented a one-strike policy against BI personnel who are subjects of meritorious complaints, or issues, pending the filing of appropriate administrative charges.

âThe short-term solution is to relieve all those found to have been involved in corrupt practices, hence, we relieved all names implicated in the âPastillasâ issue, and implemented a one-strike policy for anyone who tries to follow suit,â he stated.

The medium-term solution, on the other hand, is the continuous reorganization of the system.

âTo add layers of checks and balances, we have transferred the supervision of the Travel Control and Intelligence Unit and the Border Control and Intelligence unit under a different division. This will serve as a sort of audit to the actions of those in the Port Operations Division, and dismantles any semblance of a central control of possible illegal activities. It adds more eyes watching and auditing the activities of airport personnel,â he added.

Morente said both the short term and medium term remedies are now being implemented.

However, the BI chief expressed belief that the real and long-term solution against corruption is the updating of the Philippine Immigration Act.

âWe can remove people again and again, but the loopholes in the law remain. Quick wins may cure some symptoms in the anti- corruption drive but a responsive new immigration law may yet cure systemic problems that breed corruption,â Morente explained.

The new law which is now being prioritized by Congress is expected to address salary woes, remove systemic issues, plug loopholes in policies, update fines and penalties, ensure division of power, and confer to the Commissioner the proper disciplinary powers.

It would also likely lead to the increase in fines to be imposed against airlines who will be caught bringing in improperly documented aliens.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said at a news briefing on Tuesday that the government is now eyeing the âmodernizationâ of the BI to mitigate corrupt practices in the said agency.

Roque said Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra appealed to Congress to finally pass the bill amending the already outdated Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, which created Commission on Immigration and Deportation (CID), which was later renamed to BI.

âSecretary [Guevarra] proposed the passage of the law updating and modernizing the law creating CID since it a Commonwealth Act,â Roque said.

This was confirmed by Guevarra to BusinessMirror in an SMS.

âThe bills for the modernization of BI is already in the committee level in both house chambers so it needs more push [to be passed into law],â Guevarra said. With Samuel P. Medenilla",nam
102,"Founded in 2008 after more than a decade of research at Stanford, Silicon Valley-based startup, Ayasdi, is on a mission to reinvent the methods by which we transform Big Data into actionable knowledge. Essentially, Ayasdi aims to automate the insight discovery process, allowing end users to find valuable intelligence within massive datasets almost instantaneously. Backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation, the startupâs novel synthesis of machine learning and data analysis technologies has not gone unnoticed by investors.

Today, the startup announced that it has raised $10 million in series A financing, led by Khosla Ventures and Floodgate. The new round brings the startupâs total funding to $13.25 million, which includes contributions both from its current investors as well as angel investors like Michael Ovitz, Steve Blank and The Data Collectiveâs Matt Ocko, to name a few.

The investment comes at a time when venture capital is beginning to shift from consumer businesses to the enterprise, as investors look to capitalize on the rise of the big data app and the growing demand for a new data infrastructure.

In fact, Research firm IDC recently predicted that the Big Data market is poised for exponential growth over the next few years, with total revenue projected to reach $24 billion by 2016. Whatâs more, following Derrick Harrisâ logic, if one includes analytics software (arguably an essential segment of the Big Data market) in that definition, then the total is actually upwards of $75 billion.

Yet, in spite of this enormous new market opportunity, the emergence of Big Data doesnât necessarily directly translate into a net positive for business, humankind, etc. In other words, people tend to conflate information and data, such that we end up believing that more data inherently means (proportionately) more information, which in turn means (proportionately) more intelligence, insight and value. However, as Dr. Michael Wu points out, itâs quite literally the opposite: âThe more data you have, the less information you gain as a proportion of the data.â

The true value of Big Data is derived from the insights hidden within, yet, while all insights are information, not all information produces insight. Big Data is composed of enormous amounts of unstructured data, a wide array of data types and media, but the amount of insight that can be extracted from that data is proportionately tiny.

Big Data continues to grow, yet, while governments, businesses and scientists have spent years (and millions of dollars) attempting to address the worldâs biggest problems by analyzing Big Data, progress has been incremental. Although Big Data tools have improved over time, Ayasdi is of the mindset that they are still failing to yield the kind of breakthrough insights that lead to true innovation.

The Ayasdi co-founders attribute this to the prevailing reliance among data scientists on old models â finding insights by asking questions and writing queries. The problem with this is that queries are inherently based on human assumptions and biases, and, in turn, query results tend to only reveal slices of data, rather than providing visibility into the relationships between similar groups of data. This method of discovering insight in Big Data tends to rely heavily on iterative guesswork and chance, and thus takes time to produce real results.

To address this problem, Ayasdi is today officially launching its cloud-based insight discovery platform, which aims to deliver insight derived from massive datasets quickly, without relying on queries. The machine learning platform combines computer science with a branch of mathematics called âTopological Data Analysis,â which allows Ayasdi to visualize entire datasets at once.

The startupâs platform uses hundreds of machine learning algorithms to explore these complex datasets â the goal being the automatic discovery of insights that could not be discovered through ad hoc or query-based methods. The platform, which is designed for domain experts, data scientists and researchers, requires no coding or modeling and offers the kind of scalability that more demanding processing requires. It also is built to complement other Big Data solutions companies might already be using and is able to work with datasets of any size or type, the co-founders tell us.

The startup is currently working with enterprise customers in financial services, life sciences, oil and gas and the public sector, with these companies employing its platform to help discover new drugs, for example, improve cancer therapy by discovering new insights from an 11-year old breast cancer dataset that included new sub-populations of breast cancer survivors, for example. Itâs also being used to explore new energy sources, identifying patterns that can lead to more accurate drilling, predict fraud and help prevent terrorist attacks.

âThe answers to todayâs most important scientific, business and social problems lie in data,â saus Ayasdi CEO Gurjeet Singh. âThe biggest challenge in Big Data today is asking the right questions of data, so the real opportunity in Big Data lies in the automation of insight discovery â regardless of the complexity of that data â without requiring users to ask questions. The goal is for Ayasdi to provide users with answers to questions that they didnât know to ask in the first place.â",nam
103,"At least three people were killed and 17 others were wounded in two back-to-back explosions in Afghanistanâs northern province of Balkh.

The incident happened on Thursday in Shulgara district at approximately 11am (06:30 GMT), the provincial governorâs spokesman, Munir Ahmad Farhad, told the dpa news agency.

According to the official, the blasts happened as a result of two bombs placed inside the vehicle and the guesthouse of a well-known pro-government commander in the district.

The local commander identified as Nazar Gul and 16 of his armed men were wounded in the explosions, while his son and two of his guests were killed, Farhad said.

Local officials described Gul as an anti-Taliban figure who has played an important role in the mobilisation of people in support of the central government in the district.

The Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attack in a tweet, saying they were planning an operation.

Taliban fighters are active in the province and usually carry out attacks on pro-government forces.

Although the government in Kabul and the Taliban launched unprecedented peace talks in September, fighting has raged across the country as the Taliban has launched devastating attacks on provincial capitals and security installations, with fears the violence may jeopardise negotiations.

Attacks against Afghan forces and civilians were 50 percent higher in the three months to the end of September when compared with the previous quarter, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in its quarterly report to the US Congress.

The watchdog reported 2,561 civilian casualties this quarter, including 876 deaths, up 43 percent from the April-June period.

104,"At the request of the UN Country Team Moldova, UNDP Global Anti-corruption Initiative (GAIN) together with UNDPâs Istanbul Regional Hub and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) organized a workshop on âIntegration of Anti-corruption into UN Programmingâ on 12 April 2016. The one-day workshop brought together 16 members of the UN Moldova Country Team from nine UN agencies.

Corruption in Moldova remains an issue of high visibility and at the center of most debates. The economic, political and social context of Moldova has been tense and volatile in 2015 and the impact has been carried on into 2016. Within this context, elaboration of the new UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) of Moldova for 2017-2020 needs to ensure it addresses issues of corruption and anti-corruption and integrates related concerns into its programming.

To facilitate this conversation and to equip the UN teams with the relevant tools, methodologies, and programming entry points, the workshop sought to create space to reflect and work specifically on the anti-corruption aspect of UNDAF formulation. The objective of the workshop was to ensure a uniform understanding of the impact of corruption on development in Moldova, specifically given current contexts, and the importance of taking corruption and anti-corruption into account in programming.

The outcomes of the workshop were two-fold: First, the UN Country Team came to a common understanding that without addressing corruption risks in the areas that each UN agency is responsible for, it will not be possible to achieve any tangible results for development. Second, the participants got practical knowledge on what the anti-corruption entry points are in their respective areas and what specific anti-corruption actions could be integrated into the new UNDAF.

Taking advantage of the presence of the GAIN team and anti-corruption specialist from the Istanbul Regional Hub, the UNDP Moldova Team also requested a one-day training for its project managers and officers. The training brought together more than 30 participants from UNDP Moldova and focused on the issues of impact of corruption on UNDP programming, mainstreaming anti-corruption in UNDP programming, specifically project planning, including quality assurance screenings, tools, indicators, as well as integrating anti-corruption in UNDPâs work plan.

GAIN also shared all the online tools, courses, methodologies, and knowledge products that it has developed. The UNDP Moldova team found these useful and applicable to their work. The training resulted in increased understanding by the participants about the negative impact of corruption on UNDP programming and hands-on guidance on how to integrate anti-corruption into existing projects implemented by UNDP Moldova. Participants also got familiarised with UNDPâs approach on anti-corruption and all the resources that they can tap into when elaborating respective interventions.

Prior to the training the GAIN team also met with the deputy commissioner of Moldovaâs National Anti-Corruption Commission, members of the Moldovan Parliament, as well as the UN Operations Management Team. The discussion with the deputy commissioner of the National Anti-Corruption Commission related to current legislative initiatives that aim to improve the overall anti-corruption environment in Moldova and optimize anti-corruption efforts in the country.

In its meeting with Moldovan parliamentarians, GAIN discussed the planned launching of a Moldovan chapter of Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC), an initiative supported by UNDP Moldovaâs Parliamentary Strengthening project. The meeting with the Operations Management Team related to improving the UNâs internal transparency and accountability, with GAIN offering some practical recommendations that could help UN Moldova further promote transparency and accountability in-house.",nam
105,"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has certified as urgent the passage of the bill that will strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering law.

In his letters to Senate President Vicente Sotto 3rd and Speaker Lord Allan Velasco on Friday, Duterte certified as urgent Senate Bill 1412 and its counterpart bill in the House, House Bill 6174, which seeks to strengthen Republic Act (RA) 9160 or the âAnti-Money Laundering Act of 2001.â

The President said he wanted the immediate passage of the measure for the Philippines âto comply with legal standards for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing, as established by relevant international bodies.â

Under RA 9160, the State is mandated to protect and preserve the integrity and confidentiality of bank accounts and to ensure that the Philippines will not be used as a money laundering site for the proceeds of any unlawful activity.

RA 1405, meanwhile, forbids the disclosure of or inquiry into deposits with any banking institution, unless the depositor gives permission, or a competent court orders the examination of bank accounts.

âSuch compliance will avoid adverse findings against the country which could lead, among others, to increased costs of doing financial transactions, to the prejudice of the business sector and our overseas Filipino workers,â Duterte said in his letter to Congress.

Bills certified as urgent are exempt from a rule requiring lawmakers to study the measure for at least three days before voting on it.

This is the third time this week that the President certified bills as urgent.

On Wednesday, Duterte certified as urgent a bill seeking to grant the countryâs chief executive powers to streamline the issuance of licenses and permits in times of national emergencies.

The Senate version of the bill was passed on third reading on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the House counterpart bill was passed on Friday.

Duterte had met with Senate and House leaders to ask for the passage of a measure that would eliminate red tape and corruption in government.

He offered to be invited as resource person during the billâs deliberations but did not push through with his Senate appearance.

Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, has said it could start charging for ""basic banking services"" in some countries after it reported a 35% fall in quarterly profits.

It said it was considering charging for products such as current accounts, which are free to UK customers.

The bank said it was losing money on a ""large number"" of such accounts.

A spokesman later told the BBC it was committed to continuing to provide free ""basic bank accounts"" in the UK .

But they added: ""We always keep under review the pricing for our standard current accounts and associated services.""

Very few banks charge for standard bank accounts, but experts say this could change if the UK falls into negative interest rates due to the pandemic.

That would see the Bank of England take interest rates below zero to help boost consumer spending and revive the economy.

HSBC reported a 35% fall in pre-tax profit during the third quarter of the year to $3.1bn (Â£2.3bn), while revenues fell 11%.

Along with other banks, it has seen earnings hit amid an environment of rock bottom interest rates, and so is now considering other ways of boosting revenues.

The lender also said it would accelerate its restructuring plan, cutting costs further than previously suggested.

But HSBC, which is in the midst of cutting 35,000 jobs, did not say whether more jobs would now go. It said it would provide details on the plan with its full-year results next February.

'Promising results'

Despite the tough environment, HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn said there were some bright spots.

""These were promising results against a backdrop of the continuing impacts of Covid-19 on the global economy,"" he said.

""I'm pleased with the significantly lower credit losses in the quarter, and we are moving at pace to adapt our business model to a protracted low interest rate environment.""

HSBC had set aside between $8bn and $13bn for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, it now says its expenses are likely to be at the lower end of that range.

In September, HSBC's share price fell to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations that the bank had allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world, even after learning of the scam.

The bank has also faced recent criticism from the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for supporting China's controversial security legislation in Hong Kong.

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, HSBC was restructuring with a plan to cut $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) of costs by 2022.",am

Where once bribery, corruption and illicit financial flows were often considered part of the cost of doing business, today corruption is widely â and rightly â understood as criminal and corrosive. The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, our plan to end poverty and ensure lives of dignity for all, recognizes the need to fight corruption in all its aspects and calls for significant reductions in illicit financial flows as well as for the recovery of stolen assets.

Corruption has disastrous impacts on development when funds that should be devoted to schools, health clinics and other vital public services are instead diverted into the hands of criminals or dishonest officials.

Corruption exacerbates violence and insecurity. It can lead to dissatisfaction with public institutions, disillusion with government in general, and spirals of anger and unrest.

The United Nations Convention against Corruption provides a comprehensive platform for governments, non-governmental organizations, civil society, and individual citizens. Through prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and assets recovery, the Convention advances global progress toward ending corruption.

109,"What Is Anti Money Laundering (AML)?

Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the laws, regulations and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. Though anti-money laundering laws cover a limited range of transactions and criminal behavior, their implications are far-reaching. For example, AML regulations require banks and other financial institutions that issue credit or accept customer deposits to follow rules that ensure they are not aiding money-laundering.ï»¿

How Anti Money Laundering Works

AML laws and regulations target criminal activities including market manipulation, trade in illegal goods, corruption of public funds and tax evasion, as well as the methods used to conceal these crimes and the money derived from them.

Criminals often ""launder"" money they obtain through illegal acts such as drug trafficking so the funds cannot be easily traced to them. One common technique is to run the money through a legitimate cash-based business owned by the criminal organization or its confederates. The supposedly legitimate business deposits the money, which the criminals can then withdraw.

Money launderers may also sneak cash into foreign countries to deposit, deposit cash in smaller increments to avoid arousing suspicion, or use illicit cash to buy other cash instruments. Launderers will sometimes invest the money, using dishonest brokers willing to ignore the rules in return for large commissions.

One rule in place is the AML holding period, which requires deposits to remain in an account for a minimum of five trading days. This holding period is intended to help in anti-money laundering and risk management.

Reporting Suspicious Activity

It's up to financial institutions to monitor customer deposits and other transactions to ensure they aren't part of a money-laundering scheme. The institutions must verify the origin of large sums, monitor suspicious activities, and report cash transactions exceeding $10,000.ï»¿ ï»¿ In addition to complying with AML laws, financial institutions must ensure clients are aware of them.

Money-laundering investigations by law enforcement often involve scrutinizing financial records for inconsistencies or suspicious activity. In today's regulatory environment, extensive records are kept on just about every significant financial transaction. So when police attempt to trace a crime to its perpetrators, few methods are more effective than examining the records of connected financial transactions.

In cases of robbery, embezzlement or larceny, law enforcement are often able to return the funds or property uncovered during a money-laundering investigation to the victims of the crime. For example, if an agency discovers money a criminal laundered to cover up embezzlement, the agency can usually trace it back to those from whom the funds were embezzled.

AML vs. KYC

While closely related, there is a difference between AML and know your client (KYC) rules.ï»¿ In banking, KYC rules are the steps institutions must take to verify their customers' identities. AML operates on a broader level: they are the measures institutions take to prevent and combat money laundering, terrorism financing and other financial crimes. Banks use AML and KYC compliance to maintain secure financial institutions.

History of Anti Money Laundering

Anti-money laundering initiatives rose to global prominence in 1989, when a group of countries and organizations around the world formed the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Its mission is to devise international standards to prevent money laundering and promote their implementation. In October 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, FATF expanded its mandate to include combating terrorist financing.ï»¿

Another important organization in the fight against money laundering is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Like the FATF, the IMF has pressed its 189 member countries to comply with international standards to thwart terrorist financing.ï»¿",nam

UNDP has been focusing its support to the fight against corruption in Kosovo starting from 2006 by helping establish the Anti-Corruption Agency. Support has been provided in drafting relevant legislation and policies to equip institutions with mechanisms and knowledge on how to best prevent and fight pervasive corruption.

With the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), from 2012 UNDPâs interventions in the sector have been significantly strengthened. During the first phase of the biggest UNDP anti-corruption programme in the region, the Kosovo anti-corruption team, together with partners from institutions and civil society, have been working hard to improve citizensâ lives by increasing institutional transparency, strengthening their capabilities, and engaging them in decision-making processes.

This programme helped introduce corruption risk assessments in key sectors considered to be most prone to corruption by citizens, namely health and education. It helped introduce and implement Integrity Plans, which in practice are anti-corruption guides to strengthen institutional integrity and increase citizensâ trust.

Through its work, the anti-corruption team has been the driving force behind the first initiatives in Kosovo on open data, which have included opening up government data, its re-use, and awareness raising activities. Seeing the potential that it has in Kosovo, the team streamlined more of their efforts towards piloting and promoting open data activities.

The team introduced Kosovoâs first-ever âhackathonsâ to help institutions address their business problems. Youth from all around Kosovo gathered to develop applications on e-procurement, e-spending, and e-recruitment that are now utilised by institutions to prevent corruption in these areas.

Furthermore, to strengthen the civil society and citizensâ role in the fight against corruption, in 2012 UNDP Kosovo, jointly with implementing partner Internews Kosova, created the online platform www.kallxo.com (in Albanian âdo tellâ). We used the Ushahidi platform and www.ipadabribe.com as a reference.

Today, according to an independent poll, this platform is the fourth most trusted mechanism to report corruption, after the Anti-Corruption Agency and the police, with over 6,000 incidences of corruption reported by citizens.

During its next phase, 2016â2020, the anti-corruption programme will expand to cover municipalities and central level institutions to equip them with tools to prevent and fight corruption. Special emphasis will be placed on strengthening the role of the Parliament, reviewing existing legislation and implementing UNCAC requirements, and empowering vulnerable and marginalized groups through awareness raising and better access to information.

UNDP has launched a campaign throughout Kosovo to spread the message on increasing citizensâ knowledge on negative impacts of corruption and providing information on ways they can improve their lives by fighting corruption. The focus of the campaign is to name and shame anyone who is willingly engaged in a corrupt practice: Arenât you ashamed? Donât become one of them, report corruption now!

UNDPâs anti-corruption efforts in Kosovo was acknowledged recently in a story in The Guardian, as part of a series on anti-corruption initiatives around the world that have translated into real change. UNDP Kosovo was acknowledged for its work in digitizing public services at the municipal level.

â[Because] there is a 40% unemployment rate in Kosovo, recruitment is very often prone to bribes,â Shqipe Neziri Vela, Manager of the Anti-Corruption Programme at UNDP Kosovo, told The Guardian. âOne way we are helping local governments to prevent corrupt practices by public service personnel is to put their entire recruitment process online. Weâve also used social innovation challenges and hackathons to build tools that show budget expenditures in real time.â",nam
111,"Banks in Cyprus are concerned that their adoption of some of the toughest anti-money laundering regulations in the world has not been fully recognized abroad, the chief of the Association of Cyprus Banks said Monday.

Association Director Michalis Kammas said that banks are challenging ""outdated perceptions"" and are working to raise awareness about reform efforts.

Kammas says more rigorous supervision and directives have led to the closure of a ""significant number"" of bank accounts since 2014.

""Today, Cypriot banks' procedures encompass some of the most advanced banking compliance practices globally,"" Kammas told the Associated Press in an email.

Kammas said international supervisory bodies like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Transparency International have recognized Cyprus' strong efforts but that the message hadn't gotten through to some stakeholders, including the media.

Prior to a 2013 banking sector crisis that brought Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy, the east Mediterranean island nation, which is an EU member, was hounded by allegations that it was a tax and money laundering haven.

Kammas said the crisis hit home with Cypriot authorities that they had to clean up the banking system and that pressure to do so had come ""as much from political commitment within as it has from outside authorities.""

He said Cyprus is working closely with foreign supervisory authorities from the EU and the U.S. to ensure that financial sector legislation is fully in line with international best practices.

Some of the key reforms include obligatory face-to-face meetings between banks and account owners and strong regulations on disclosing the individual who is the ultimate holder of a bank account.

Earlier this year, Cyprus also introduced new shell company regulations that prohibit Cypriot banks from doing business with entities that are identified as shell companies.",nam
112,"Elavon, the payments provider, today announces a partnership with Featurespace, to help tackle fraud attacks in real-time and simplify the online payments experience for consumers.

With the use of Featurespaceâs innovative ARICâ¢ Platform, Elavon is developing a fraud network to detect fraudulent activity using adaptive behavioural analytics.

Elavonâs fraud network comes as Europe prepares for the second Payments Services Directive (PSD2) that requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to have affect from September 2019. PSD2 will compel processors, merchants and banks to adopt more effective security checks for online payments in order to reduce card fraud in Europe.

According to a report published by the European Central Bank, Card-Not-Present fraud made up 73% of all card fraud in Europe. Two-factor authentication will be compulsory for all eCommerce transactions above â¬30, unless an acquirer exempts the payment from additional authentication with the issuer.

Elavonâs network detects instances of fraud to help mitigate the need for additional security checks, which can make the online shopping experience more complicated. Research from Elavonâs report, â Pocket Shoppers: eCommerce on the Move â found that two-thirds of consumers will abandon an online purchase if the process is too difficult, leading to a higher rate of cart abandonment.

Combining the Featurespace ARICâ¢ platform and Elavonâs 3DS service enables merchants to use an advanced, layered approach to fraud prevention. The ARICâ¢ platform uses machine learning transaction monitoring to build individual behavioural profiles for cardholders and merchants in real-time. This system works to detect anomalies and prevent fraud across all payment methods and channels.

Hannah Fitzsimons, EVP and General Manager of Elavon Merchant Services commented: âElavon is delighted to work with Featurespace to bring top fraud prevention solutions to market to protect merchants and consumers. We are committed to developing the most innovative fraud and security solutions in the payments industry.â

Martina King, CEO of Featurespace said: â1.3 million customers worldwide rely on Elavon to safeguard their businesses. Working together means we will be staying one step ahead of criminals at all times. It is an honour to have been selected to protect Elavon and their clients.â",nam
113,"The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, is under fresh pressure after it emerged that she appeared to have dismissed intelligence briefings from counter- terrorism police to the Home Office over an alleged far-right terror attack.

Officers from S015, the Metropolitan police counter terrorism command (CTC), notified the Home Office in mid-September that it was suspected that a far-right extremist had attempted to carry out a terror attack at a solicitorsâ firm in London.

Weeks later, on 4 October at the Conservative party conference, the home secretary intensified her criticism of â do goodersâ and âlefty lawyers.â

On Saturday night, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, the shadow home secretary, said: âThe home secretary has fallen short of the high standards that the role demands. The use of such reprehensible and inflammatory language undermines the most important part of her job, which is to keep people safe.â

Officers from SO15 were drafted in to investigate the attack on law firm Duncan Lewis, which occurred on 7 September after it became evident that extremism might be involved.

Accounts from the firm, including eyewitness statements, formed part of the investigation.

On Friday, alleged far-right extremist Cavan Medlock, 28, from Harrow in north-west London, was charged with attempting to launch a terror attack at the law firm last month.

The Old Bailey heard that Medlock arrived at Duncan Lewisâs offices armed with a knife, handcuffs, a Nazi flag and a US Confederate flag with prosecutors saying he appeared to target the firm because of its involvement with immigration cases.

Previously, the Observer has revealed that Patel ignored warnings from senior colleagues including the lord chancellor and attorney general as well as officials from the Bar Council and Law Society to stop targeting immigration lawyers following the incident. Sources say the Met notified MI5 and the Home Office last month of the incident and its far-right links.

Separately, senior Home Office officials involved in its counter-extremism portfolio have said they were made aware of a suspected far-right attack before Patel resumed her attacks on immigration lawyers at the Tory party conference.

A spokesperson for the Met confirmed that it was protocol to share intelligence and details following a suspected terrorist incident with the Home Office: âCounter terrorism policing works closely with colleagues from MI5 and the Home Office in the course of our investigative activity. This includes sharing, as and where appropriate, certain information and intelligence relating to our work with these partners.âThey added: âThere are well established protocols in place to brief government on the police response following major incidents, including terrorist attacks.â

The chronology of events raises questions as to why Patel chose to keep attacking the legal profession. According to government documents, her remit is being âresponsible for making sure our communities, in all [police] force areas, are kept safe and secureâ.

An online Home Office fact sheet on rightwing terrorism pledges that the department is committed to tackling far-right attacks, stating: âThe threat from rightwing terrorism has evolved in recent years and is growing. That is why this government is taking urgent action to tackle it.â

In addition, Patel has oversight of the security service MI5, which last year was given responsibility to take the lead in tackling rightwing terrorism, officially designated as a major threat to national security. This month, the new head of MI5 warned of its growing threat. Out of 27 terrorist plots disrupted in the past four years, eight have involved rightwing extremists.

In addition, Patelâs department presides over the governmentâs counter extremism strategy, Prevent, which aims to help vulnerable individuals people from being radicalised to supporting terrorism.

âWith any case of domestic terrorism you need to look at the reasons behind it, its inspiration. This is why this is so serious,â said a source with knowledge of the case.

They added: âIf you had a dubious politician abroad inciting hatred and then a UK terror incident was traced back to what this politician had said then you can only imagine the measures that would be taken.â",nam
114,"VIENNA: FIFA would help fund a global agency to tackle corruption in sport, its president Gianni Infantino said on Monday.
Creating a body like the World Anti-Doping Agency to address financial corruption, match-fixing and the influence of organized crime in sport has been talked about for more than a decade without a detailed proposal.
""We at FIFA are ready to invest in it,"" Infantino said, suggesting ""maybe the creation of such an agency would help make sport safe in the decades to come.""
As Infantino spoke at a United Nations event in Austria, the corruption trial was opening in Switzerland of three men, including Qatari soccer and television executive Nasser al-Khelaifi and former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.
Their case arose from years-long American and Swiss investigations of suspected corruption in soccer that removed a generation of international leaders from office and helped lift Infantino to the FIFA presidency in 2016.
His funding pledge was made when signing a cooperation agreement between FIFA and the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which connects international officials and programs.
Speakers at the event included diplomats from Russia and Qatar, winners of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting votes in 2010 that FIFA later asked Swiss federal prosecutors to investigate.
No convictions have been secured in Switzerland, though criminal proceedings are also open against Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter and former UEFA President Michel Platini for alleged mismanagement of FIFA funds not directly linked to World Cup bidding. They were questioned in the past two weeks.
""Never again. Never again corruption in football,"" said Infantino, who is himself under investigation in Switzerland over meetings he had with then-attorney general Michael Lauber.
Lauber left office two weeks ago after being disciplined for failing to declare a June 2017 meeting with Infantino where he took no notes and misleading a subsequent internal investigation.",am
115,"Foreign prosecutors are increasingly asking the UK for help in tax crime investigations, new figures suggest.

According to research by Thomson Reuters, the number of information requests relating to tax offences received by the UK government rose 44% last year; from 103 in 2017 to 148 in 2018.

Requests to the government require businesses or individuals to provide documents, such as transaction histories or bank statements, within a certain time period. They can also require people to give evidence in court.

The increase in the number of requests reflects growing cooperation between international law enforcement agencies. According to Thomson Reuters, tax offences are increasingly cross-border, making it harder to gather evidence necessary for prosecution and prompting greater collaboration between countries.

Brian Peccarelli, chief operating officer at Thomson Reuters, said: âTax authorities globally are increasingly working together to stamp out tax evasion. Deeply integrated economies and lengthy supply chains mean investigating tax offences can be very difficult without collaboration. Information sharing networks can therefore be very important in increasing the chances of locating the offenders.â

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development has announced proposals aimed at reducing corporate tax avoidance and evasion. The proposals would see an increase in the rights of countries to levy tax on corporate income earned from sales in their jurisdictions, regardless of which jurisdiction those profits are actually recorded in.",nam

India now accounts for as much as one-fourth of the world's illegal cigarette market, according to a report by tobacco industry body The Tobacco Institute of India (TII). Illegal cigarettes have more than doubled from 12.5 billion sticks in 2005 to 26.5 billion sticks in 2018, the report noted quoting Euromonitor International data.

One of the key reasons behind the rise in illegal cigarettes trading, which hit a record high during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, is extremely high tax. âExtremely high and constantly increasing tax rates on cigarettes provide a profitable opportunity for tax evasion thereby encouraging growth in illegal trade,â the report noted.

The report points out that the legal cigarette industry in India is suffering due to high taxation on cigarettes over the years particularly between 2012-13 and 2017-18.

""The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime introduced in July 2017, increased the tax burden on cigarettes by increasing the GST compensation cess rates by a weighted average of about 13 per cent over the pre-GST tax rates,â the report found.

It further added, ""The huge increase in National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 is likely to provide a further boost to the illicit tax evaded cigarette trade in the country.""

India is the worldâs second-largest producer and a major exporter of tobacco, which provides livelihood to 45.7 million people. The industry body pointed out that tobacco products generate tax revenue to the tune of Rs 43,000 crore annually.

Lopez Obrador's comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

""We have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEA's historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard also expressed dismay at the United States' failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos. ""We have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),"" Lopez Obrador said.

""But there are still issues we want to clarify. We're only waiting for the elections to pass,"" he said of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term.

âWe also expect that the international community would extend their full support to us, in order to materialize corruption free society which was a dream of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is the liberator of Bangladesh, and the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in 1971 for establishing a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh,â Minister Huq said.

He said, âArticle 20 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh provides that as a general principle, no person shall be able to enjoy unearned incomes meaning that the Constitution being the supreme law of Bangladesh prohibits corruptionâ.

123,"In brief

The new corporate liability provision under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (â Section 17A â) has come into force on 1 June 2020. As highlighted in our earlier client alert (see Link), a company may be held criminally liable under this new provision for acts of bribery committed by its directors, employees or other associated persons. The only defence available is for the company to prove that it has put in place adequate procedures designed to prevent these corrupt acts.

This new corporate liability provision applies not only to Malaysian companies, but also to foreign companies with businesses in Malaysia.

Impact on Foreign Companies

The new Section 17A applies to all foreign companies and partnerships which carry on businesses in Malaysia. Although the Act is silent as to what amounts to âcarrying out businessâ in Malaysia, it is likely that a foreign entity will fall within the ambit of Section 17A if it carries on business in Malaysia through an agent or intermediary such as a distributor or reseller and/or through a subsidiary.

The following are examples of two scenarios where a foreign company may be exposed to liability under Section 17A:

Foreign companyâs employees or agents pay a bribe in Malaysia

A foreign company may be liable for an offence under Section 17A of the Act if its employees, agents or persons associated with it bribes or attempts to give a bribe in Malaysia to obtain or retain business or business advantage for the company.

Foreign companyâs subsidiary pays a bribe in Malaysia

A foreign company may also be liable if its subsidiary bribes or attempts to give a bribe in Malaysia to obtain or retain business or business advantage. This is illustrated in the first prosecution under the UK Bribery Act 2020 in the case of R v Sweett Group plc (â Sweett â) (unreported)(2015), whereby a subsidiary of Sweett paid a bribe in the Middle East to secure a project. Notwithstanding that, the subsidiary engaged in the bribery without the involvement or knowledge of its parent company and that the contract was awarded to the subsidiary, the judge took into account the fact that the subsidiary was not autonomous but was effectively operated by Sweett as a division in the Middle East.

For completeness, we wish to highlight that liability may not accrue through simple corporate ownership or investment, or through the payment of dividends or provision of loans by a subsidiary to its parents. The degree of control of the Malaysian subsidiary will be a relevant factor whether liability is extended to a foreign holding company under Section 17A.

Action to consider

The penalties arising from liability under Section 17A is a fine not less than 10 times the value of the bribe or MYR 1 million (whichever is higher) and/or imprisonment of a term not exceeding 20 years.

In light of this, foreign companies with businesses in Malaysia should take steps to assess their risk and to consider putting in place the required adequate procedures which is the only defence available for corporates arising from liability under Section 17A. Please refer to our previous client alert here on how to comply with the requisite adequate procedures under Section 17A.",am

The research report, â Online Payment Fraud: Emerging Threats, Segment Analysis & Market Forecasts 2020-2024 â, found that the increasing ubiquity of digital payments provides an ever-increasing attack surface for fraudsters.

According to the study, digital money transfer is a growing area for payment fraud, with losses growing by 130% from 2020 to 2024. Digital money transfer fraud is particularly strong in emerging markets, with payments vulnerable to SIM swapping fraud and synthetic identities, with less robust security measures in place.

Machine Learning to Defend Against Online Frauds

The research also highlighted that machine learning has become a crucial tool in the fraud detection and prevention arsenal as it enables payments industry stakeholders to analyze transaction flows in a holistic way, unlocking hidden insights on fraudulent behaviors. It also stated that the incorporation of machine-learning into fraud detection and prevention software will drive spending forward, reaching US$10 billion in 2024, a 15% increase from 2020.

Research co-author Nick Maynard said, âThe rapidly evolving nature of payment fraud and increased sophistication in attack methods requires machine learning adoption at scale, in order to minimize risk. Constant innovation in analytics and data models is increasingly essential to constraining fraudulent behaviors in paymentsâ.

Earlier, in similar research, Juniper revealed that Asia-Pacific (APAC) service providers were concerned over their security infrastructure as they adopted new technologies like distributed clouds, IoT, and 5G.

The findings are based on the responses of IT decision-makers from service providers across APAC. The report also highlighted that increased adoption of new technologies forced service providers to scale up and scale-out their security infrastructure to remain relevant and secure.",nam
129,"In an attack on French President Emmanuel Macronâs defense of the right to show cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which many Muslims consider disrespectful and blasphemous, Iran's supreme leader has equated Holocaust denial with perceived insults against Islam's prophet.

The remarks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei resulted in renewed calls on Twitter to add a warning label to Khameneiâs tweets or remove his account, with some saying Iranâs top authority should not be allowed to spread ""anti-Semitism"" on social-media networks.

Khameneiâs October 28 comments addressed to âYoung French Peopleâ were posted in Persian, French, and English on his website, as well as on social-media sites including Twitter.

In the short message, the Iranian leader said Macronâs move was a âstupid act.â

Macron has defended secular values following the killing of 47-year-old schoolteacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in his classroom after allowing any students who might be offended to leave.

Macron has paid tribute to Paty, saying he was ""killed because he was teaching students about freedom of speech, the freedom to believe and to not believe.""
âAsk your president why he supports insulting Godâs Messenger in the name of freedom of expression. Does freedom of expression mean insulting, especially a sacred personage?â Khamenei asked. âIsnât this stupid act an insult to the reason of the [people] who elected him?â he added.

Khamenei then compared insults against the Prophet Muhammad with Holocaust denial, which is banned in some countries, including Germany.

âWhy is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust? Why should anyone who writes about such doubts be imprisoned while insulting the Prophet (pbuh) is allowed?â

Khameneiâs tweets were met with criticism, including by Jonathan Greensblatt, the national director and chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who said, âHolocaust denialism is hate, pure & simple.â

âWhy is Khamenei allowed to consistently espouse anti-Semitism that clearly violates Twitter policy on hate speech?â added Greensblatt, who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor who escaped Nazi Germany.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center also blasted Khameneiâs tweet, saying, âNo Ayatollah, the real question is why @Twitter gives you a free pass to use their platform to push your genocidal threats of Final Solution against the worldâs largest Jewish community -- the Democratic State of Israel?â

Khameneiâs tweets coincided with a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, as well as the chief executives of Facebook and Google, were questioned on issues dealing with free speech and content moderation.

At the hearing, Dorsey was asked by Republican senators why tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump have been flagged for containing âmisleading or potentially harmful informationâ but controversial tweets by other world leaders and dictators have been not been met with action.

Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker specifically asked Dorsey about four tweets by Khamenei which, he said, glorified violence. They included a tweet posted in May that said: ""We will support and assist any nation or any group anywhere who opposes and fights the Zionist regime, and we do not hesitate to say this.""

Iranian officials refer to Israel as the Zionist regime. The Islamic republic, home to the Middle Eastâs largest population of Jews outside of Israel, does not recognize Israel.

âWe did not find those to violate our terms of service because we consider them saber-rattling, which is part of the speech of world leaders in concert with other countries,â Dorsey responded.

âSpeech against our own people or a countryâs own citizens we believe is different and can cause more immediate harm,â Dorsey added.

In 2019, Khameneiâs Twitter account was temporarily banned for reiterating a fatwa issued by the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, against author Salman Rushdie.

âImam Khomeiniâs verdict regarding Salman Rushdie is based on divine verses and just like divine verses, it is solid and irrevocable,â the tweet posted by @Khamenei_ir had said.

A Twitter spokesman said then that the tweet violated the platformâs rules.

âItâs against our rules to make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people,â the spokesman said then.

Khameneiâs Twitter account was reactivated after the tweet's removal.

In the past, some critics have suggested that Khamenei and other Iranian officials should not be allowed to use Twitter as long as it remains blocked inside the country.

Others say Twitter is one of the few platforms where Iranians can challenge and criticize comments by their leaders, including Khamenei, criticism of whom is considered a red line in Iran that has landed many in prison.

One such reaction came on October 28 from former political prisoner Zia Nabavi, who spent nearly nine years in prison after being arrested following the disputed 2009 presidential election and a brutal state crackdown that followed.

âYou cannot give guidance on freedom of expression in France when your [own] criticism in your country can result in two years in prison,â Nabavi said, without naming Khamenei.",nam
130,"PANJIM: The State Legislative Assembly of Telangana recently passed an innovative legislation eliminating the need for permissions and approvals of building plans by introducing a new selfcertification system.

The Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS) Bill was passed by the Telangana House unanimously on 14 September, ending decades of cumbersome procedures and corrupt practices including never ending waiting periods for approval of building plans.

Now, residents of Telangana will no longer need any permission from municipal corporations and other urban bodies in urban areas for starting construction activity.

The Bill was passed without any objections. The minister introducing the bill said the TS-bPASS was a self-certification system to make citizens responsible and ensure that they adhere to the building and layout permission rules of the state government.

As per the new law, people constructing a building within 75 square yards land need not obtain any permission from the authorities concerned. However, they must register with the urban local body using TS-bPASS. The citizens can also obtain instant permission for constructions on 75 square yards to 600 square yards through self-certification under TS-bPASS and commence their construction work without the need to pay bribes to get maps and building plans approved. However, for construction in lots of a size bigger than 600 square yards, the authorities concerned will examine the applications seeking permissions and issue necessary permissions within 21 days. In case of shortfall of any documents, the same will be intimated to the applicant within 10 days.

Under the new law, all municipalities are mandated to clear all the building permit applications within the stipulated 21 days failing which the permission is deemed to have been approved.

âFurther, an automated certificate will be issued to the applicant with the signatures of relevant authorities including the municipal commissioner and the town planning officer on behalf of the municipality concerned, to enable them to obtain bank loans or other financial assistance,â the minister said.

The occupancy certificates also will be issued within 15 days upon submitting relevant documents. As a check, the new law empowers authorities to demolish the structure without any prior notice if the construction is unauthorised or illegal in any manner that includes construction on someone elseâs land.",nam
131,"MANILA: The Philippine central bank said on Thursday (Sep 3) that no account holder funds had been lost at the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) after the state-lender reported it had suffered a ""cyber incident"" earlier this year.

The central bank would ensure the safety and integrity of the financial system, and the protection of financial consumers, central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno told reporters.

""The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is well-aware of the reported UCPB incident and has been in close coordination with the bank since the early part of its investigation,"" Diokno said.

UCPB, the country's 13th largest bank in asset terms, said it was reviewing and strengthening its information technology and security controls following the June incident.

""UCPB remains ... a strong and profitable institution,"" the bank said in a statement on Thursday.

The bank did not comment on any losses sustained, but the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that UCPB lost 167 million pesos (US$3.44 million) from criminals through automated teller machine withdrawals and electronic fund transfers.

In June, the Philippines was embroiled in a scandal at German payments firm Wirecard AG, which said US$2.1 billion of missing funds were deposited at two Philippine banks, a claim denied by the central bank and the lenders.

Nonetheless, the case has heightened fears that fraudsters are targeting the Southeast Asian country's financial system.

Four years ago, unknown criminals used fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system to steal US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The money was sent to accounts at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp and then vanished into Philippine casinos.

The finance ministry and the Anti-Money Laundering Council on Thursday signed a deal to work together to detect, investigate, and prosecute anyone suspected of money laundering or being involved in terrorism financing.",nam
132,"The Group of States against Corruption (Greco) came to the sobering assessment in two recently published reports.

Luxembourg has not made any progress since March 2019, according to the interim compliance report by Greco which was adopted at the end of October. This report focuses on the recommendations pertaining to members of parliament, judges, and prosecutors. In total, only four out of 14 recommendations had been implemented since 2013.

Greco even identified a setback in one area. The group previously recommended that the Grand Duchy should strengthen the independency and neutrality of the public prosecutor's office. An amendment to the constitution was supposed to implement this recommendation, but due to the Christian Social People's Party's opposition to the amendment, the Chamber of Deputies is no longer able to pass it.

- Second report -

The second report deals with ""preventing corruption and promoting integrity in central governments and law enforcement agencies"".

Greco determined that Luxembourg had implemented one third of its recommendations in this area. Ten recommendations were only partially implemented, while four had so far been ignored.

The Group welcomed the introduction of declarations of potential conflicts of interest for MPs, but criticised that they were not ""illustrative, specific, and complete"" enough. Greco stressed that relations to lobbyists or conflicts of interest have to clarified.

Greco also welcomed the introduction of ""open administration"", i.e. the right of citizens to access administrative documents. The new professional ethics code for government officials, which was introduced in 2019, also received praise, with Greco's only criticism being that certain assessments of the ethics committee should be made public.

- Police force -

The report also included a very positive assessment of Luxembourg's police force. The independency of the police's General Inspectorate from the police itself, now guaranteed by law, was praised. So too was the professional ethics code for policemen, which introduced disciplinary measures for police officers who accepted gifts.

Greco also approved of the introduction of identification numbers, which made it possible to easily identify an officer while they were wearing their uniform.

In regard to the recommendations which have so far only been partially implemented or not at all, Greco demands that Luxembourg make progress in the 18 months to come.",nam
133,"Responding to news that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Anti-Terrorism Act into law, Amnesty Internationalâs Asia-Pacific Regional Director, Nicholas Bequelin, said:

âUnder Duterteâs presidency, even the mildest government critics can be labelled terrorists.

âThis administration has effectively crafted a new weapon to brand and hound any perceived enemies of the state. In the prevailing climate of impunity, a law so vague on the definition of âterrorismâ can only worsen attacks against human rights defenders.

âThe approval of this law grants the government excessive and unchecked powers. Legislation aimed at âcountering terrorismâ must ensure respect for international human rights and humanitarian law and protect basic liberties.

âThis lawâs introduction is the latest example of the countryâs ever-worsening human rights record. Once again, this shows why the UN should launch a formal investigation into ongoing widespread and systematic violations in the country.â

Background

On 3 July 2020, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law the âAnti-Terrorism Act of 2020â, which replaces the Human Security Act of 2007. Amnesty International has called on the Philippine government to reject this legislation that contains dangerous provisions and risks further undermining human rights in the country.

The Act defines terrorism as:

Engaging in acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person or endangers a personâs life;
Engaging in acts intended to cause extensive damage or destruction to a government or public facility, public place, or private property;
Engaging in acts intended to cause extensive interference with, damage, or destruction to critical infrastructure;
Developing, manufacturing, possessing, acquiring, transporting, supplying, or using weapons; and
Releasing dangerous substances or causing fire, floods or explosions when the purpose is to intimidate the general public, create an atmosphere to spread a message of fear, provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any international organization, seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic, or social structures in the country, or create a public emergency or seriously undermine public safety

Under the law, persons who propose, incite, conspire, and participate in the planning, training, and facilitation an offence under the act, as well as those who provide support to âterroristsâ as defined under the act, or recruit members of a âterrorist organisationâ, could face life imprisonment without parole.

The law also punishes the following offences with 12 yearsâ imprisonment:

Threatening to commit âterrorismâ
Inciting others or proposing to commit âterrorismâ
Voluntarily and knowingly joining any âterrorist groupâ
Acting as an accessory in the commission of âterrorismâ

The law allows suspects to be detained without a judicial warrant of arrest for 14 days and can be extended by 10 more days, and placed under surveillance for 60 days, that can also be extended by up to 30 days, by the police or military.",nam
134,"It is one of the most prolific crimes on Earth, affecting almost 25 million men, women and children.

But human trafficking â the modern slave trade of living and breathing people for commercial gain â isnât occurring on some distant, dusty and lawless shore.

From domestic servitude, forced labour and forced marriage to sexual exploitation and the commercial trade in human organs, such harrowing practices steal through every nation on Earth, the UK included.

The proceeds of these crimes are the subject of intense focus by law enforcement around the world, in a bid to tackle such activities.

In the UK, specialists in a third of banks and other consumer-facing financial institutions have admitted that human trafficking already accounts for significant financial losses. Half have had to investigate criminal activity linked to human trafficking among their own customer transactions.

These businesses are obliged by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to have systems and controls in place to counter the risk that they are misused for the purposes of financial crime of all types, including human trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds.

As part of their legal obligations, financial organisations must identify customers using their services, take steps to monitor the transactions to detect those which are suspicious, and report their suspicions to the National Crime Agency (NCA).

âTraditional detection of money laundering focuses on the rapid movement of funds through accounts, discrepancies between the stated intended use (or account type) and actual usage, along with other obvious red flags,â says Rob Horton, head of financial crime solutions at BAE Systems.

As criminals evolve their techniques to evade controls, so the financial services industry must also innovate. Many of the leading banks are now applying advanced analytics to look across multiple sources of data to indicate suspected human trafficking in the underlying financial data.

That could include, for example, studying the transactional behaviour of large numbers of cash deposits as the victimsâ identities are often used to facilitate money laundering.

âWhen combined with profiling the financial transactions and online banking behaviour of these accounts, an accurate picture can be built to undercover criminal networks. There is also a human element,â Horton continues.

âNowadays branch staff are trained to spot potential âat riskâ customers, especially in the presence of further suspicion, for example visitors to the bank who are accompanied by a suspicious or controlling character.â

Anyone working in the regulated sector is required under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism Acts to submit suspicious activity reports (SARs) to the UK authorities if they know or even suspect that a person is engaged in or attempting money laundering.

Made by financial institutions and other professionals such as solicitors, accountants and estate agents, they provide intelligence from the private sector on a wide range of criminal activity, including economic crime that would otherwise not be visible to law enforcement.

SARs arenât crime reports, they are designed to flag a possible concern in case law enforcement agencies shares those concerns.

Each year, UK banks and building societies identify 20 million alerts of possible suspicious activity, investigate them, and then submit more than 400,000 SARs. Some involve a couple of hoursâ work, others take days or weeks before the firm can decide if the reporting threshold of âsuspicionâ has been reached.

Some firms also work closely with charities like Stop the Traffik to help identify and tackle human trafficking.

But a study of hundreds of professionals working in anti-money laundering, risk and fraud roles across financial, business, banking and insurance industries reveals shocking gaps in their capabilities.

More than 80 per cent are concerned that money laundering is currently happening in their customersâ transactions but two in five arenât confident they can identify the signs of human trafficking among transactions, according to a new report by BAE Systems Applied Intelligence â the cybercrime and intelligence arm of the defence, security and aerospace multinational.

More than one in 10 financial institutions still donât have an anti-money laundering strategy in place, BAE Systems has warned, despite it being a legal requirement.

Even if they do, just one in five in-house experts are confident they can stop the transactions or behaviour involved in human trafficking.

âTackling modern slavery is a priority for the NCAâs Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce where law enforcement, the financial sector and other agencies work to identify and tackle a wide range of serious crimes including human trafficking,â a spokesperson for UK Finance, the financial sectorâs trade association, said in response to the findings.

âThe sector spends over Â£5bn a year fighting economic crime, using a combination of advanced screening, monitoring technology and information sharing to target those who seek to transfer illicit funds through our financial system.

âThis includes preventing, identifying and disrupting attempts to abuse the legitimate financial system to launder the proceeds of modern slavery and human trafficking, with tackling of these crimes being an operational priority.

âAt the same time, the industry works in close partnership with the government and law enforcement through the Economic Crime Plan, using our combined powers to make the UK one of the safest and most transparent places in the world to conduct financial business.â

But it is clear that they will have to do better to demonstrate a stronger moral position to consumers if they want to keep them.

âThere has certainly been a marked shift in consumer attitudes towards banks and how they protect us over the last few years. Issues such as money laundering and trafficking are real-life human problems that are becoming more widely reported and understood,â says Horton.

âThree-quarters of [consumers] want their banks to be more transparent about this sort of criminal activity â in particular, demonstrating how it impacts customers as well as the wider society.â",nam
135,"For more than 100 days, protestors have taken to the streets of Sofia in Bulgaria.

When I had the chance to join the demonstrations in late September this year, I was surprised. Among the Bulgarian flags and posters demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, dozens of EU flags were being waved. The Bulgarian protestors were expressing their hopes for help and support from the European Union in the fight against corruption. Approval of the EU has been particularly high since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. But: the uncontrolled transfer of EU funds to Sofia is contributing to rampant corruption in the country. The EU carries a shared responsibility for the status quo.

Opposition in Bulgaria: Why does Europe not act?

In September, I had the opportunity to talk to many of those affected on the ground, including opposition members who are making urgent appeals to Brussels; journalists who were being beaten up by security forces at the protests; and young people who had come back to Bulgaria after long stays in other European countries, now wanting break up the encrusted corrupt structures in their home country.

Their unanimous opinion: the European Union must take decisive action against corruption and the dismantling of the rule of law. Otherwise, the EU will lose its integrity. Otherwise, hope will turn into frustration and people will turn away. It would be a catastrophe for the European project. It would be a heavy blow for our European community of values.

Corruption destroys trust and frustration increases

The frustration with the Bulgarian Government is deep. Corruption is part of everyday life in Bulgaria. Sometimes it's overpriced renovation projects, sometimes broken sidewalk slabs, sometimes it's a minister who admits that it's all about stuffing as much money as possible in their own pockets.

Almost everywhere you have to learn that public money is being plundered and kept by a small elite. The arrogance and egoism of the powerful destroys trust in politics. It annoys the people on the streets. And it sends a fatal signal: If you want to be successful, you have to participate in this system â or emigrate.

What can the European Union do to help?

Even small gestures can help. I was shocked to discover that 70 days after the protests began, no European politician had yet talked to the people on the ground. The European Commission should have signalled early on that it takes the concerns and demands of the protests seriously. In many conversations, participants in the protests told me that they felt abandoned. They were happy that a Green member of the European Parliament was now on the ground. And: they perceive that in Bulgaria and in the EU it is above all the Greens who are passionately fighting against corruption. Greens are perceived as pioneers for clean politics â free from corruption.

We cannot not leave the fight against corruption to the Bulgarian people alone. In Brussels, negotiations are still underway on the future EU budget and the Corona Fund. The European Parliament has made it very clear here that we can only disburse money if it is not misused for the dismantling of the rule of law. We can only distribute money if we are sure that billions of euros will not end up in the private pockets of a corrupt elite.

The rule of law in Europe is in crisis. If we do not act decisively now, we will put the future of the entire European Union at risk. Because if the EU does not act â then citizens will turn away. The crisis in Bulgaria illustrates that very clearly.",nam
136,"AMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION POLICY ON TRADING SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION

The following constitutes the policy of American Vanguard Corporation and its subsidiaries (âAVDâ or the âCompanyâ) regarding the trading of Company securities while in possession of material non-public information (âinsider tradingâ). This policy provides a general overview of insider trading based upon federal and state securities laws. As you will see, whether a transaction amounts to insider trading depends upon the facts and circumstances under which it takes place. This policy applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company.

The Companyâs Policy
It is the policy of AVD that no director, officer or employee in possession of material non-public information (âInside Informationâ) of AVD may buy or sell securities of the Company or engage in any other action or conduct to take advantage of, or pass on to others, that Inside Information. This policy also applies to trading in the securities of any other company while in possession of Inside Information about that company, including customers or suppliers, obtained in the course of your service for AVD.

Special circumstances or hardship (for example, the need to raise money for a medical emergency) are not an exception to this policy nor are they a safeguard against prosecution for violation of insider trading laws. You should avoid even the appearance of executing an improper transaction in order both to avoid possible prosecution and to preserve the Companyâs ethical reputation.

Insider Trading
Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits trading by an Insider (as defined below) of AVD securities while in possession of undisclosed material information about the Company. Please keep in mind that liability under this law can also apply to trading in the securities of any company while in possession of Inside Information about that company.

Who is an Insider?
For purposes of this policy, an Insider is any person who possesses Inside Information . The category of Insider includes not only AVDâs directors, officers and employees, but also outside professional advisors and business consultants who have access to Inside Information prior to its public release and absorption by the market.

Liability under Rule 10b-5 may attach not only to Insiders who trade while in possession of Inside Information, but also, under certain circumstances, to (i) Insiders â also known as âTippersâ - who disclose Inside Information to third parties and (ii) third parties (such as relatives, friends or business associates â also known as âTippeesâ) who receive Inside Information from Tippers and trade while in possession of that information.

This policy applies to your family members and others in your household. By âfamily memberâ we mean your spouse, partner, minor children, relative or other member of your immediate household to whose support you contribute or whose investments you control. You are responsible for ensuring the compliance of this policy by your immediate family and personal household.

What is Material Non-Public Information?
Material Information: any information that a reasonable investor would consider to be important in arriving at a decision to buy, sell or hold the stock of a company and/or would view its disclosure as altering the total mix of information about the issuer that is otherwise available.

Non-public Information: information that is not generally known to the public.

Examples: the following might be regarded as material and, if not disclosed, as non-public:

Projections of future earnings or losses;
News of a pending or proposed merger;
Acquisition or tender offer;
News of a significant sale of assets or the disposition of a subsidiary;

Change in price/cost of services or products;
Impending financial liquidity problems

Either positive or negative information may be material. The foregoing list is not exhaustive; other types of information may be material at any particular time, depending on all of the circumstances.

Trading
Insiders must refrain from trading until Inside Information has been disclosed to the public, and the market has had sufficient opportunity to absorb and evaluate it. The Companyâs policy is that Insiders may not trade until three (3) full business days after the information has been generally released to the national media. A âbusiness dayâ is any day on which trading on the national stock markets close. Thus, if the company issues a press release on a matter on a Monday before trading commences, then the Insider must wait until the passage of three full trading days â Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday â before executing a trade â that is, Thursday, at the soonest.

The Consequences of Insider Trading
For individuals who trade on material non-public information (or tip information to others) the following sanctions may be imposed:

Disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided and interest thereon;
A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;
For officers and directors â a bar from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company;
A criminal fine (regardless of the size of the profit made) of up to $1 million; and
Jail time of up to 10 years. These penalties may apply even if the individual is not a director, officer or senior manager.

137,"The coronavirus lockdown may have led more individuals to become radicalised as they spend more time online, a police chief has warned.

The Metropolitan Police's Lucy D'Orsi said the impact of the lockdown on the terrorism threat was not yet known.

She urged the public to remain alert and vigilant as people return to crowded places closed in March.

The current UK threat level is ""substantial"" meaning an attack is likely.

""The reality is that the threat has not gone away,"" Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner D'Orsi told the BBC.

How coronavirus will change national security
Cyber-spies seek coronavirus vaccine secrets

There are also concerns some of the mechanisms to spot the signs someone has been radicalised will not have been present during the pandemic.

Crowded places have been a prime focus for terrorist attacks in recent years.

As lockdown eases, she is concerned terrorists will be looking to make an impact.

""My plea to the public is as lockdown eases and people return to crowded places, we need to remain alert, we need to remain vigilant,"" DAC D'Orsi, who is also national policing lead for protective security, said.

The threat level comes from individuals supporting far-right as well as jihadist ideologies.

Police have said their own ability to operate has not been affected by lockdown and they have been able to take advantage of the fact that some people under investigation are staying in one place.

But they are also aware that people are spending more time online, which carries risks as that has increasingly been a means of radicalisation.

DAC D'Orsi said what that meant in terms of radicalisation was as yet unknown.

Some terrorist groups have adapted their methods and messaging to the new environment, including using the coronavirus crisis.

""They are looking to change the way they deliver their propaganda,"" she said, adding that propaganda often seeks to divide communities.

Referrals to the Prevent anti-radicalisation scheme, designed to spot and counter signs of radicalisation, have gone down during the pandemic.

That is because many will come from public bodies, including schools, which will have not been operating in the same way.

It leaves the possibility that a problem has been brewing beneath the surface which may now become visible.

Officers said one advantage of lockdown has been that people have undertaken an online counter-terrorism training course from home.

Some 70,000 people have used the 'Action Counters Terrorism' interactive course which is designed for members of the public to help them spot and report suspicious behaviour and know what to do in the event of an attack.

Overall half a million participants have responded to the call since the course was launched two years ago.

""Having more people with a basic level of awareness, and who know what to do if they see suspicious activity, is a real asset to the police,"" DAC D'Orsi said.",nam
138,"TEHRAN â Judiciary Chief Ebrahim Raisi has highlighted the need to fight corruption, saying that whistleblowing without presenting any evidence should not be regarded as part of the countryâs fight against corruption.

âSome people whistle-blow under the guise of fighting corruption without proper evidence, but not every piece of news is correct and it should be investigated beforehand,â Raisi said in remarks on Monday.

âWhistleblowing and revealing corruption is not per se fighting against corruption,â he emphasized.

He also invited people who have evidence about any individualâs corruption to hand out their evidence to the Judiciary.

Under the chairmanship of Ebrahim Raisi, the Judiciary has launched a campaign against financial corruption.

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has permitted the Judiciary to take special measures in order to confront economic corruption and called for âswift and justâ legal action against financial crimes.

The Leader has described the âoutright and unequivocalâ approach toward economic corruption as one of the Judiciaryâs major duties, stressing that confronting the corrupt must be decisive and effective.

Ayatollah Khamenei has also said that the campaign against corruption is at its height and it must continue.

139,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indiaâs fraud-hit PMC Bank has approached other banks over a possible merger even as its efforts to recover funds from a big borrower have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the bankâs administrator said in a court filing seen by Reuters.

Authorities started investigating Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) for fraud last year and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of it after detecting financial irregularities. Thousands of PMC depositors have been unable to access their deposits for a year as the RBI has capped withdrawals at 100,000 rupees ($1,359).

PMC has âtried to engage with the major banks of the country to request for a mergerâ, the bankâs administrator said in a Sept. 10 filing at the Delhi High Court, without identifying the banks or giving other details.

The bulk of PMCâs loan book was found to be disbursed to one Indian real estate company, HDIL, and an RBI-appointed administrator, Jai Bhagwan Bhoria, has been trying to recover the dues in a bid to rescue the lender. Authorities have been investigating officials of both PMC and HDIL.

HDIL and its associates owe 69.81 billion rupees ($949 million) to PMC, but at 11.6 billion rupees ($157.56 million), the realisable value of its securities was âgrossly insufficientâ, Bhoria said in the filing of the case brought forward by two aggrieved PMC depositors.

Other legal processes to sell certain securities have also been hit as courts have not been fully operational during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the filing said.

Bhoria and the RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HDIL, which has denied any wrongdoing, also did not respond.

Set up in 1984, PMC is a regional co-operative lender with 137 branches across six states in India, and its sudden downfall in late September 2019, has left thousands of its depositors struggling.

In his filing, Bhoria said a push to sell an HDIL yacht had also been hit as it was anchored in Sri Lanka and interested bidders had not been able to inspect it due to COVID-19 travel curbs.

Separately, two of HDILâs aircraft could not be auctioned swiftly as the Mumbai International Airport - where they have been parked - was closed to visitors, the filing said.",nam
140,"08 APRIL 2016, Bangkok: Corrupt judicial systems undermine reforms and are a major impediment to ensuring access to justice and human rights for ordinary citizens across the world, says a new report published by the United Nations Development Programme and U4 Anti-corruption Resource Centre on Friday.

Titled, A Transparent and Accountable Judiciary to Deliver Justice for All, the global report cites survey data suggesting that the public perceive the judiciary as the second most corrupt public institution, after the police.

Globally one in four people said they paid a bribe to court officials, according to a 2013 survey by the NGO Transparency International that covered 95 countries. 1 By 2015, TI found that 28% of citizens across Sub-Saharan Africa who had contact with a judge or court official paid a bribe â more than police and any other public sector service. 2

âJudicial corruption disproportionately affects the poorest and most marginalised citizens of a community because they are far less likely to be able to pay a bribe or have access to influential networks,â said Patrick Keuleers, Director, Governance and Peacebuilding at UNDP headquarters.

In Bangladesh, for example, the average bribe of US$108 that a court user has to pay accounts for roughly a quarter of the GDP per capita or average annual income in that country, says the report.

âThe UN system and its partners support numerous initiatives to strengthen judicial systems around the world, and corruption remains a major stumbling block to the success of these efforts,â Keuleers said.

The UNDP report concludes, however, that opening up judicial systems to scrutiny can strengthen integrity and increase public trust without impeding independence of the judiciary.

âWe are advocating the judiciary to open itself to peer learning by engaging with counterparts in other countries and allowing meaningful capacity assessments that will lead to increased judicial integrityâ said Phil Matsheza, Regional Practice Leader in UNDPâs Bangkok Regional Hub.

The report highlights successful experiences from Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Kosovo 3, Nepal, Nigeria, Paraguay, Philippines, and Somalia, in promoting transparency and accountability within the judiciary.

It discusses internal oversight within the judiciary such as judicial councils, and explains the mechanisms used in Somaliland to enforce sanctions against judicial officers in cases of misconduct.

It also looks at how stakeholders such as associations of judges and court users can become allies in reforming judicial systems. For example, the report cites the use of surveys and consultations with court users that have led to more responsive services and reduced demands for bribes in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.

âCorruption undermines justice in many parts of the world with the poor and vulnerable suffering most,â said Cobus de Swardt, Managing Director of the International Secretariat of Transparency International. âThis new report gives critical first-hand answers about promoting integrity in the courts by building citizen and other stakeholdersâ support for reforms and by using technology to increase judicial transparency.â

Even in post-conflict environments such as Afghanistan, where change is difficult, NGOs working with citizens to monitor trials in selected provinces have contributed to improving the administration of justice.

While technology is not offered as a panacea to corruption within justice systems, modernisation and automation of judicial services can be key enablers for judicial transparency and accountability, the report adds. For example, in Indonesia digitising court documents and statistics has helped increase transparency for people who can access judgments online, reduce bureaucracy, and achieve efficiency.

The report stresses that the success of these reforms efforts are predicated on strong political will and national ownership.

The recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes key targets for providing access to justice, and tackling corruption. The report provides a fresh perspective on ways to develop integrity plans as part of broader judicial reforms, by illustrating inspirational experiences that countries can adopt to deliver justice for all.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her new seat on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday to deliver an impassioned argument for campaign finance reform and stronger government ethics laws.

The New York Democrat posed a creative series of questions to ethics experts in an attempt to expose how a corrupt, self-interested lawmaker could avoid accountability in Congress.She called it the ""Corruption Game.""

""Let's play a lightening round game, I'm gonna be the bad guy and I want to get away with as much bad things as possible, ideally to enrich myself and advance my interests, even if that means putting my interests ahead of the American people,"" Ocasio-Cortez began.

She then asked the panel of ethics experts whether she could use ""special interest dark money"" from corporate PACs to fund her theoretical campaign, dole out hush payments to keep adversaries quiet, write laws that benefit her donors, and then buy stocks in companies that would benefit from those laws.

They said she could do all of the above.

Ocasio-Cortez went on, ""Is it possible that any elements of this story apply to our current government and our current public servants?"" she asked.

When the experts responded in the affirmative, Ocasio-Cortez asked whether the ethics regulations pertaining to the president are stricter than those in Congress.

""There's [sic] almost no laws at all that apply to the president,"" said Walter Shaub, the director of the Campaign Legal Center and former head of the US Office of Government Ethics.

""So it's already super legal for me to be a pretty bad guy, but it's even easier for the president of the United States to be one,"" she concluded.

The hearing revolved around sweeping legislation known as HR 1, the ""For the People Act of 2019,"" introduced by House Democrats last month that includes anti-corruption reforms and measures that would make it easier to vote.

The bill also seeks to reduce the influence of big money in elections with a publicly-funded matching system for small-dollar donations to congressional campaigns.

Ocasio-Cortez campaigned heavily on her call to reform campaign finance laws and get big money out of politics. Like a growing number of Democrats, she banned corporate PAC money from he campaign. Around 62% of the $2 million Ocasio-Cortez's campaign raised in the 2018 cycle came from donations of $200 or less, according to Open Secrets.Ocasio-Cortez delivered her questioning after some Republicans on the committee, including the top GOP member Rep. Jim Jordan, criticized HR 1 as a ""wish list for Democrats.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently called the bill a ""power grab"" and the ""Democrat Politician Protection Act.""

McConnell was widely mocked by critics.

Sen. Brian Schatz a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted, ""Voting is a power grab. By citizens.""

143,"MANILA, Philippines â Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Jaime Morente on Wednesday expressed his belief that the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 is âvery oldâ and is in dire need of updating to solve the alleged corrupt activities in the bureau.

âThe Philippine Immigration Act is a very old law, 80 years old to be exact,â Morente said in a statement.

âI have talked to the President and raised this concern to him,â he further stated.

Morente said that since the law was enacted during a time when there were no international flights yet entering and leaving the country, âmany of its provisions are already outdated and inappropriate already.â

The BI chief said updating the law would âanswer salary woes, remove systemic issues, plug loopholes in policies, update fines and penalties, ensure division of power, and confer to the Commissioner the proper disciplinary powers.â

The proposal to revisit the countryâs immigration law was pushed following corruption issues allegedly involving some of the bureauâs personnel.

More than 80 officials and employees of the Immigration bureau are facing investigation and charges before the Office of the Ombudsman over allegations of accepting bribes in exchange for escorting Chinese and other foreign nationals who wish to dodge the immigration screening process in airports.

The scheme was called âpastillas,â named after a local soft milk candy, because the bribe money that some personnel receive are concealed inside rolled up papers resembling the dessert.

According to Morente, they have already implemented measures to address corruption in the bureau.

âThe short-term solution is relieve all those found to have been involved in corrupt practices, hence we relieved all names implicated in the Pastillas issue, and implemented a one strike policy for anyone who tries to follow suit,â he said.

âThe medium-term solution is reorganizing the system,â he added as he revealed that the supervision of the bureauâs Travel Control and Intelligence Unit and the Border Control and Intelligence Unit have been transferred under a different division to âadd layers of checks and balances.â

Morente said the move will âserve as a sort of audit to the actions of those in the Port Operations Division, and dismantles any semblance of a central control of possible illegal activities.â

He, however, stressed that the real and long-term solution is the updating of the Philippine Immigration Act.

âWe can remove people again and again, but the loopholes in the law remain. Quick wins may cure some symptoms in the anti- corruption drive but a responsive new Immigration law may yet cure systemic problems that breed corruption,â he said.

The BI chief earlier lamented that under the existing law, he has no disciplinary powers over his personnel, as âthe power to hire and fire rests with the Secretary of Justice.â

The Immigration bureau is an attached agency of the Department of Justice.

Morente said the proposal to amend the Philippine Immigration law is already in Congress and called for its immediate passage.

âWe thank our lawmakers for the support in our move to modernize the bureau so that once and for all we can rid of systemic issues that remain because of outdated policies,â he said.",nam

Bribes paid by companies to private individuals and money spent to facilitate crimes will no longer be tax-deductible in Switzerland.

The Alpine nation, which has been trying to shed its reputation as a tax haven, said the new rules would go into effect in 2022.

Outside groups have been calling for such reforms for years.

Under Swiss law, bribes to public officials were already denied favourable tax treatment.

The government said the latest update, which has been under discussion for at least five years, ""harmonises"" tax law with its criminal code, which banned private bribery in 2015.

It will also bring it into compliance with recommendations from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Tax crackdown

As of 1996, about half of the countries in the OCED allowed companies to deduct bribes paid to foreign officials from their taxes, including Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. They argued that such practices were routine business expenses in some countries.

But views of such practices have shifted, as international organisations like the OECD push for tougher rules against money laundering and bribery. The OECD has said favourable tax rules help to normalise such practices.

Switzerland changed its tax rules for bribes to public officials in 2001. It made it a criminal offense for a company to bribe a private individual in 2015.

The European Union removed Switzerland from its list of tax havens only last year.

As part of the reforms announced on Wednesday, the government said it would also bar companies from deducting foreign fines from their taxes - except in ""exceptional cases"" if the sanctions ""violate Swiss public policy or if a company credibly demonstrates that it has taken all reasonable steps to comply with the law"".",nam
145,"The Chairman of the Iranian parliament's influential Commission for National Security and Foreign Policy, Mojtaba Zonnour, said that President Hassan Rouhani deserves to be executed a thousand times a day, and that the Iranian people would agree with his views.

In a tweet on Friday, Zonnour wrote, ""The Rt. Hon. Rouhani; if you are justifying negotiations with the enemy by arguing that Imam Hassan reached a peaceful agreement with Mu'awiyah to respect the majority of people's demand; the overwhelming majority of the Iranian people today will not be satisfied with less than your dismissal, and the Supreme Leader of the Revolution should order to execute you one thousand times.""

Shi'ites' second Imam, Hasan ibn Ali (624-670 CE), was elected for the caliphate after his father's death, but abdicated after six or seven months in favor of his opponent Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty.

In a speech on October 14, Rouhani had referred to the events of the advent of Islam, insisting that Imam Hassan made peace with Mu'awiyah because ""the overwhelming majority of society and people"" wanted peace.

Rouhani's critics immediately described the remarks as a prelude to his willingness to negotiate with the United States.

Zonnour criticized Rouhani for the remarks, adding that if ""we were to act according to most people's opinion,"" Rouhani should be condemned to death because the majority of people are dissatisfied with his performance.

Another fundamentalist member of the Majlis Islamic parliament, Mojtaba Rezakhah, also tweeted that Rouhani had misinterpreted Islamic history.

Rezakhah went further by saying that Rouhani had also earlier used another Islamic event -- the martyrdom of Shi'ites' third Imam, and Hassan's younger brother, Hussain ibn Ali -- to lift the sanctions on Iran.

The sanctions not only remained intact, Rezakhah argued, but the value of the Iranian national currency, the rial, dropped tenfold against the dollar.

An influential Friday Prayer Imam, Ahmad Alam ol-Hoda of the city of Mashhad, in northeast Iran, also asserted that Imam Hassan's peace agreement with Mu'awiyah had nothing to do with the people's demands.

""The 'insiders' and 'people accomodating to the enemy' betrayed the Shi'ites' second Imam,"" Alam ol-Hoda added.

Comparing and linking Iranian-U.S negotiations with Imam Hassan's peace accord with Mu'awiyah have a long history in Iranian political literature.

Last May, after the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted in Persian about ""Imam Hassan"" and called him ""the bravest personality in the history of Islam,"" there was much speculation whether the tweet was paving the way for negotiating with the United States.

Responding to the speculations, a news website linked to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, Tasnim, said that according to Khamenei, since Iranian society was unaware of the facts and Imam Hassan's close allies and insiders were treacherous, he was ""forced"" to come to terms with Mu'awiyah.

""Ayatollah Khamenei does not consider Iran's current situation similar to the period Imam Hassan made peace with Mu'awiyah,"" Tasnim reiterated.

In a speech in early July 2015, Rouhani also invoked the historic peace made in the year 661 by his namesake, Imam Hassan, to step down in favor of Mu'awiyah and prevent a new war between the then-emerging Sunni and Shiite sects. ""Imam Hassan made an important decision during difficult circumstances that could have destroyed the Muslim community,"" Rouhani said, praising Imam's decision as ""heroic flexibility.""

Following his words, fundamentalists and close allies of Khamenei blasted Rouhani with a barrage of criticism.

Nevertheless, days later on July 14, 2015, with the approval of Khamenei, Iran joined with other world powers to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement.

However, with President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, Rouhani's critics have asserted that the current situation could not be compared with Imam Hassan's time, about 1400 years ago.

In its editorial last Thursday, the fundamentalist daily Resalat referred to the same argument, writing that Rouhani neither understands politics nor religion.",nam
146,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Weâve just had the closest look yet at the global battle against money laundering, and itâs deeply troubling: Banks and their regulators are nowhere near restraining the flow of trillions of dollars of illicit funds.

Both the finance industry and the authorities are to blame. Without an urgent, concerted political effort, criminals â from drug dealers and terrorists to human traffickers â will keep the upper hand.

In a year-long investigation by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, reporters pored over about 2,100 suspicious activity reports, or SARs, which lenders file to the U.S. Treasuryâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when they spot potential money laundering and other bad behavior.

While the number of SARs reviewed by the journalists dwarfs any previous access to these confidential documents, theyâre still just a tiny fraction â 0.02% â of the 12 million or so SARs that were probably filed during the period in question, mostly 2011 through 2017. Also, the sample isnât representative of overall banking activity. Some records stem from the U.S. congressional investigation into interference with the 2016 presidential election. Almost half of the SARs came from Deutsche Bank AG.

Still, the sums and the patterns of failings are staggering. This small number of reports alone flagged up $2 trillion of fund flows, $1.3 trillion from Deutsche Bank, that may have stemmed from criminal activity. And the FinCEN Files are just the tip of the iceberg, as Transparency International put it. (The banksâ responses to BuzzFeed are here.)

The U.K., home to more than 600 companies flagged in the reports, appears to be the biggest hub for dodgy money flows, with the U.S. second. Britain clearly hasnât done enough to tighten laws against money launderers. A huge web of enablers, from lawyers to accountants and bankers, helps oil the wheels of illicit finance through London.

Banks, for their part, are too slow if not outright negligent in submitting SARs. More than a fifth of the documents included in the submissions related to subjects whose addresses werenât known to the banks, including companies with whom the lenders were already banking.

SARs, which should be filed within 60 days of detecting potential criminal activity, were sometimes submitted years later. According to the BuzzFeed/ICIJ report, that was allegedly the case with JPMorgan Chase & Co., which processed payments for Paul Manafort, President Donald Trumpâs former campaign manager, after he resigned from the 2016 campaign amid money-laundering allegations. HSBC Holdings Plc kept moving money for an investment fund that was already under investigation over allegations it was a Ponzi scheme, the report says.

Alarmingly, banks often just rely on internet searches to find out who their clients are and only file suspicious reports after news breaks or formal investigations are launched. In the bundle of SARs reviewed by the reporters, the median filing time since the suspicious activity began was 166 days. Imagine how far those funds would have gone in half a year.

The reviewed SARs pertain to a period when many banks were already being investigated and punished for failing to adhere to money-laundering regulation. But the billions of dollars in fines levied against them havenât changed behavior much.

Having a bigger legal stick with which to whack errant bankers and other enablers would help. So too would a rethink of how money laundering is tackled by policy makers. Police forces and national regulators donât only struggle to cooperate across borders; even within some crime agencies, various units donât always share information.

Tom Kirchmaier, a policing and crime researcher at the London School of Economics, suggests a three-step solution. For starters, the SARs filings must be standardized. Far too much information is submitted in narratives that are impossible to scrutinize. FinCEN employs about 270 employees, receiving up to 2 million SARs every year. âWeâre still stuck in the 19th century,â Switzerlandâs former top money-laundering cop Daniel Thelesklaf says of his nationâs paper-based efforts.

Second, Kirchmaier calls for far more sharing of data between regulators and enforcers. In Europe, more than 50 authorities supervise money laundering and terror financing. The European Commission will propose an EU-level supervisor next year. Thatâs long overdue.

Lastly, Kirchmaier says humans need to be removed from the process as far as possible. Crime agencies should be able to automate the screening of SARs and report back to banks, providing them with an assessment of the risk associated with a particular client, for example. And lenders ought to be able to stop transactions to flagged entities without so much human intervention.

A radical improvement in the fight against money laundering may not be possible overnight, but â as Iâve written before â the system isnât working. As the speed of payments accelerates and virtual currencies proliferate, criminals will find new ways to move money. Banks and their supervisors collectively need to do much, much better.

148,"Corruption has severe damaging effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important priorities such as health, education, and infrastructure. As stated by former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, on the passage of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption:

Corruption is an insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets, erodes the quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.

Essentially, if left unchecked, corruption becomes more than just an economic or international development issue, it begins to threaten basic human rights.

One of the primary ways corruption manifests is through bribery and improper uses of official funds. And despite the damage such crimes cause to global development, there are few mechanisms preventing corruption on a cross-boundary or international scale. For example, Transparency Internationalâs new report, Exporting Corruption, found that only 11 major exporting countries â accounting for about a third of world exports â have active or moderate law enforcement against companies bribing abroad in order to gain mining rights, contracts for major construction projects, purchases of planes, and other deals. At the same time, perceptions of corruption have plateaued and even risen in many states in recent years. Additionally, according to the European Commission, global offshore wealth rose to an estimated EUR 7.5 trillion (USD 7.8 trillion) or 10.4% of the global GDP for 2016 alone, which (in an effort to calculate the scale of international tax evasion), for just the EU meant that an estimated EUR 46 billion in revenue was lost to international tax evasion for the same year.

Based on a review of existing national and regional legislation, the only law truly effectively deterring such violations on a larger scale appears to be the United Statesâ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). The FCPA, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1977, was intended to stop corrupt practices wherever they arise, create a level playing field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace. As stated by U.S. Senator Tower in a 1976 Senate Floor Hearing leading up to the passage of the FCPA:

[I]mproper payments to foreign government officials or their intermediaries is indeed a serious problem and one which is not taken lightly by responsible governments. It is also a problem more akin to a disease which deeply troubles proponents of our free enterprise system. We have built an economy in the United States based on vigorous, honest competition where price, quality, and service commingle with demand and supply to regulate economic transactions. Bribery poisons this system by destroying the organisms of mutual trust and voluntary cooperation so essential to the free flow of commerce. This ethical decay must be stopped.

To do so, the FCPA prohibits the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order to obtain a business advantage and requires publicly traded corporations to have certain internal controls in place and make and keep books and records that accurately reflect the transactions of the corporation in order to ensure that funds are used properly and not for any illicit purpose. Because the FCPA applies to both U.S. persons (including U.S. corporations, NYSE corporations, or corporations trading specific types of ADRs acting abroad) and foreign nationals as well as violations that use U.S. mechanisms or occur in part in the United States, the FCPA uniquely stretches to reach international conduct and prevents just the sort of cross-border violations that often stunt international development. U.S. persons, including corporations, cannot simply go abroad to engage in corrupt activities and take advantage of gaps in other countriesâ enforcement of bribery and related misconduct.

Additionally, the FCPA is extremely effective in preventing corruption because (1) it has strong sanctions deterring wrongdoing, and (2) whistleblowers from around the world can safely report violations of its provisions under the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) whistleblower program.

First, unlike many other laws that prevent corruption, the FCPA has substantial sanctions for wrongdoers. For each violation of the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA provides that companies may be subject to a fine of up to $2 million USD and individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, may be fined of up to $250,000 and for each violation of its internal controls/recording keeping provisions. In total, the FCPA provides that corporations may be fined up to $25 million USD and individuals may be fined of up to $5 million USD. Violations of either provision may also result in jail time for individuals. Moreover, under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3571(d), courts can actually impose significantly higher fines, namely, up to twice the benefit that the defendant obtained by making the corrupt payment, and under 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78u-2 the SEC may order the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from FCPA violators, often resulting in massive overall sanctions. For example, to date in 2020, the average sanction for entities for FCPA violations is $293,824,428 USD. These fines, which are largely nominal in other nations, significantly deter corporate corruption. For example, in France, the company Vitol was fined â¬300,000 for the same international bribery scheme that it was fined $17 million for in the United States.

Second, the FCPA is under the joint jurisdiction of the SEC and Department of Justice, which means that whistleblowers may report violations of the FCPA to the SEC under the SECâs comprehensive and extremely successful whistleblower program. Corruption, particularly corruption transcending national boundaries, is extremely difficult to detect or prove, particularly when law enforcement is often limited to U.S.-based evidence. Therefore, in order to detect and prove legal violations such as those covered under the FCPA, it is vital to encourage whistleblowers to come forward. Whistleblowers (who are typically âinsidersâ) are uniquely positioned to bring corruption taking place primarily outside of the U.S. to the attention of U.S. law enforcement. They are also often best positioned to track how a fraud crosses international borders. Lastly, whistleblowers may be exclusively able to access and send evidence of U.S. personsâ wrongdoing occurring abroad to U.S. officials largely stuck in the United States.

It is important to note that this program is mutually beneficial to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are able to submit anonymous tips through to the SEC through attorneys using the SECâs Form TCR program. If their tips then lead to sanctions over $1 million USD, they may be entitled to between 10 and 30 percent of the monies recovered depending on a variety of factors. Because, as discussed above, the FCPA was designed to combat the âethical decay of corruption,â FCPA whistleblowers are not only protected by the strict confidentiality and anonymity provisions of the SEC whistleblower program, but may be handsomely compensated for their risk in exposing corruption due to the high sanctions violators often face and the extremely high law enforcement interest of U.S. officials in preventing bribery and associated illegal activities, one of the factors for increasing a whistleblower reward. Arguably, law enforcement interest is the sole motivating factor for the FCPA and therefore, all whistleblowers who provide information that leads to a sanction of $1 million dollars or more should receive the maximum award.

In order to prevent erosion of democratic institutions around the world, the FCPA should be replicated in other nations, particularly in the global north, where wrongdoers are more likely to try and âgameâ the international system. The United States cannot tackle this issue alone. Additionally, whistleblowers must be encouraged and lauded in the United States and elsewhere so that insiders continue to bravely expose corruption only they can see and track. FCPA whistleblowers have been, and continue to be, vital to ensuring that those who commit fraud face prosecution in the United States and have their ill-gotten gains disgorged. Each successful FCPA case makes it more likely that a would-be fraudster in any part of the world thinks twice before committing bribery and other malfeasance, for fear of legal repercussions brought by the might of the United States government.

150,"India does not need a revolution or other radical measures to subdue the monster of corruption. Even marginal changes to the existing laws can unleash lasting improvements to governance.

The recent expose of massive corruption in government has made people wonder whether crookedness is a typical Indian trait. The national mood is sullen, cynical and despondent. Are Indians are incorrigibly venal? Is dishonesty embedded in our DNA? Are our brains wired to corruption?

The all-pervasive despair is unwarranted. India is not destined to live with corruption. Indian politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats are only as honest or crooked as their counterparts across the world, including the West.

Why then is corruption rampant in India? The hullabaloo over the recent scams has diverted public attention from the causes of corruption. Let us examine one of the little talked about causes â the complexity of our laws.

Law-making is still being held hostage to the colonial mindset of command and control. Indian laws are typically known for their complexity, obtuseness and ambiguity. Lack of clarity and transparency makes our laws fertile breeding grounds for corruption because the bureaucracy has arrogated to itself the powers to interpret laws at their discretion.

It will not be an exaggeration to say that it is virtually impossible to be entirely honest to survive in business or access services from the government. We enact tough laws which everybody knows are difficult to observe in letter and in spirit.

Anybody setting up a new business or factory has to comply with a plethora of statutory requirements. It is not argued here that regulations are bad. But the rules should not be so unrealistically stringent as to make compliance impossible. It appears that the purpose of regulation is not to enforce responsible behaviour among people and protect society but to provide an avenue for corrupt officials to make easy money. It seems that strict laws are made not be observed but to be paid lip service with the connivance of corrupt officials. For instance, many cracker units are allowed to function in unsafe conditions. There is no dearth of laws to regulate these units. But who cares whether these units comply with the laws so long as money changes hands.

The statute book is littered with obsolete laws which have outlived their utility. They are allowed to continue only as a source of corruption. Road contractors have to bid at low rates because the official rates are not periodically revised in accordance with inflation. The contractor tries to make a profit by tampering with the quality and quantity of materials. All these are done with the connivance of officials.

Sometimes, absence of any law helps corrupt politicians enrich themselves at the expense of the exchequer. The absence of a transparent policy for allocating spectrum and coal blocks led to a massive loss of revenue for the government.

Drafting of laws often involves subterfuge. For instance, people with criminal backgrounds are able to contest elections and enter legislative bodies because the law states that they must have been convicted to be prevented from entering the fray. This provision has been deliberately inserted with the knowledge that criminal trials normally take a decade or two to be completed. The ostensible justification for this ridiculous law is that frivolous litigation could be used to prevent politicians from contesting. The law could have stated that any criminal case pending for more than say six years would trigger disqualification.

Our State governments continue with the old paper-based administration, leading to opaqueness in the functioning of departments. The success of the passenger reservation system of the Railways is testimony to the fact that electronic interface between the public and the government is a sure recipe for reducing corruption.

All routine decisions except those relating to national security should be put on websites on a real-time basis. A shift to total e-governance is long overdue.

India does not need a revolution or other radical measures to subdue the monster of corruption. Even marginal changes to the existing laws can catalyse and unleash lasting improvements to governance. The numerous reports of the Law Commission and the Administrative Reforms Commission gathering dust in the corridors of power should be retrieved, re-examined and their well-intentioned recommendations implemented.

The challenge before the people is how to make the political class realise that the old order must change yielding place to the new.",nam
151,"Pope Francis is preparing to ramp up his fight against corruption in the Vatican, he said in an interview on Friday, weeks after the shock ousting of a cardinal over embezzlement accusations.

""I have had to change many things, and many more will soon change,"" the Argentine pontiff told Italy's Adnkronos news agency when asked about his anti-corruption strategy.

Pope Francis, elected in 2013 on a mandate of cleaning up after a series of scandals in the centuries-old institution, has reformed laws and fired top financial officials to bring the Vatican into line with international standards on transparency and money laundering.

In September, the 83-year old forced the resignation of Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a close adviser who has been accused of syphoning off funds destined for the poor to family members -- a charge he denies.

The pope's reforms have met fierce opposition, particularly among the Church's old guard.

Francis said in the interview that he had been warned years ago that if he ever became pope he should get a dog, and make sure it tasted all of his food -- and survived -- before eating it himself.

""Am I reckless? A bit careless? I wouldn't know,"" he said. ""I don't fear consequences against me. I'm not afraid of anything.""

The Vatican has been dogged by scandals in recent years, including the 2017 conviction of the ex-head of a Vatican-run hospital for funnelling a fortune from a foundation to renovate a cardinal's apartment.

And the Vatican bank, known as the IOR, was for decades embroiled in controversies, with one of its former presidents ordered to stand trial on charges of embezzlement and money laundering in 2018.",nam
152,"The government is planning to introduce a new law to force all businesses to assess their risk of a terrorist attack and take measures to cope with the threat.

Details of the new legislation emerged at the inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing, where Shaun Hipgrave - from the government's Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) - was giving evidence.

Mr Hipgrave, who is part of the Home Office, acknowledged the legislation would have ""such an impact on this country that we want to get it right"".

It appears to be designed to echo health and safety legislation by putting a duty on businesses and local authorities to take into account the risk of terrorism and to train their staff to deal with that risk.

The police only have 200 counter-terrorism security advisers across the whole country and the legislation is expected to affect up to 650,000 venues.

To cope with the demand, the government is already developing an online ""platform"" to help firms understand the risk.

The move is supported by some of the families of the victims of the Manchester attack in May 2017 - which killed 22 people - particularly Figen Murray, who is seeking to introduce legislation dubbed Martyn's law after her son Martyn Hett died in the atrocity.

Mr Hipgrave said the government would apply the legislation to ""publicly accessible locations"" from small venues with 30 customers right up to the O2 Arena in London, but insisted there would be ""proportionality"".

The areas include sectors such as health, education, retail and leisure; faith groups and LGBT groups; public spaces, towns, villages, and ""grey space""; and large venues similar to the Manchester Arena.

Mr Hipgrave said the purpose of the laws were to ""ensure there are no gaps where there are areas where the public have access and someone can say I wasn't accountable.

""Someone is accountable in all those areas, and by accountable, I mean accountable for the security of the public in all those locations.

""If anyone leaves their home and walks down the street, drops their children off at nursery, goes to shops or the cinema, the public wouldn't know it, but someone is responsible for their protection because they are in a publicly accessible location.""

""No view"" has been reached on whether breaching the legislation would be a criminal or civil offence, or how inspection and enforcement would work, he added.

Ministers have given their approval and consultation was supposed to open in September, but it has been delayed by the second coronavirus lockdown in England, because many of those who will be affected have been furloughed, Mr Hipgrave said.

He also said the new legislation was the ""only credible answer that will have the impact that ministers expect and ministers intend.""",nam
153,"A Japanese company has developed an artificial intelligence-powered automated teller machine to prevent fraudulent money transfers, the first of its kind in the country.

The system, which can recognise the appearance and movement of ATM users through an embedded camera, aims to help prevent crimes in which scammers guide elderly victims over the phone to transfer money by making them believe they will be refunded a higher amount.

Despite repeated warnings by authorities and other entities, financial losses related to so-called refund money wiring fraud remain high in Japan, totalling about 1.07 billion yen (US$9.5 million) in the first half of 2018, according to the National Police Agency.

If the AI recognises a user talking over the phone during a money transfer, the screen displays a warning to stop the transaction. The ATM will also ask users to take off any masks or sunglasses, and if they do not follow the instructions, the transaction will be cancelled automatically.

The AI system was designed to memorise a huge number of images based on the âdeep learningâ method, and boasts a highly precise detection technique, according to Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions Corp., which aims to commercialise the system in the next financial year starting in April.

In resource rich, commodity-dependent developing nations such as Chile, the issue of trade misinvoicing is not only highly prevalent, but of great negative consequence for public welfare.

Chile ranks on the higher end of the GDP per capita and Human Development Index spectrum of Latin America, though it is still considered a developing country by the International Monetary Fund. And despite low levels of corruption in Chile, trade misinvoicing still occurs.

Trade misinvoicing occurs when individuals or companies intentionally falsify export and/or import invoices, with the ultimate goals ranging from tax evasion to trade-based money laundering.

Several underlying characteristics of the commodity trade in developing countriesâunder-staffed and under-resourced customs departments, lack of proper and sufficient oversight, coupled with state-ownership of many extractive companies and the complex influence of international trade partners â invite opportunities for trade misinvoicing as well as rent-seeking by public officials.

In Chile, these conditions play out in the nationâs dominant industry: the copper business. The Chilean Copper Commission reported that in 2018, copper constituted 48.2% of Chileâs total exports, with the larger, umbrella category of minerals totaling 55.8% and US$42.1 billion. The economic importance and susceptibility of Chileâs most crucial natural resource industry to misinvoicing urges scrutiny.

As disclosed in Global Financial Integrityâs report, âTrade-Related Illicit Financial Flows in 135 Developing Countries: 2008-2017,â Chile clocked in with a $14.5 billion value gap in trade with all global partners in 2017. GFI calculates this value gap, or the difference between values of imports and exports between partner nations, through analysis of each countryâs reported trade data. This means there is $14.5 billion unaccounted for in trade records between Chile and its partners.

Other studies have pointed specifically to the vulnerability of the copper industry. A 2016 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) publication concluded that there was widespread copper export overinvoicing in Chile, particularly with some of its largest trade partners such as Japan, China, and the Netherlands.

A subsequent case study of the same industry published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) showed chronic export underinvoicing, especially in trade with China. The difficulty pinpointing the direction of misinvoicing from national data and the consequent contradictions in reports is why GFI uses the value gap terminology, which takes only the absolute difference. Nonetheless, there are certainly irregularities in Chileâs trade, as the table below shows.

The ECLAC linked the majority of the export underinvoicing in their study to a deal between Chileâs state-owned copper corporation, CODELCO, and a state-owned Chinese metal and mineral company, China Minmetals Corporation. In 2006, in return for a Minmetals investment of $550 million in the development of the Gaby mine in northern Chile, CODELCO agreed to supply Minmetals with copper for 15 years at a rate below the market copper price.

But in 2016, questioning of CODELCO by the Chilean tax authority on issues of tax evasion and structure caused CODELCO to pull out of Copper Partners Investment Ltd., the Bermuda-located joint venture created between CODELCO and Minmetals. Concerns arose about the nature of the CODELCO and Minmetals deal, chiefly regarding the motivations behind selling to a foreign company at such a loss to Chile.

Foreign investors like Minmetals were taxed at a rate of 35% to 42% under Chileâs Decreto Ley 600 of 1974, while state-owned companies such as CODELCO paid additional public entity taxes. Therefore, there were many potential incentives for domestic companies to underinvoice their exports and set up tax-haven ventures with foreign investors that could be used to facilitate transfer pricing.

The CODELCO-Minmetals situation is far from explicitly suspicious, but it both introduces the level of skepticism needed in examining Chileâs copper industry and illuminates the complexity of trade misinvoicing as a tool for facilitating illicit financial flows. Other cases in Chile, like a recent one in which 83 tons of stolen copper cable would have been exported to China with falsified invoices, emphasize these points.

Additional cases and scandals encompass the intricacies of trade and misinvoicing in Chile. Past presidential candidate Marco EnrÃ­quez-Ominami and ex-advisor CristiÃ¡n Wagner were accused of falsifying invoices in conjunction with the high-profile, international OAS company scandal; the Milicogate embezzlement case in which Chilean military officers were investigated for allegedly falsifying invoices totaling $200 million and implicating domestic, Israeli, and US companies, made all the more complicated by the funding of the military by state-owned copper; and even cases of distributors smuggling or falsifying invoices to get cigarettes into and out of Chile while evading taxes totaling up to$57 million, emphasize that tax evasion is a big motivator behind illicit trade.

Smaller criminal cases show that trade-based money laundering in Chile often is used to obscure drug trafficking: in Caso Pilar del Norte, a fruit import/export business was allegedly used to launder drug proceeds between Mexico and Chile; similarly, in Caso Yaupel, a fruit importer and distributor reportedly laundered money digitally between Colombia, Germany, Ecuador and Chile. In a related case, Caso el Hermano de Yaupel, the importerâs brother expanded the trade-based money laundering scheme into Hungary, Panama, and the Netherlands. Other cases range from embezzlement, human trafficking and the drug trade across Latin America and other global partners.

Manuel Melero, President of Chileâs National Chamber of Commerce, said âas an Observatory of Illicit Commerce we are deeply concerned with the effects of the organized crime that is behind smuggling and counterfeiting.â

As these cases illustrate, the issue of trade misinvoicing in Chile is not simply a matter of lost revenue, but a matter of governance, transnational security, and public welfare.",am

The UNDP Seoul Policy Centre for Global Development Partnerships (USPC), in partnership with the UNDP Vietnam Country Office, the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) of the Republic of Korea, and the Government Inspectorate of Vietnam, organized a three-day workshop in Hanoi, in December last year to share with Vietnam the ACRCâs Anti-Corruption Initiative Assessment (AIA) tool and experiences.

The AIA is an annual exercise for corruption prevention in the Republic of Korea since 2002 and now covers more than 250 public institutions. It assesses the effectiveness of Korean public sector organizations in implementing the governmentâs anti-corruption policies and initiatives. Every year, all assessment scores are publicized and organizations are ranked. As such the AIA is a motivational tool for the heads of public institutions to put in place and improve institutional measures that prevent corruption.

The workshop marked the first major activity of a joint UNDP-ACRC pilot project, supported by USPC and the UNDP Global Anti-Corruption Initiative (GAIN), which aims to increase Vietnamâs capacity, efficacy, and political will to monitor institutional measures for corruption prevention in the public sector. The project utilizes a triangular development cooperation modality involving UNDP, Korea, and Vietnam, with USPC and UNDP Vietnam as a âtranslatorâ and facilitator of knowledge sharing and application of Koreaâs approaches to anti-corruption.

Anti-Corruption in recent years has become a key policy priority in the Government of Vietnam, and the Government Inspectorate issued a new law to assess the countryâs corruption situation and monitor anti-corruption work in the Government and the public sector. In this context, Koreaâs AIA was identified as a useful reference point to improve the effectiveness of these efforts.

The AIA was shared in an interactive format with some 60 Vietnamese government officials through a combination of peer-to-peer discussions and Q&A sessions with the Government Inspectorate Taskforce, as well as a larger workshop that was chaired by the Deputy General Inspector of Vietnam (Vice-Minister level) and attended by key stakeholders, including from several provinces.

âEffective corruption prevention is becoming more important than ever in Korea and elsewhere around the world. And prevention pays offâthis is the underlying message from Koreaâs experience,â said the Vice Chairperson of the ACRC in her opening speech delivered through a video message.

The Director and Deputy Director of ACRCâs Survey and Evaluation Division delivered technical presentations on the AIA methodology, using a 100-page Guidance Note that had been translated and shared in advance with the Vietnamese counterparts. Vietnamâs government partners also presented their existing anti-corruption efforts and instruments in a comparative context, as well as a draft action plan with their ideas to apply the AIA approach to the Vietnamese context in the near future.

The pilot project is part of USPCâs Development Solutions Partnerships (DSPs), which is an approach for USPC, initiated in 2014, to act as a knowledge broker and facilitator to connect Korea with the wider UNDP network and enhance the Korea-UNDP partnership on strategic development issues. Anti-corruption is one of the key areas of USPCâs current work.",nam
157,"IN 2014 UKRAINIANS got so fed up with the grotesque corruption of their political class that they staged a revolution. Since then, reformers have been trying to build institutions to hold the countryâs oligarchs and crooked politicians to account. One big victory was establishing an electronic asset-declaration system, an online registry where officials must list all of their main possessions. But on October 27th Ukraineâs constitutional court found a clever way to cripple this system: it struck down the anti-corruption authoritiesâ power to punish anyone for lying on it.

Piquantly, four of the courtâs 18 justices were being investigated by those same authorities. After the ruling, Schemes, an investigative news outfit, reported that the chief judge had failed to declare property he owns in Russian-occupied Crimea, acquired under Russian law, which would imply recognising Russian sovereignty. In his defence, he said he did not know how to file an e-declaration for land in Crimea.

It has been 18 months since Volodymyr Zelensky went from playing Ukraineâs president on television to being elected president in real life. He now faces a test of his pledge to clean up the country. Bit by bit, the countryâs top court is dismantling the anti-corruption infrastructure. In August it partially struck down the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and ruled that its head had been appointed illegally. The new ruling strips the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) of much of its power.

Fighting graft is not just a domestic concern. Ukraineâs economic stability is bolstered by a $5bn loan secured in June from the IMF. It stands to get another â¬1.2bn ($1.4bn) in economic and covid-19 aid from the EU (as well as continuing to enjoy visa-free travel in it). Both organisations make their assistance conditional on fighting corruption. On November 3rd the EU warned that both aid and visa-free travel could be jeopardised. It says it will first wait to see whether Ukraine restores power to the anti-corruption bodies.

Reformers are divided over how to do this. Mr Zelensky, trying to rally popular support after his party did badly in municipal elections last month, has urgently demanded that parliament pass legislation firing all of the constitutional courtâs judges. It is not clear that he has the votes. Even if he does, legal experts say the move would itself be unconstitutional. Another proposal is to pass new laws re-establishing the anti-corruption agencies on firmer ground. But activists, who suspect the court of being corrupt and compromised by pro-Russian interests, fear it will find an excuse to strike down those new laws too. In the short term the court has been slowed by four liberal judges who are refusing to attend, denying it a quorum. Some propose raising the quorum requirement, making it easy for a few reformers to block action.

Those who dislike the clean-up efforts may next attack laws that have let dodgy banks (owned by oligarchs) be nationalised, and a new law opening up the land market. The Anti-corruption Action Centre (AntAC), the countryâs premier watchdog, says such legal challenges are a stubborn effort to re-establish the sort of kleptocratic order that existed under Viktor Yanukovych, a disgraced ex-president, and to sabotage Ukraineâs turn towards the West. The constitutional court is âthe most protected organ in the country,â says Olena Shcherban, AntACâs chief legal expert. If Mr Zelensky wants to salvage his presidency, he will have to take it on.

158,"The Coalitionâs commonwealth integrity commission will not conduct public hearings or release reports into alleged corruption by public servants and politicians, the attorney general has confirmed.

Releasing two bills to establish the anti-corruption body on Monday, Christian Porter revealed the government would create new corruption offences and argued guilty public officials should be tried in court rather than have their careers âdestroyedâ by integrity commissions.

Despite announcing a six-month period of consultation, Porter warned opposition and crossbench parties there were âcertain matters of principleâ the government would not compromise on.

The proposed commission would consist of a law enforcement integrity division to oversee the department of home affairs, federal police, and other law enforcement and regulatory bodies; and a public sector division to oversee federal departments and agencies, higher education bodies, MPs and their staff. The oversight of judges could be added to the public sector division.

The law enforcement integrity division could investigate corruption of any kind, would have the discretion to hold public hearings and could initiate investigations after referrals from the public.

Related: Coalition blasted after blaming Covid for delay in creating federal anti-corruption body

By contrast, the public sector division would only consider referrals from other agencies and regulators, could not hold public hearings and would be limited to investigating corruption that breached criminal offences.

The integrity commission would have the power to investigate fresh matters on its own motion only where something was revealed in the course of an existing investigation.

Laborâs shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, declared on Monday that the proposed commission was âweak, secretive and compromisedâ, signalling Labor was prepared to block it.

Porter told reporters in Canberra the rationale for allowing public hearings on law enforcement was âthere is a higher risk and a much greater threat from corruption inside law enforcement agencies in so far as they are the agencies that are meant to enforce the lawâ.

The attorney general said he would hate to see âdeadlockâ develop if crossbench parties insisted on full public hearings and warned that the government would listen to feedback but âstick stronglyâ to its position against public hearings.

Porter defended the higher bar to investigate public servants and politicians, noting the list of possible crimes that could spark an investigation was âvery longâ â at 143 offences.

âIn my observation, they cover every conceivable type of serious criminal conduct that one might label corruption,â he said.

New offences will include repeated public sector corruption and concealing public sector corruption. But many seek to punish those that raise unmeritorious complaints, including disclosure of false or misleading allegations to a commonwealth investigative body and raising public sector corruption issues with no basis and with an intention to cause detriment.

Porter accepted that the jurisdiction to investigate law enforcement might be slightly broader, but countered that for a public service of hundreds of thousands of people it was beneficial to create âclarity as to what conduct is criminally corrupt, and what conduct might be misconduct of a lower standardâ.

From 1 January, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity will expand its jurisdiction to cover four tax, investment, prudential regulation and competition regulators, before morphing to become the law enforcement division of the new commission.

The government has committed $106.7m in new funding to establish the commission on top of $40.7m of existing ACLEI funding.

Porter would not be drawn on timing for the public sector integrity division, arguing it depended on when legislation passed parliament. He noted he needed to convince the crossbench the proposal was âthe best-balanced approachâ to create the anti-corruption agency.

Crossbench MPs and senators such as independent MP Helen Haines prefer a stronger model with public referrals and public hearings â which transparency advocates say deter corrupt conduct.

Porter said blocking public hearings was necessary to avoid the âpitfallsâ of state anti-corruption bodies that deny procedural fairness to witnesses and cause âinnocent people [to] suffer unfairlyâ.

Despite limitations on public hearings and jurisdiction, Porter boasted the commission would have âgreater investigatory powersâ than a royal commission including the ability to compel evidence, search and seize evidence under warrant, arrest people and tap phones.

Cases from the public sector division would be referred to commonwealth prosecutors âfor public trial and conviction or acquittal depending on how that trial transpiredâ, he said.

The Coalition first promised a national integrity commission in December 2018, at which time Scott Morrison revealed it had been in the works since January 2018.

Continuing the governmentâs practice of blaming the Covid-19 pandemic for delay, Porter said although he had draft legislation in December 2019 it would have been âa terrible ideaâ to conduct consultation on 400 pages of legislation âduring the height of a pandemicâ.

Porter rejected the view that there was some âurgencyâ to improving scrutiny of politicians, arguing there were already 11 agencies with jurisdiction over criminal conduct and corruption in the public sector.

Porter said the commonwealth integrity commission could investigate conduct before it came into existence provided the conduct was an offence at the time.

He said full retrospectivity â proposed by the Greens and backed by Labor â was âwrong ethically, morally and in principleâ.

Dreyfus told reporters in Melbourne that if Australians have to âwait for the election of a Labor governmentâ to get a proper integrity commission then âso be itâ.

âIf this government manages to persuade crossbench members of the Senate that they should favour its inadequate model, then a future Labor government will certainly commit to giving Australia the proper integrity commission,â he said.",nam

162,"Payments firm Afterpay can move on with its life as it has been cleared by the Australian regulator over compliance issues with anti-money laundering (AML) rules.

It was back in June 2019 when Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ordered the appointment of an external auditor to the Tencent-backed firm to examine its compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) Act 2006.

AUSTRAC had identified concerns with the buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm â such as identification and verification of customers; and suspicious matter reporting obligations.

In November last year an independent audit found that the issues arose because Afterpay breached AML laws due to incorrect legal advice about how to comply.

Today (14 October) the regulator says in response to the findings and recommendations identified in the external audit report, Afterpay has âupliftedâ its AML/CTF compliance framework and financial crime function, and completed all remediation necessary to ensure compliance.

AUSTRAC has âdecided not to undertake further regulatory actionâ.

But it will continue to work with the Melbourne-based company to ensure its obligations, etc.

This good news for Afterpay follows the positive development in August when it entered into an agreement with NBQ to acquire Pagantis and PMT Technology for â¬50 million. That gave it a real boost for its European fintech ambitions.

Prior to that, Tencent grabbed a $193.3 million stake in Afterpay. Tencent, famous for its communications platforms Weixin, WeChat and QQ, got a 5% stake.

Afterpay launched in 2015 and like Klarna â another healthy BNPL firm â is doing well. Last month the Australian paytech had a market capitalisation on the ASX of around AU$22 billion ($16 billion).",nam
163,"NEW YORK, Oct 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Data quality solutions specialist Imperium (www.imperium.com) today announced the release of a significantly upgraded version of its flagship ID-validation tool RelevantIDÂ®.

This major release is designed to help market research and panel organizations combat the rise of highly sophisticated synthetic identity frauds that are becoming increasingly difficult to catch using conventional fraud-detection models.

From today, the company's powerful fraud-blocking tool FraudienceÂ® will be integrated into RelevantIDÂ® as standard. New and existing clients will now automatically enjoy access to FraudienceÂ®, which monitors respondents' behavior patterns against a proprietary research-based algorithm, quickly identifying potentially fraudulent respondents.

New RelevantIDÂ® additionally includes FraudProbabilityScore, a machine-learning model that assesses passive and behavioral data, returning an extremely precise fraud assessment that detects fraud, bots, and jumpers/ghost completes in surveys.

""We're confident that RelevantIDÂ® offers a genuinely multi-level approach to fraud detection, combining passive machine data with behavioral data to provide a detailed picture of respondents' fraud potential, while fully complying with stringent privacy laws like GDPR,"" said Tim McCarthy, General Manager, Imperium.

McCarthy adds: ""Businesses rely on us to consistently deliver top-level tools that assure data quality. Since supercharging RelevantIDÂ® with FraudienceÂ® and FraudProbabilityScore, we're seeing fraud capture scores skyrocketâon average by more than 5xâfrom 2.5% to 13.8%. Because we're using a machine-learning model, our tools are recognizing new behavior patterns every day, making it easier to stay ahead of determined fraudsters.""

The announcement chimes with the findings in a report on the subject of synthetic identity fraud published this year by the Federal Reserve. The authors of the paper referred to an ID Analytics study estimating that traditional fraud-detection models lacked effectiveness in 85-95 percent of likely synthetic identity frauds.

The extensive link-analysis process that's a core part of Imperium's survey data quality solutions mirrors Federal Reserve recommendations that businesses adopt a 'layered fraud mitigation approach' incorporating 'manual and technological data analysis' to combat the most sophisticated fraud technologies.

165,"THROUGHOUT the Pacific Islands region corruption remains a significant concern, slowing development and shaking public trust in public officials. Corruption can be encountered in a variety of sectors such as the process of harvesting and manufacturing illegal wood based products, illegal fishing, migrant smuggling and working illegally, amongst other crimes. In addition, corruption often facilitates transnational organized crime moving goods across borders and laundering money.

To confront this challenge over 60 representatives from 13 Pacific Island countries and territories met in Fiji in December 2015 for the Anti-Corruption Workshop for Pacific Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to discuss challenges, good practices and innovative anti-corruption reforms. The Workshop is providing participants with an opportunity to consider how corruption can be addressed in the Pacific, consistent with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).

The opening day sessions built upon the work completed at the recent 16th International Anti-Corruption Conference, highlighting the challenges faced regularly by anti-corruption advocates through sessions including âThe Courage of a Whistleblowerâ and âPeople. Accountability. Integrityâ.

Banking and Mexican drug cartel whistleblower Martin Woods, now head of Financial Crime at Thomson Reuters, spoke of the courage officials need to honestly respond âI donât knowâ when presented with disguised corruption-prone proposals.

UN-PRAC Regional Anti-Corruption Adviser, Ms Annika Wythes, told the workshop that civil society participants were a key to interrupting corruption. âWhen we talk about preventing and fighting corruption you are often the glue between the people and the Government â the way that you see an issue, address it and seek to tackle it is crucial. You are the ones who can bring about cultural change in attitudes and behaviors towards corruption. You can identify champions and start direct, open discussions on this topic that is necessary to making any headway on this issue in your countries,â said Ms Wythes.

A strong focus of the workshop was on the sharing of experiences by CSOs, including a Transparency International session on âWhat is Peopleâs Power? How does it Impact Corruption?â, âThe Devil is in the Details â Extractive Industries Transparency Initiativeâ and another by the youth, âThe Youth have the Numbers â Now, How the Pacific Youth are Standing Up to Corruptionâ. The gendered nature of corruption was highlighted during the session, âGender Focus: Sextortion â Where Corruption and Sexual Exploitation Meetâ and corruption was also linked to human rights abuses through a specific advocacy training session.

As innovation is required to get ahead of corruption it was addressed during the session, âHow to Engage Citizens Using Social Networks, Research and Social Mediaâ, drawing on Pacific and international examples. The workshop also raised awareness of the assistance available to Pacific countries in implementing UNCAC under the United Nations Pacific Regional Anti-Corruption (UN-PRAC) Project and the link to the Sustainable Development Goals, recently adopted by the UN General Assembly.

The Workshop was an activity of the UN-PRAC Project jointly implemented by the UNODC and UNDP, with funding from the Australian Government. The Project is a four year initiative that aims to help Pacific Island countries fight corruption by: supporting the ratification of UNCAC; implementing UNCAC through the strengthening of anti-corruption policies, laws, measures and institutional frameworks; and enhancing Pacific Island Stateâs active participation in the UNCAC processes, including the UNCAC Review Mechanism. The Project draws on the strong global partnership and comparative advantages of both organizations in the fight against corruption.",nam
166,"In 1910, undercover agents in New York reportedly thwarted attempts to sell four girls into prostitution. Two of the girls, according to a New York Times story at the time, were only â children of 15 who played with a doll and a teddy bear.â Stories like this one, denouncing the sale of young women and children, typically by foreign immigrants, fueled the white slavery moral panic that spread across United States and Europe in the early 1900s.

Today, historians believe that those stories were significantly inflated and racialized accounts of urban prostitution and sex work. Yet more than a century later, these tales, sometimes apocryphal, have returned with QAnon, the fringe movement that pulls together a collection of conspiracy theories, including the idea that President Trump is fighting a politically connected global sex trafficking ring.

While the problem of sex trafficking is real, QAnon has relied mostly on exaggerated figures and misinformation about the nature of these activities, combining some real cases, like that of financier Jeffrey Epstein, with some blatantly false ones, like an alleged pedophile ring run from the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant (which has no basement).

In many ways, the sensationalist stereotypes of sex trafficking victims promoted by QAnon followers echo the âwhite slaveryâ narratives that spread in U.S. media in the early 1900s. The current proliferation of unrealistic depictions of trafficking victims being kidnapped and â tied up â â frequently by foreigners â obscures the more complex and yet mundane ways in which this crime actually takes place. Instead, human traffickers are more likely family members, intimate partners or trusted adults known to the victims.

More than just obscuring the bigger problem, QAnon threatens to undermine decades of progress made to combat human trafficking. QAnonâs outlandish claims and its attempts to manipulate human trafficking policies for political purposes threaten to erode the international credibility of the U.S. as a global leader in this field and derail the significant progress made in the international fight against human trafficking.",nam
167,"Rodrigo Duterte prefers to speak to his country late at night, when most Filipinos are asleep, leaving weary night-shift reporters left to parse through the Philippine presidentâs scattershot musings on the worsening coronavirus outbreak, the flailing economy, and a new anti-terrorism law which the United Nations and rights groups are worried could morph into an expansive attempt to crush government critics.

Duterteâs latest pre-taped address, which aired around 1 a.m. on Wednesday, was his first chance to speak publicly about the law after it was fast-tracked through Congress despite concerns over the constitutionality of provisions allowing an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president to authorize warrantless arrests, detention without charge for up to 24 days, and 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps. Since taking office in 2016, Duterte has arrested political opponents, overseen thousands of extrajudicial killings in a brutal drug war, and heaped praise on former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, adding to the perception that the new law is the latest in an ongoing backslide into authoritarian rule.

âFor the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist,â he said.

But the lawâs vague definition of terrorism, experts say, leaves Duterteâs council even greater room to identify, detain, and eliminate the administrationâs political enemies. And while the Philippines does face genuine security threats, especially among insurgents aligned with the Islamic State in the southern island of Mindanao, there is little evidence the new law does much to address them.

âThere are no specific provisions about improving the intelligence and evidence-gathering capacities of agents of government,â said Maria Ela L. Atienza, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, Diliman. âWhat the law does is to strengthen the powers of the executive-dominated anti-terrorism council, removing many of the oversight powers of the judiciary and the legislature.â

âThe law,â she said, âhas a chilling effect on various forms of dissent and legitimate criticisms of government.â The law is broad enough to permit the detention of people who make social media posts critical of the government, which has happened on several occasions during the pandemic. ABS-CBN, the countryâs largest television network, was on Friday denied the renewal of its permit to operate, weeks after Rappler editor Maria Ressa was convicted of libel, in an unprecedented crackdown on media outlets critical of the government.

âThe trials faced by Rappler and ABS-CBN show the government brazenly attacking media entities,â said Jonathan Corpus Ong, associate professor of communication at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. âThe broader impact I anticipate is that, in the muffling of mainstream media and withdrawal of political dissenters, the content of public debate would be controlled by the state and more easily influenced by disinformation narratives.â

Local and international rights groups have raised concerns the law will serve as a gut punch to an already reeling Philippine democracy. Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said prior to the bill being signed that it âheightens our concerns on the blurring of important distinctions between criticism, criminality and terrorism,â and international calls have grown for the U.N. to investigate extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.

Duterte has gained global notoriety for his âwar on drugs,â which the countryâs rights commission estimates has taken some 27,000 lives. In recent years, authorities have used drug war tactics to escalate a series of deadly operations targeting land, environmental, and Indigenous activists opposing government infrastructure and development projects.

Police and military maintain these are part of a counterinsurgency campaign against the New Peopleâs Army (NPA), a communist rebel group that Duterte reiterated on Wednesday he considers to be a terrorist organization. But the operations often target civilians or legal activists who have been âred-tagged,â meaning branded as communists or NPA sympathizers, often without evidence. The new law could give Duterte and his council more room to weaponize the gray area between NPA rebels and legal, progressive activist groups who raise the administrationâs ire.

Last year, dozens of farmers and land rights activists on the central island of Negros were arrested or killed in state security operations. Indigenous leaders throughout the archipelago are frequently red-tagged after campaigning against controversial China-funded infrastructure projects, including a series of hydropower dams set to be built on I ndigenous lands that have raised environmental concerns and are funded by shadowy Chinese loans. Datu Jomorito Guaynon, a prominent Indigenous leader in northern Mindanao, has been imprisoned without facing trial for more than a year after opposing private development on his tribeâs ancestral lands. Throughout the Philippines, state operations against dissenters have continued during coronavirus quarantines.

âGovernment officials, including the president, have red-tagged a number of organizations already,â Atienza said. âNow, the anti-terrorism council can define who are the terrorists.â

Prominent dissidents say they are already feeling the heat. Cristina Palabay, secretary-general of the human rights alliance Karapatan, said she was confronted on Tuesday by two police officers, one disguised as a delivery courier, serving an invalid arrest warrant.

âThis incident feels different, more threatening, because of the enactment of the anti-terror law,â said Palabay, a frequent target of harassment in the past.

The law was passed as a more wide-ranging replacement of the countryâs 2007 Human Security Act, which only penalized direct terrorist acts and conspiracy to commit terrorism. Alongside its expansive definition of terrorism and the broad remit given to Duterteâs anti-terrorism council, the law allows for people who propose or sympathize with terrorism to be detained or charged. A petition by a legal group challenging the lawâs constitutionality noted that the musician Bono, who paid homage to jailed opposition Sen. Leila de Lima at a concert in the Philippines last year, could be charged with terrorism.

In the short term, the law is most likely to be added to a toolbox used to target legal activistsâand the Duterte administration, in the middle of a geopolitical tug of war, has plenty of latitude to use it. Beijing has invested heavily in the Philippines, despite broad public criticism and the potentially illegal nature of some of its big-ticket projects. Duterteâs own links to China have raised eyebrows: He is remarkably conciliatory toward Beijing despite his fierce nationalism, South China Sea island disputes, and the harassment of Filipino fishermen. And although Duterte has moved away from Washington, the United States retains strong relations with the Philippine military and continues to support its counterinsurgency campaign. In April, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump notified U.S. Congress of two potential arms sales to the Philippines, and Duterte last month reversed an earlier decision to pull out of a military agreement with the United States.

Palabay anticipates that, while she will continue to find herself in the administrationâs crosshairs, the lawâs most severe effects will be felt by Philippine society.

âI think human rights defenders, activists, opposition, and dissenters will be targeted, including those here in Manila, maybe even us in Karapatan,â she said. âBut if there are attempts to silence these voices, it would still be the public who stands to lose much.â",nam

171,"Salv, an anti-money laundering (AML) startup founded by former TransferWise and Skype employees, has raised $2 million in seed funding.

The round is led by Fly Ventures, alongside Passion Capital and Seedcamp. Angel investors also participating include N26 founder Maximilian Tayenthal (who seems to be doing quite a bit of angel investing), former Twilio CTO Ott Kaukver, and Taavi Kotka, former CIO for Estonia (the actual country!).

Founded in June 2018 and initially offering consultancy, Estonia -based Salv has built a software platform that helps banks find and stop financial crime. The idea, says co-founder and CEO Taavi Tamkivi, is to move AML beyond just compliance to something more proactive that actually does defeat crime. Thatâs quite the promise, although he and his co-founders have a lot experience to draw from, both within fast-growing startups and AML.

Tamkivi built the AML, fraud, and Know Your Customer (KYC) teams at TransferWise and Skype . COO Jeff McClelland also worked in the anti-fraud team at Skype, followed by a stint at TransferWise, first as an analyst and then in HR. And CTO Sergei Rumjantsev was also formerly at TransferWise, leading the engineering team responsible for KYC and verification.

âThis was a highly demanding role, especially given how fast TransferWise was growing, how many new markets were coming online, and how central user verification is for compliance,â Tamkivi tells me. âUnder Sergeiâs leadership, the team made the verification process incredibly smooth over time for genuine customers. But also robust enough to protect TransferWise from on-boarding bad actorsâ.

Bad actors within financial services are aplenty, of course. Yet, despite the European banking sector spending billions tackling the problem, it is estimated that only 1-2% of global money-laundering is detected.

âAML should be all about stopping money laundering but, particularly in the last decade, layer upon layer of regulations have been added for banks to comply with,â says Tamkivi. âThis would be great if that meant that there was no more money laundering, but sadly, thatâs a long way off. Today, between $1-2 trillion a year is still laundered. But the excessive regulations mean that nearly all of a bankâs compliance teamâs effort goes into compliance. They have very little energy left to actually focus on improving their financial crime-fighting abilities. The software theyâre using is similar, focused almost wholly on compliance, not crime-fightingâ.

That is where Salv wants to step in, and Tamkivi says the main difference between the startupâs AML software and other existing solutions is a much greater emphasis on crime-fighting rather than a box-ticking compliance exercise.

âWeâre aiming to create a transformation similar to whatâs happened in virus scanning,â he says. â10-15 years ago virus scanners on everyoneâs PCs were an enormous hassle, consumed tons of resources and stopped you from getting work done. The same is true in financial institutions today. Theyâre using outdated, heavy software and processes to handle AML. But today, virus scanning still happens, but nobodyâs worried about it. It happens in the background, with few resources. Weâll do the same in the AML worldâ.

In addition, the Salv CEO claims that the companyâs software is faster than competitorsâ offerings, both in terms of set up time and integration, and making changes to the rules the system adheres to.

âOur system, by contrast, takes a month or less to set up and minutes to modify the rules,â he says. âAs a result, our customers can take everything they learn today from new criminal patterns, encode it in automated rules tomorrow, and repeat that cycle every day to protect their bank. Moving fast is the only way to keep up with the innovative organised criminals moving millions or billions around the worldâ.

To that end, Salv already counts Estonian bank LHV as its first customer. âThey offer a full suite of banking products across Estonia,â says Tamkivi. âTheyâre also active in London, in particular, supporting fintechs. We have another couple of customers in the Lithuanian fintech scene. One of those is DeVere e- Moneyâ .

More generally, Salvâs product is said to be suitable for Tier 2 and Tier 3 banks, as well as regulated fintechs and challenger banks.

Meanwhile, the business model is straightforward enough. Salv charges a monthly subscription, while the price varies based on the number of active customers a bank or fintech has.",nam

David Robinson, the regional anti-corruption advisor at the UNâs Office on Drugs and Crime, believes that new technologies like blockchain will help Kenya combat government corruption and other economic crimes.

According to Nation Media Group on Nov. 3, Robinson claimed that blockchain-based solutions can provide full traceability of transactions, protecting public registries from fraud and forgery. The official said:

âBlockchain technology becomes attractive to the global community and international organizations because it is a tool that can be used to potentially prevent corruption and protect public registries from fraud and tampering.â

Robinson said that technologies like blockchain are an important tool for increasing trust, as corruption represents a breach of the public trust. âOnline trust became a key asset for transactions between strangers and building confidence in government,â he stated.

Kenya is reportedly losing up to a third of its budget to corruption each year due to a lack of modern equipment and technology for fighting graft. Failures to track corruption cases reportedly cause the country to lose as much as $6 billion each year.

A number of countries around the world have been looking at both blockchain technology and crypto as potential tools to combat corruption.

175,"The legislative process on Capitol Hill is often slow and grinding. There are committee hearings, filibuster threats and hours of floor debate. But sometimes, when Congress really wants to get something done, it can move blindingly fast.

That's what happened when Congress moved to undo large parts of a popular law known as the STOCK Act last week.

A year ago, President Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act into law at a celebratory ceremony attended by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers.

""I want to thank all the members of Congress who came together and worked to get this done,"" he said.

The law wouldn't just outlaw trading on nonpublic information by members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs. It would greatly expand financial disclosures and make all of the data searchable so insider trading and conflicts of interest would be easier to detect.

But on Monday, when the president signed a bill reversing big pieces of the law, the emailed announcement was one sentence long. There was no fanfare last week either, when the Senate and then the House passed the bill in largely empty chambers using a fast-track procedure known as unanimous consent.

In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., shepherded the bill through. It was Friday afternoon at 12:52. Many members had already left for the weekend or were on their way out. The whole process took only 30 seconds. There was no debate.

""There weren't too many members of Congress who were aware of this legislation,"" says Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. ""And I suspect very, very few understood what a sweeping radical change it is to the STOCK Act.""

Records In The Basement

To understand how the law changed, I asked Holman to meet me in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building.

""This is where the public records are kept, for those who can handle traveling to Washington, D.C.,"" Holman explained.

That's right. If you want to look up the financial disclosure forms filed by high-level congressional staffers â say, to find out whether they've been using the privileges of their positions to make well-timed stock trades â you have to come to this office.

Holman showed me how it works. You have to enter your name and address into a computer, and then you can search. But you have to know the name of the person you are searching for. If he or she has filed a financial disclosure form, it will come up as a PDF, which you can print at a cost of 10 cents a page.

""The database itself is almost meaningless,"" says Holman. He says the only option for those who want to get a comprehensive look at what some 2,900 staffers have filed is to review the cases one by one. ""And that's just too big a job for anybody to do.""

The STOCK Act was supposed to make this task significantly easier. Records for members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs were supposed to be posted online in a searchable, sortable and downloadable format.

If you wanted to see who traded health care stock just before a committee acted on a health care bill, it would be easy. No trips to the basement required.

But there were concerns, especially among the 28,000 executive branch staff who would be required to post their financial disclosures online.

Going Too Far?

""There were particular concerns about risks for those who either travel overseas on government business or work overseas,"" says Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, who represents many of those executive branch employees.

An independent study said there were also risks of identity theft, which she says the new law helps avoid.

""What has been eliminated now is the ability of people to go phishing, if you will,"" she says.

The White House cited the independent report in explaining why the president signed the bill. And a spokesman for Cantor said the House and Senate were simply following recommendations of the study. But Lisa Rosenberg, a lobbyist for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocated for the STOCK Act, says Congress went too far.

""It's really shocking that they used basically the situation of questions about whether some language in the bill was overbroad to just gut the bill â to gut the transparency measures that apply to themselves,"" she says.

Still, two major elements of the law remain. Insider trading is illegal, even for members of Congress and the executive branch. And for those who are covered by the now-narrower law, disclosures of large stock trades are required within 45 days. It will just be harder to get to them.",nam
176,"AI technology has proven to be reliable, especially when it comes to detecting money laundering, and is empowering leading firms to tackle the issues in an increasingly effective manner, writes John Spooner.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from being a technology buzzword to the commercial reality it is today. This technology is making a positive impact across many industries, including the financial sector.

The financial services industry has a reputation for constant innovation in the pursuit of finding new revenue opportunities. This is happening across all segments including capital markets, commercial banking, consumer finance and insurance.

The use of AI in financial services is changing the business landscape, even in traditionally conservative areas. According to a Bank of England survey of 500 UK financial institutions, two-thirds of respondents were reported to have already been using machine learning in some form, with the median firm using live ML applications in two business areas. This is expected to more than double within the next three years.

Financial institutions today utilise AI for areas such as customer service, risk management, fraud detection and anti-money laundering, while adhering to regulatory compliance. AI technology has proven to be reliable, especially when it comes to detecting money laundering, and is empowering leading firms to tackle the issues in an increasingly effective manner.

Traditional approaches for tackling money laundering

Money laundering poses a serious threat to the financial services sector. Fines for banks that fail to prevent money laundering are now worth more than $10 billion per year. Banks have constructed large teams, and allocated them time-consuming tasks of identifying and investigating suspicious transactions, which often takes place within a complex network of players.

Typically, investigation teams use rule-based systems to identify any suspicious transactions. This rule-based workflow consists of the following three steps: Firstly, an alert is generated by the alerting system; secondly, the investigator reviews it using information from different sources and finally, the alert is approved as True Positive or classified as False Positive.

A False Positive can be defined as an error in data reporting, in which a test result improperly indicates the presence of a condition that in reality is not present.

However, the problem with rule-based systems is that they create a large number of false positives, usually in the range of 75 to 99 percent. These means that a vast amount of time and manual effort is being wasted to investigate these false alerts. The high number occurs because the rules can become outdated quickly and it takes time for the systems to be re-coded.

How AI can address false positives

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programmes deploy rule-based transaction monitoring systems, spanning areas across monetary thresholds and money laundering patterns. However, bad actors can adapt to these rules over time, and tweak their methods accordingly to avoid detection.

This is where AI-based behavioural modellingand customer segmentation can be more effective by discovering transaction behaviours and identify behavioural patterns and outliers that indicates any potential laundering.

AI, especially time series modelling, is particularly effective at examining a series of complex transactions and finding anomalies. Anti-money laundering using machine learning techniques are able to identify suspicious transactions, and also irregular networks of transactions. These transactions are flagged for investigation, and can be scored as high, medium, or low priority, so that the investigator is able to prioritise their efforts.

AI can also provide reason codes for the decision to flag transactions. These reason codes tell the investigator where they might need to search to uncover the issues, and help to streamline the investigative process. AI is also able to learn from the investigators throughout the review, clearing any suspicious transactions and automatically reinforcing the AI modelâs understanding and ability to avoid patterns that donât lead to laundered money.

AI vs. rule-based systems

AI-powered AML systems provide many advantages over an existing rule-based system. This includes being able to dramatically reduce false positives, provide a curated set of alerts to the investigator and the ability to ingest domain-specific IP customised for money laundering.

The AI technology can be strategically placed between the AML rule-based system and the investigator, which allows companies to gain a rapid return of investment. Overall, the average investigation time is dramatically reduced from between 45 to 90 days to mere seconds. It also greatly reduces any human inaccuracies and hours required per person, and can fit rule-gaps with innovative features.

Address money laundering and drive productivity

When used effectively, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a critical factor to success in the financial services industry. It enables financial services companies to not only efficiently build personalised banking experiences, fraud and money laundering models but will also improve employee and business productivity.

As money laundering networks become ever more complex, the time is now, for progressive financial intuitions to start embracing AI in order to effectively combat money laundering, and to focus even more effectively on driving overall productivity.",nam
177,"Criminals are targeting cash-strapped students to act as money mules, with the number of under-21s being recruited to launder money tripling in the past three years, according to figures from Barclays.

Nearly a third of all money mules - people who help launder money by receiving it into their bank account and transferring it on - reported to Barclays last year, by victims and other banks, were under the age of 21, says the bank.

And, with more than half of students worrying about their financial situation on a weekly basis, criminals are actively targeting them as they start the new academic year.

Gangs are using social media and messaging services to lure students into laundering dirty cash with fake job adverts offering easy money. These tactics appeal to students as six in 10 would be tempted to click through to find out more about a recruitment advert for a dream role at a company they have never heard of.

Meanwhile the added money pressures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, means that one in twenty students are more likely to consider making easy money if approached, even if it looks suspicious.

About 40% of students are unaware of the consequences of acting as a money mule, which can land perpetrators in prison for up to 14 years. When asked who they would tell if they were approached to be a money mule, only half of students say that they would turn to the police and only two in five would tell their bank.

Ross Martin, head, digital safety, Barclays, says: âWith the start of the new academic year, itâs a prime time for fraudsters to be targeting young people with the lure of making easy money.

""It might be particularly tempting given the current situation with the job market and the need for extra money if family finances are tight. Always do your research and check that the job is legitimate - donât run the risk of damaging your future career and finances.â",nam
178,"Several extensive investigations around the globe into the activities of banks have revealed massive failings in the fight against money laundering. The research showed that more and more criminals are exploiting the financial system and laundering their black money by means of quick and immediate remittances. Banks face the challenge of keeping their ever-increasing compliance costs under control. To keep the balance between security on the one hand and cost efficiency on the other, financial service providers need to improve their compliance systems â but how?

Fortunately, supervisory authorities are adapting to advances in analytics, which will help financial institutions. There is a growing willingness to trust new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning or robotics. Authorities actively encourage banks to consider, evaluate and, if necessary, implement these innovative solutions.

This does not mean that the existing risk-based approach, which is based on good compliance knowledge in defining ""detection scenarios"", is no longer valid. In fact, many regulators insist that AML controls need to remain explainable and auditable, they see its application in supplementing existing controls. Hence, a kind of coexistence is emerging â a mixture of the existing scenarios and the AI mechanisms.

Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables banks to massively streamline and automate investigations and alert processing within their KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) solutions. Until now, entire crowds of investigators have often been hired only to do the initial processing of alerts, which typically consists of at least 90 to 95 percent of false positives. This is especially true in Watchlist Screening, where a lack of data quality and the nature of the matching process itself create massive amounts of alerts, which to the human eye are obviously false. In doing so, clearly defined alert and case rules â which are specifically adapted to the situation of the financial institution, products, customers, etc. â can cover many of the repetitive activities, thereby minimizing duplication of efforts, while still retaining full audit trails. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) should therefore be integrated into company-wide alert and case management.

This also ensures that investigators time is freed up from mundane tasks, so they can focus on more complex work.

RPA and analytics-based alert prioritization even helps to reduce costs in the short term. Above all, however, the combination of both ensures enormous efficiency and efficiency improvements. Experience from the everyday life of FICO's customers has shown that the number of suspected cases increases by up to 20 percent through appropriate implementations, while at the same time increasing efficiency by up to 30 percent in alert and case management.

Deus ex Machina

However, automation and analytics are not the only means to effectively combat money laundering. As early as 2017, a study by McKinsey showed that machine learning could reduce the number of ""false positives"" by 20-30 percent. At the same time, machine learning in the AML area can improve the conversion rate ""from alarm to suspicion"" by a factor of three thanks to tighter segmentation.

Examples of finer segmentation include isolating the fact that a customer has financial relationships outside the country, is a wealthy private individual or is a small business owner. While a risk-based segmentation into such customer groups can be done via configuration of expert systems, given the complexity of all our individual lives, it is also a mammoth task when done manually, and very hard to maintain over time. In this way, machine learning calls into question the status quo of KYC processes, as it can take over such an ongoing segmentation by using real-time behavioral analysis based on financial transaction activities. It furthermore can add value by sifting through banks mountains of data, exploring, and finding unknown connections. Again, a boon for KYC operations by providing more information, while reducing effort.

One of the most basic requirements in AML is to ensure that we are keeping audit trails of our own actions, as well as the underlying machine behavior. This is very easily done with rules-based systems, since we can point to the underlying typologies we have used when defining them and explain the thresholds we have chosen. Hence, machine learning models need to be similarly explainable in the event of an investigation, or an external audit. For example, the following example shows how the different variables of the model (V1-V6 on the far left) are incorporated into the machine learning algorithms, the results of which are processed by a Reason Reporting and Ranking algorithm. The reasons are sorted by importance and relevance to explain how the model came to the evaluation. Despite the model not using fixed thresholds like a rule would, an analyst can therefore easily see why an alert has been created.

Strong together

Another way for financial institutions to reduce costs and improve business outcomes is to connect AML and fraud detection solutions, as FICO has done for our clients.

These are relatively similar and meet many common requirements, such as detecting unusual behavior. Unfortunately, most banks still operate them in a silo environment.

The use of a fully scalable IT environment that simultaneously meets both fraud detection and AML requirements would not only provide a cost advantage â it would also allow financial institutions to act ""cross-border"" in detecting illegal activities.",nam
179,"Today Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube and Twitter collectively announced a new partnership aimed at reducing the accessibility of internet services to terrorists. The new Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism adds structure to existing efforts by the companies to target and remove from major web platforms recruiting materials for terror groups.

Together, the four tech leaders say they will collaborate on engineering solutions to the problem, sharing content classification techniques and effective reporting methods for users. Each company also will contribute to both technical and policy research and share best practices for counterspeech initiatives.

Back in December of 2016, the same four companies announced the creation of a shared industry hash database. By sharing hashes with each other, the group was able to collectively identify terror accounts without each having to do the time- and resource-intensive legwork independently. This new organization creates more formal bureaucracy for improving that database.

Similarly, Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube and Twitter will be teaching smaller companies and organizations to follow in their footsteps to adopt their own proactive plans for combating terror. A portion of this training will cover key strategies for executing counterspeech programs like YouTubeâs Creators for Change and Facebookâs P2P and OCCI.

All of these actions are occurring side-by-side with public sector efforts. The G7 has been vocal about the importance of combating extremism with a multi-pronged approach. Todayâs partnership further solidifies the relationship between four multi-national tech companies with the aim of pushing back against terrorism on their respective platforms.",nam

The country's top medical security authority launched a nationwide campaign in September to discover issues and combat violations associated with healthcare insurance funds.

""The campaign has recovered a great deal of medical insurance money,"" he told reporters at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. ""About 66,000 medical institutions in breach of regulations have been identified, and 24,000 individuals were found to have committed frauds.""

""There is still an arduous task ahead in order to root out healthcare scams, and this task will be a top priority for us,"" he said.

A host of measures will be rolled out, according to Hu, including increasing the number of random examinations and sample collections to make full use of the reward system for whistleblowers, and deploying information technologies, especially big data to help identify violators.",nam
181,"The draft legislation, currently before the Swiss Parliament, expands the definition of terrorism and no longer requires the prospect of any crime at all, they said, in a plea for a last-minute reversal by legislators.

âExpansiveâ definition of terrorism

Citing international standards, the experts defined terrorism as the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through violence that causes death or serious injury, or the taking of hostages.

Under the bill, âterrorist activityâ may encompass even lawful acts aimed at influencing or modifying the constitutional order, such as legitimate activities of journalists, civil society and political activists.

âExpanding the definition of terrorism to any non-violent campaign involving the spreading of fear goes far beyond current Swiss domestic law and violates international standardsâ, said the experts, all of whom were appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.

âThis excessively expansive definition sets a dangerous precedent and risks serving as a model for authoritarian governments seeking to suppress political dissent including through torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.â

Other sections of the draft law have also raised concerns, such as those giving the federal police extensive authority to designate âpotential terroristsâ and to decide preventive measures against them.

Expertise declined

The rights experts had earlier written to the Swiss authorities, expressing their concerns about the incompatibility of the bill with human rights and international best practices in counter-terrorism. However, no changes were implemented.

âWhile we recognize the serious security risks posed by terrorism, we very much regret that the Swiss authorities have declined this opportunity to benefit from our technical assistance and expertise on how to combine effective preventive measures with respect for human rightsâ, they said.

The experts called on Swiss parliamentarians to keep in mind their countryâs traditionally strong commitment to human rights, urging them to reject a law which âis bound to become a serious stain on Switzerlandâs otherwise strong human rights legacy.â

182,"On 3rd November 2020, the Government published its long-awaited response to its January 2017 call for evidence on the question of reforming the law on corporate liability for economic crime. The Government found the evidence inconclusive overall, so it has asked the Law Commission to draft an Options Paper, to assess how effective the current law is relating to corporate criminal liability and where improvements can be made.

The Government response can be read here.

Sam Tate, Head of our White Collar Crime Team, and Lucy Kerr share their key expectations regarding the next steps in this process:

1. The long-standing ""Identification Principle"" will be the focal point of the review as it is the fundamental route to corporate criminal liability at present, whereby a company may only be held criminally liable through the individuals that represent its ""directing mind and will"".

2. The Identification Principle has proven to be a great obstacle to the prosecution of companies in recent years (especially large ones) for economic crimes. The failed prosecution of Barclays Bank by the Serious Fraud Office in 2018 will no doubt be a significant influence on reassessing this area of law, where even the CEO and CFO of Barclays Bank did not constitute the company's directing mind and will.

3. There has, nonetheless, already been some significant movement in the law on corporate criminal liability in the last decade with the introduction of the offences of: (i) failing to prevent bribery under the Bribery Act 2010; and (ii) failing to prevent corporate tax evasion under the Criminal Finances Act 2017.

4. The House of Commons Treasury Committee report in March 2019 urged reform to the existing economic crime law, so it is anticipated that a new wider ""failure to prevent"" offence will be a key option put forward by the Law Commission. However, the mechanics of any such offence for new categories of economic crime, such as fraud, will need to be approached with caution. Unlike bribery, the corporate is often the victim of a fraud offence at the hands of its employees, rather than being a beneficiary. In addition, for money laundering offences any adequate procedure defence will need to dovetail with FCA requirements or risk creating confusion and unnecessary complexity. Getting these and other issues right will be important to avoid burdening companies with unwieldy regulation as they adapt to the twin impacts of COVID19 and Brexit.

5. The publication of the Law Commission report is not expected until late 2021. Therefore, whatever options are put forward, we expect that any changes to the law will be slow to appear and not occur until 2022 or even later.",am
183,"Last year, payments giant Stripe announced that it would donate $1 million of its own funds annually into companies that are building technology to remove carbon from our environment, with the recipients of that investment announced in May of this year. Now, itâs expanding that commitment with a new product aimed at getting its customers to invest, too.

Today, the company is launching Stripe Climate, a new tool that companies using Stripe can integrate to set up automatic contributions that are made as a percentage of each transaction â the company can set the percentage itself â with the proceeds feeding into an add-on pot on top of Stripeâs own investments in carbon reduction companies.

Currently there are four companies on that investment list: CarbonCure (which injects captured carbon dioxide into concrete, permanently removing it from the atmosphere); Climeworks, which is building carbon removal plants; Project Vesta, which has worked on projects like âgreen sandâ to remove carbon on beaches; and Charm Industrial (converting waste biomass to bio-oil). These are âearthshots,â as it were â not completely proven tech that might be too costly to run if it does work â but as with moonshots, there will be a lot of capital needed even to see how and if they can get off the ground.

Itâs also likely there will be more efforts added to the list â and maybe some subtracted â over time.

For now, companies using Stripe Climate donât get a chance to choose how their contributions get invested: they basically mirror and follow the path of those being made by Stripe itself.

Stripe Climate is free to use, and Stripe said that the 25 companies testing the service in a closed beta â the list includes Flexport, Substack, Flipcause and OpenSnow â have already contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the effort.

âWe built Substack because, while itâs easy to be depressed about the current state of the media business, we think thereâs tremendous opportunity for those daring enough to be optimistic. We feel the same way about climate change,â said Chris Best, co-founder and CEO of Substack, in a statement. âWeâre done with defaulting to depression. We want to help show the way to a better futureâand better yet, we want to give all Substack writers the opportunity to join us. Stripeâs climate initiative is a gift because it removes all barriers to positive action. This program makes it easy, and valuable, to do the right thing. Weâre proud to be part of it.â

Stripe Climate is playing on some important themes at the company.

Stripe â now valued at $36 billion â has made a name for itself primarily through a simple payments service that site and app developers can integrate by way of APIs, using a few lines of code. That has helped the company grow fast and pick up a huge number of users, from sole-trader outfits to much bigger businesses.

The company is using the same low-friction principle here with Stripe Climate: the idea is that while companies and individuals might in theory be committed to making investments in environmental causes, many donât know where to begin, or how to do it in an efficient way. This gives them that way, having it integrated as part of its existing payments flow.

âA lot of the social issues right now are collective action problems,â said Nan Ransohoff, Stripeâs head of climate, in an interview. âClimate change is a collective action problem. Coordinating can be complicated and expensive. So can we make it easy to bring Stripe businesses together to make the whole bigger than the sum of its parts? If we can do it even a little bit we as a planet we will be in a better place.â

The second theme of this is how it fits into what Stripe is building on a more strategic level. Basic payments may be the companyâs bread and butter, but on top of that itâs been adding a host of other services for businesses, from tools to help them incorporate their operations in the U.S., through to fraud prevention and analytics, and money advances and credit based on their existing activity on the platform. And the other week it also made its largest ever acquisition, buying a startup called Paystack in Nigeria, to enter more comprehensively into new geographies like Africa.

The idea is not just to make more money from their customers through value-added services, but to increase stickiness with customers, who might be less reluctant to switch out a simple API if that data is also integrated into a number of other parts of their business and how they operate.

Stripe Climate isnât going to make Stripe or its customers any money â in fact, itâs a way for its customers to give money away â but itâs a very strong goodwill gesture that could go some way to building more loyalty and regard with its customers.

Ransohoff said that the plan will also be to expand Stripe Climate into a tool that these companies can also in turn offer to their own customers at checkout â not unlike the many offers you might already see these days to contribute money toward good causes when you are hitting âbuy nowâ on any number of sites.",nam
184,"Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has stressed that despite repeated conspiracies against the State government, the governmentâs stance of zero tolerance for corruption will continue unaffected. He also averred that the mafia and corrupt elements have been orchestrating conspiracies repeatedly targeting him but will not succeed in diluting his determination in the fight against corruption.

âVarious types of conspiracies are being orchestrated. Many conspiracies were hatched during these past three and a half years. The mafia and corrupt elements are uniting and trying to attack us. However, we remain undaunted and our zero tolerance for corruption on the first day remains the same now and will remain so when we complete five years in office.

185,"In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, when people are frightened and in need of reassurance, itâs common for governments to propose a tough response and new laws.

This is what recently happened in the UK after an attack in Streatham, London, by convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman. On Streatham High Road, Amman stabbed two people before being shot dead by police. He had been under police surveillance since his release from prison in January 2020 for terror offences.

Since the attack, the UK government said emergency legislation would be introduced to end the automatic early release from prison of terror offenders after they have served half of their sentence. Instead, they will be required to serve two-thirds of their sentence.

But there is a major issue with this proposal: itâs not at all clear that such a move would stop people committing these types of atrocities in the first place. And it also raises significant human rights concerns.

âRehabilitation rarely worksâ

This latest attack follows another recent incident in London where two Cambridge University graduates were stabbed to death and at least three other people were seriously wounded by convicted terrorist Usman Khan.

In the aftermath of the Streatham attack, Boris Johnson boldly stated that rehabilitation for convicted terrorists ârarely worksâ. So by his own admission, it seems the plan to increase the length of time terrorists will serve by 17% will also fail.

That said, there are no statistics in the UK to either back up or refute the prime ministerâs claim. The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and now member of the House of Lords, Lord Anderson, recently asked the Ministry of Justice for figures on how many convicted terrorists commit further terror offences when released from prison. It remains to be seen what the answer is.

There is some evidence from elsewhere that deradicalisation programmes in prisons can work to some extent. But care is needed when comparing different state programmes and different groups labelled as terrorist.

Evidence from Sri Lanka, for example, looks at deradicalisation with a group of Tamil Tigers â who sought to secure an independent state of Tamil Eelam. In this instance, the group had a distinct goal that could be identified and engaged with. Likewise, the conflict in Northern Ireland came to an end with the peace settlement of the Good Friday Agreement. It was this, rather than any deradicalisation programme that ended the violence there.

My research, however, has shown that a key factor to the endless âwar on terrorâ is the idea that Islamic extremist terrorism has no feasible goal â so there is nothing to negotiate with.

This raises the question of whether rehabilitation programmes would work on Islamic extremist terrorists or the ever increasing numbers of far-right extremists in UK prisons.

Retroactive punishment?

The proposals to change terrorist sentences also raise enormous human rights concerns. Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits retrospective criminal laws. This means a person cannot be punished for something that was not a crime at the time they committed an act and that if the act was already criminalised, they cannot be made to suffer a harsher sentence.

So it may be the governmentâs proposals to change the automatic release dates will be found by the courts to amount to retrospective punishment. In some cases people will have pleaded guilty on the basis they would be released at the halfway point of their sentences.

Retrospective criminal punishment was a notorious tool used by Nazi Germany to target their enemies. The stigma attached to retrospective criminal laws is so strong, the European Convention on Human Rights does not even allow states to use this during a state of emergency. So itâs inevitable that a challenge to these laws will end up before the courts â and may set the stage for a future clash between the UK government and the European Court of Human Rights.

Restrictions and relocation

The UK already has some of the most robust counter-terrorist laws in the world. Indeed, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has the power to place an array of restrictions on a person she suspects is involved in terrorism-related activity.

Known as TPIM (Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures), this can include electronic tagging, periodic reporting to a police station, house arrest for certain periods of the day, excluding a person from certain areas and restricting their electronic communications. In certain instances, people can even be subjected to forced relocation orders, requiring them to move away from their home address.

Police had been following Sudesh Amman closely since his release, as they believed he posed a high risk of committing an attack. But the home secretary did not make him subject to a TPIM. This seems an oversight given his risk of re-offending was thought to be so high that police were monitoring him closely in the lead up to the attack. This also raises further questions: when are TPIMs being used and how often?

Eroding democracy

Two attacks by recently released offenders would suggest terrorists re-offending is a genuine issue. But without the statistics to show how many convicted terrorists commit further terror offences when released from prison, itâs hard to know the scale of the problem. And going by the available evidence, itâs difficult to say whether such changes in law would make us safer.

Yet with every new attack and the new counter-terrorist laws that follow, what is certain is that human rights are being eroded further still. This is not to take away from the suffering of victims, but governments must think very carefully before sacrificing those very human rights that give the state its identity and democracy.",nam
186,"Harmonisation of rules and requirements throughout the European Union (EU) would help to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) efforts in an effective manner, eliminate existing regulatory fragmentation and ensure a unified European approach, according to the Bank of Lithuania.

âWith requirements for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing continuously growing more rigid and given the free movement of financial services within the single market, everyone needs more clarity and precision. This would help financial market participants operating both in Lithuania and other EU countries to expand their activities in the single market,â said Marius Jurgilas, Member of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.

On 7 May 2020, the European Commission adopted an action plan for a comprehensive Union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing and launched a public consultation. The action plan builds on six pillars, including developing a single EU rulebook for combating money laundering and terrorist financing and creating an EU level supervisory framework (mechanism).

According to the Bank of Lithuania, common rules, especially in areas such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, would bring more clarity both to financial market participants and supervisory authorities.

Currently, rules and requirements for market participants as well as supervisory practices in EU Member States vary, which gives rise to numerous questions concerning their treatment and uniform application. A common approach, possibly in the form of regulations, would help to tackle this issue.

Should a new authority be established to tackle this issue across the EU, it is important to ensure that it does not duplicate the work of national supervisory authorities, does not give rise to disproportionate administrative costs and strikes a good balance between national and European responsibilities, it added.

The central bankâs position was submitted in the framework of the European Commissionâs public consultation on the review of the EU legal framework on AML/CTF.",nam
187,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced legislation on Friday to combat white collar crimes such as insider trading and collusion, the latest in a series of proposals aimed at quelling the demands of continuing protests over inequality.

Pinera shipped several bills to Congress to beef up penalties against colluding to fix prices on sensitive consumer products, while stiffening fines and jail time for financial crimes ranging from fraud to insider trading.

The legislation also provides regulators with more tools to investigate the crimes and establishes new protections for âwhistleblowersâ in both public and private sectors who come forward with evidence of crimes.

âThe immense majority of Chileans want to build a more just, more equal Chile, without abuses or privileges. Thatâs the message we have heard loud and clear from the people,â Pinera said in a speech at the La Moneda presidential palace.

Price fixing and other financial crimes lie at the heart of recent protests over social and economic injustices in Chile that have left at least 31 dead and wrought billions in damages to business.

Since Chileâs return to democracy in 1990, allegations of price fixing have cropped up in markets for items from chicken to diapers, milk, drugs, asphalt and even gynecological visits, outraging many Chileans, who demand changes to the countryâs economic model.

Anger over these abuses appears in graffiti spray-painted on building walls across Santiago, a city of 6 million, and in the signs carried by protesters rebuking such crimes.

âWhen these bills become law, we will have freer, more transparent markets, more competitive companies, products of higher quality and lower prices,â Pinera said.

Chileans will vote on whether to rewrite the countryâs dictatorship-era constitution in April. Many have also called for tougher consumer protections to be worked into a new Magna Carta.

Pinera said on Friday he would soon announce further protections for consumer and worker rights.",nam
188,"A fatal mass exodus has gripped southern India as residents flee in response to images and messages of impending attacks. The problem is the pictures are faked and false rumors of impending doom are being circulated through SMS. âMorphed pictures, false messages were used to provocate people and trigger panic,â Indian Home Secretary R.K. Singh told reporters. âA total of 76 websites were identified where morphed images were uploaded, and the bulk of these were uploaded in Pakistan.â A ban on bulk texting had attempted to stem earlier threats as officials assured residents of their safety, but this cheap new form of terrorism is overwhelming.

The unknown source of the Indian rumors exploited recent sectarian violence in the northeastern city of Assam that have left 75 dead and 300,000 stranded in shelters. Northeastern migrants, many of whom had recently moved to the south to find work, were supposedly threatened by retaliatory attacks if they did not return home. âWe have seen the messages on our phones and on the internet. It is not safe to stay here, we are safer at home,â said one student.

Panicked stampedes have already claimed the the lives of two and injured 9 others after fearful residents pushed victims from a moving train. Indian authorities have been shuttering websites and social media accounts like a game of whack-a-mole, but itâs difficult to see how they can keep up.

The incident underscores both the accessibility of new forms of cyber-terrorism and the tricky credibility of social media.

Having experienced SMS rumors of a deadly gunman myself as graduate student at UC Irvine, I know how powerfully credibly social media can seem. Mild panic gripped the campus in 2009 when rumors of a gunman began circulating through Facebook and SMS. UCI authorities alerted students to stay inside. Getting official reports was difficult, since the university website was crippled by incoming traffic. Facebook and Twitter, which were much better sources of real-time information, spread conflicting reports.

The university did eventually send out official emergency messages via text, but waiting 10 or 15 minutes to receive them was a disturbingly long amount of time. In the midst of (perceived) threats, we updated Facebook and Twitter by the second. Ultimately, the âgunmanâ was just some guy with a paintball gun, but that didnât stop me and my students from fearfully hiding inside until well after the incident was over.

Since Twitter and Facebook are both faster sources of information and are relaying potential first-hand accounts, theyâre a tempting source of credibility, especially when fear leads one to err on the side of believing the more dangerous rumors.

India is unfortunately vulnerable to prolonged rumors, but its easy to see how this new form of terrorism, combining realistic images and SMS, could cause crowds in any country to panic. The situation brings renewed urgency for Congress to start making real gains on cybersecurity legislation, which has thus far been blocked by partisan gridlock. While the the most recent bill only deals with direct cyber attacks, itâs imperative that our government be able to make steady progress on national security.",nam

In the Philippines, the government of President Rodrigo Duterte says a new law is needed to fight terrorists. His opponents say that law could be used to suppress activists and ordinary citizens. Here's NPR's Julie McCarthy.

JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Security specialist Sidney Jones (ph) says there's not a terror law anywhere in the world that has struck the perfect balance between human rights protections and what might be called repressive measures. And she says the Philippines' Anti-Terror Act that President Duterte recently signed into law replaces...

SIDNEY JONES: One of the worst anti-terror laws that was ever passed because it had so many safeguards that it was never used - or almost never used.

MCCARTHY: It levied a fine of $10,000 a day on any agency found to have illegally detained a suspect, reason enough for law enforcers to avoid the old law. But does the new law go too far in the other direction? Not for President Duterte, who downplayed the impact of the sweeping new measure in an address to the nation last week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE: For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all of sincerity. (Non-English language spoken).

MCCARTHY: ""Don't be scared if you're not a terrorist, if you don't destroy the government, explode churches, explode public utilities or derail the country."" But lawyers and activists say the law is not benign. And human rights attorney Neri Colmenares says they have petitioned to the Supreme Court to overturn it on the grounds it is too broad.

NERI COLMENARES: We are saying that this is really an act that penalizes intentions and within the discretion of the government to define.

MCCARTHY: Meaning, he says, you don't have to bomb the bus station to face terror charges. Having the intention to bomb would be enough. Then there's due process. A suspect could be subject to surveillance for up to 90 days and detention without charge for up to 24 days. Philippine National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon told NPR that the Americans have held suspects in Afghanistan longer.

HERMOGENES ESPERON: And you keep some of them in Guantanamo - right? - for how long?

MCCARTHY: Esperon says the Philippine detention period is far less than Singapore's two-year long warrantless arrest for terrorist suspects. And his country has a genuine security threat, with militants aligned with the Islamic State and a decades' old communist insurgency.

ESPERON: We have become oblivious. We have even become desensitized of the incidents. And now they will interject the matter of human rights.

MCCARTHY: Those rights, says Carnegie Endowment's Aaron Sobel, need to be front and center as populists, like Duterte, across the globe consolidate power through anti-terror laws.

AARON SOBEL: To me, the Philippines is extremely emblematic of that. His firebrand type of speech helped him get elected. And he's used that to erode civilian checks and balances.

MCCARTHY: Attorney Colmenares says, perhaps the most disturbing in the new law is that writings, proclamations or carrying a banner could be construed as inciting to commit terrorism - a new tool, he says, to crush dissent.

COLMENARES: It chills freedom of expression. It chills free speech. It chills freedom of the press. So incitement is, in fact, directly a threat to free speech.

MCCARTHY: National Security Adviser Esperon says activism is not terrorism, and the law expressly says so. With the distrust in the government deep, Colmenares says such safeguards are fake.

190,"San Francisco: Microsoft has introduced a new platform security technology to prevent data corruption techniques being adopted by cybercriminals to target system security policy and tamper with data structures on Windows 10 devices.

Called Kernel Data Protection (KDP), the technology prevents data corruption attacks by protecting parts of the Windows kernel and drivers through virtualization-based security (VBS).

According to the company, KDP is a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that provide the ability to mark some kernel memory as read-only, preventing attackers from ever modifying protected memory.

âFor example, weâve seen attackers use signed but vulnerable drivers to attack policy data structures and install a malicious, unsigned driver. KDP mitigates such attacks by ensuring that policy data structures cannot be tampered with,â the tech giant said in a statement this week.

The concept of protecting kernel memory as read-only has valuable applications for the Windows kernel, inbox components, security products, and even third-party drivers like anti-cheat and digital rights management (DRM) software.

KDP uses technologies that are supported by default on Secured-core PCs, which implement a specific set of device requirements that apply the security best practices of isolation and minimal trust to the technologies that underpin the Windows operating system.

âIt enhances the security provided by the features that make up Secured-core PCs by adding another layer of protection for sensitive system configuration data,â said Microsoft.",nam
191,"GOP presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says America is facing many threats today, including Russia and China. However, he singled out Islamic terrorism as the most worrisome.

âI think the biggest threat todayâ¦ is Islamic terrorism, this asymmetric threat that is organized to destroy Western civilization,â Bush told the FOX Business Network. âWe should take them at their word and realize that only the United States can create a coalition to defeat them.â

While the debate over the Syrian refugee crisis continues in the U.S., Bush said he thinks a better screening process needs to be put into place.

âThere have not been any details about what the vetting process isâ¦ and so I think it's, I think it's proper to pause, to take the time to create the proper screening,â he said.

But, the presidential candidate also identified the need for America to help the refugees.

âIn the end, we have an obligation, I think, to help people,â Bush said. âAnd ultimately the way to solve this problem is American leadership in the region. We need to create safe zones inside of Syria so people don't travel to Europe and other places. We need to lead and this President refuses to do so.â

Bush added, âAnd I think taking in 800,000 refugeesâ¦ will create significant national security problems for Germany and ultimatelyâ¦ could create problems for us as well. That's why we need to create a solution to this, which is the destruction of ISIS. The only way to resolve this problem is to create a coalition, led by the United States, where we have safe havens in Syria, where we have a no-fly zone, where we lead the world to destroy ISIS and to replace Assad, so that there's peace and security in Syria, to eliminate this national security threat.â

Bush suggested the military needs more funding and a more modernized strategy.

âOur strategy should be a 21st century strategy where we focus on cyber warfare, expand the reach and power of our special operators, rebuild the Air Force and Army and Marines and Navy. Weâve allowed for the decline of American military power and we need to get back to peace through strength, which means that we have to make a commitment of spending more money over the long haul on the greatest fighting force that exists in the world but has deteriorated markedly in the last seven years.â",nam
192,"Toucan has developed a Chrome browser extension designed for anyone who wants to learn a new language but hasnât found the motivation or the time.

Once installed, the extension scans the text of any (English-language) website youâre visiting and will automatically translate some of the words into the language youâre trying to learn. If you mouse over the word, youâll see the original English word. Think of it as a browser-based version of language flashcards.

The startup was founded by CEO Taylor Nieman, CTO Shaun Merritt and CPO Brandon Dietz. Today, itâs announcing that it has raised $3 million in seed funding led by GSV Ventures, with participation from Amplifyher Ventures, Wonder Ventures, Golden Ventures, Halogen Ventures, Vitalize Ventures and strategic angel investors.

Niemanâs past roles include business development roles at Headspace (where Dietz was a senior product manager), startup studio Science and car leasing startup Fair.com (where Merritt was an iOS developer). She told me that one thing she learned from across all those experiences is âhabit formation â how hard it actually is to do anything that steals peopleâs time.â

Dietz made a similar point, arguing that while language learning software like Rosetta Stone and Duolingo has had its share of success, âItâs just such a high ask to get people to change their behavior and go to this one website,â particularly on a daily basis.

So Toucan is designed to help users learn a new language (it currently supports Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese) while they browse the web as they normally would, without having to change their behavior.

Nieman said the extension can be used to solidify and expand your vocabulary as you take digital or in-person classes. Or if youâre not taking classes, you can still use Toucan on its own, and it can help you achieve (as Dietz put it) âthat magic moment of realizing you know a few words in other peopleâs languages.â

To ensure accuracy, the company works with teams of translators, including college professors and students, while also employing natural language processing to understand the context in which words are appearing. Users can also report words that are incorrectly translated.

And Toucan is experimenting with fun ways to promote itself, including the ability to âownâ a word, so that for a week, your name appears anytime a word is translated by Toucan. In fact, the Toucan team has gifted me the word âwriterâ â but since ownership is currently free, I guess itâs not a bribe?

Eventually, the company could charge people and businesses to own (a.k.a. sponsor) certain words. In addition, users can sign up for a premium subscription that gives them access to additional vocabulary. Dietz suggested that Toucan will continue exploring different business models, but he said the team is committed to âaccessibleâ education and will keep âa large chunkâ of the offering free.

Looking ahead, Toucan is planning to add new languages and to launch browser extensions for Firefox and Safari. And eventually, Nieman said the startup could apply the same approach to other subjects, âhistory or science or math or general knowledge.â",nam

The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a new tool to detect fraudulent activity and better understand how it happens across the payments industry.

The FraudClassifier model is a set of tools and materials that create a more consistent way to classify fraud. It was developed by the Fraud Definitions Work Group.

According to the U.S. central bank, the tool will help organizations classify fraud independently of payment type, payment channel or other payment characteristics.

Payment fraud typically involves the use of stolen credentials or the exploitation of a security vulnerability in credit and debit card networks, including non-prepaid and prepaid debit card networks, the automated clearinghouse transfer system, and the check clearing system.

The overall rate of payments fraud, by value, has risen in the U.S. in recent years. And as the number of payments has risen, so too has the likelihood that a payment is fraudulent. Still, in 2018, payments fraud remained rare and represented just a fraction -- 1 percent -- of the total value of all payments.

The new tool unveiled by the Fed presents a series of questions to users, starting with who initiated the payment to determine whether it was an authorized or unauthorized user.",nam
194,"Brian Muellerâs Carrot suite of apps have become popular by sadistically pushing users into better behaviors. The latest is Carrot Hunger, an artificially intelligent calorie counter that will shame or reward you for your eating habits.

The app lets you scan food bar codes and log what youâve had for the day to keep an accurate account of what youâre stuffing your face with. It will warn you if you are about to go over your calories with an almost Dalek-like feel.

She (I asked and yes, the artificial intelligence behind Carrot Hunger is considered a lady) knows when youâve opened the fridge and will yell at you if youâve already had too much. She gets mean if you ignore her, too.

But you can bribe her for a fee. Itâs how the freemium app makes money. You make an in-app purchase to keep your minder quiet or face the wrath of a pile of ads.

Sometimes these ads are fake. Thereâs one that asks if you want fries. if you click it, it shames you for being weak. The app plants these just to taunt you.

Creator Brian Mueller says he enjoys coming up with the sometimes brutal dialogue. A former screen writer who taught himself how to design and code via online tutorials, he believes itâs the humor that works for people. âItâs not just another productivity app. Itâs done in a funny way, not just mean to be mean,â he told me.

Mueller shies away from collecting specifics on people for privacy reasons. However, the app does want to know certain things about you, such as how tall you are and whether you are male, female, or squirrel (it asks) to ascertain your daily calories.

The caloric restrictions for weight loss seem a bit austere in my opinion. I should be eating roughly 1800 calories/day to maintain my weight but around 800 if I plan to lose 2 pounds a week. Iâm no artificially intelligent weight loss manager, though.

Muellerâs not sure how effective the app is compared to what else is out there, but has heard anecdotally from people whoâve lost 5-100 pounds of weight through the method.

Mueller is also the brains behind Carrot To Do, Carrot Alarm and Carrot Fit productivity and health apps for iOS.",nam
195,"New Delhi, Nov 2 (PTI) Union minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said the government has âwalked the talkâ in its fight against corruption and the social esteem of being incorruptible has been seen in Indian society, according to an official statement.

Addressing an event here, he said the celebration of the Vigilance Awareness Week (from October 27 to November 2) is a reiteration of the governmentâs resolve to continue the crusade against corruption.

Singh also administered the integrity pledge to the officials of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and addressed the officials.

On this occasion, he launched the DARPGâs âIdeas Box on Good Governance Practices in a Pandemicâ and released social media tweets on the âBest Practices in e-governanceâ, the statement said.

The Ideas Box for crowd sourcing of ideas has been operationalised both on the DARPG as well as on the MyGov platform, it said.

Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said in 2014, there was an atmosphere of despair and disillusionment and the common man felt that there is no redemption to the cycle of corruption.

The Modi government has successfully transformed the then pervading pessimism to optimism, he said.

In pursuance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs mantra of âZero Tolerance to Corruptionâ, a number of decisive steps have been taken by the government to combat corruption, the minister said.

The Prevention of Corruption Act was amended after a gap of 30 years to make the processes more equitable and reduce opportunities for corruption, he said.

âSingh said the government has walked the talk in its fight against corruption and the social esteem of being incorruptible has been seen in Indian society,â said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.

A round table discussion on the theme âSatark Bharat, Samriddh Bharat (Vigilant India, Prosperous India)â was also held by the Department keeping in line with the activities for the occasion, it said.

The round table was addressed by former Cabinet secretaries Prabhat Kumar and Ajit Seth, former secretary Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) C Chandramouli and Secretary DARPG K Shivaji.

The round table discussion focused on key issues of preventive vigilance in the pursuit of âNaitik Bharatâ which included training in ethics of public service, social audit of ethical practices, development of measurable metrics for corruption and disproportionately high impact corruption has on governance, the statement said.

The lead discussants emphasised the need for ethics being the cornerstone of public service, importance of awareness generation in preventive vigilance, role of chief vigilance officers, adoption of integrity pacts and online portal probity and the amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act, it said.

V Srinivas, Additional Secretary, DARPG and other officials of the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances took the pledge and were present for the observance of the vigilance day activities in DARPG, according to the statement.",nam
196,"Hot on the heels of raising $20 million in Series C funding led by Japanâs Rakuten Capital, London-based money transfer service Azimo is launching a new service aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.

Dubbed â Azimo Business,â it lets SMEs across the U.K. and Europe send payments to an impressive 189 countries â including many emerging markets, which is Azimoâs traditional focus â and at a price the company claims undercuts banks by 50 percent or more.

The idea isnât just to beat the banks on fees (which is often not hard to do) but also through better technology, delivering faster transfers and a smoother UX via the Azimo mobile apps and web versions.

In a brief call, Azimo co-founder and CEO Michael Kent told me that a fully fledged business version of Azimo was something that many of the companyâs existing customers had been asking for as they wanted to expand their use of the money transfer service to the small businesses they operate, not just for sending money to family and friends in their original home country.

He also (rightly) noted that immigrants are much more likely to start their own business compared to native nationals, and that these micro and small businesses are often international in nature, such as importing or exporting specialist goods. This requires a significant amount of money transfer and exchange for things like paying suppliers and paying local salaries.

To that end, even though Azimo Business runs on the same rails as Azimoâs existing consumer service, Kent explained that there are additional regulatory requirements around anti-money laundering. This sees business users having to pass KYC and KYB checks, with Azimo ultimately needing to satisfy the regulator that it knows the beneficial owner of a business sending money.

However, the Azimo founder says that required building technology and processes to scale those checks but in a way that doesnât expose Azimo to regulatory risk or creates too many false positives that would decline customers unnecessarily.

Meanwhile (and proof that there was pent-up demand), while running in beta, Azimo Business customers on average sent six times more money than Azimoâs consumer customers. The most popular sending countries were the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and France. The most popular receiving countries were Poland, China, Singapore, Pakistan, Hong-Kong, and South Africa",nam
197,"ABC Special Agent Mark Scott has been named the Liquor Law Enforcement Agent of Year by the National Liquor Law Enforcement Association (NLLEA).

Scott has been recognized for his undercover roles in four separate investigations, which were conducted in concert with various state, local and federal law enforcement agencies. âNot only was his role integral to each investigation, but it also allowed for significant development of relationships between our agency and others,â said Special Agent in Charge for the Roanoke Region Tiffany Johnson. She nominated Scott, who serves in the Roanoke Region, for the award.

One of those investigations involved nine agencies and resulted in arrests for manufacturing and selling moonshine, as well as the rescue of more than 100 mistreated animals in the case that also revealed cockfighting violations of the Lacey Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty.

This was only one of more than 20 illegal manufacturing of moonshine investigations Scott conducted last year. âDuring his 16-year career, he has conducted more than 400 illegal whiskey investigations and assisted with hundreds of others,â Johnson said in nominating Scott for the award.

The NLLEA is a non-profit association of law enforcement personnel dedicated to the enforcement of liquor laws and regulations. The NLLEA has a membership structure that is open to all levels of persons involved in enforcing liquor laws in the United States and Canada.

Scott previously served as a member of the Virginia State Police Governorâs Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) task force for 10 years. He has worked jointly with the FBI, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Marshals on federal investigations including Operation Lightning Strike, a two-year federal and state untaxed liquor investigation. He is currently deputized as a U.S. Marshal working on a federal investigation.

Prior to working for ABC, Scott served in the Bedford County Sheriffâs Office as a deputy sheriff and corporal fill-in shift supervisor. While in the sheriffâs office, he also was a member of the Tactical Response Team and Regional Homicide Investigation task force. Scott served in the U.S. Marine Corps for four years and graduated from Liberty University with a degree in criminal justice.

As a special agent, Scott is a sworn and certified police officer vested with statewide authority of arrest for ABC violations, as well as any other Virginia criminal law violation. The ABC Bureau of Law Enforcement employs a statewide force of special agents who oversee more than 16,400 establishments licensed to sell alcohol.

ABC special agents also conduct investigations involving underage sales, fake IDs and other alcohol-related crimes including narcotics and weapons violations, tobacco smuggling, money laundering, tax fraud and counterfeiting.

During fiscal year 2013 ABC's Bureau of Law Enforcement conducted 9,832 criminal investigations, made 2,201 arrests and completed 9,050 inspections of licensed establishments. ABC was previously recognized by the NLLEA in 2002 when it received the associationâs Liquor Law Enforcement Agency of the Year Award and in 2002 and 2010 when it received Most Innovative Program Award (Military Outreach Initiative, including Military Safe Rides Home program).

The Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) is a major source of revenue for the commonwealth, contributing $1.7 billion to the general fund in the last five years. The agency currently operates 344 state stores. Its Bureau of Law Enforcement oversees 16,000 ABC licensed establishments while the Hearings and Appeals Division considers more than 700 cases each year. The agency also provides alcohol education and prevention programs for people of all ages. Now in its 80th year, ABC remains committed to progress and innovation in carrying out its control, service and revenue mission.",nam
198,"President Donald Trumpâs baseless claims that Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden are attempting to ""steal"" the election are gaining momentum on social media, plunging Facebook and Twitter into the most dangerous and volatile period since Election Day.

Goaded by prominent conservatives, Trump supporters are rallying behind election-rigging conspiracies such as #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud, even as results from battleground states put Biden on the brink of winning the presidency.

âWe expect now at this point that these narratives are going to survive the election and last for quite a long time, perhaps becoming either consolidated into existing conspiracy frameworks such as QAnon or becoming the basis of completely new conspiracy theories,â Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said in a press briefing.

QAnon manipulating voters?: Were voters manipulated by QAnon a force behind Trump's 'red wave' in 2020 election?

Twitter rules would change for Trump: Trump will be a regular citizen on Twitter when his presidency ends

âIf you look at the extent and breadth of the kind of disinformation we are seeing, it seems highly unlikely to us that this activity is going to slack off even after, say, inauguration.â

Long after the election is called, âthere will be a significant portion of people who believe the election was stolen and who will use these narratives as a basis of that belief and then will build upon it,â Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief, said.

While the volume of posts about the election is decreasing, Twitter is seeing a surge in election-related disinformation, according to Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit public interest research group which studies disinformation.

Four of the 10 most shared websites in posts about the 2020 election promoted unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud or sought to document allegations of voter fraud, the research found. #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud were among the top 10 hashtags used.

Artificial intelligence software company Yonder analyzed social media posts including the term âstop the stealâ and found that 99 of the participating accounts were created after Oct. 1 and 55 were created on Nov. 3. These new accounts dominate the volume of posts containing the term, Yonder found.

Politico reported Friday that voter fraud protests across the country are linked to major conservative activist groups and MAGA personalities such as Tea Party Patriots, Women for America First, Turning Point USA and Freedom Works USA.

Confronted with the rapid proliferation of posts and groups making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and encouraging Trump supporters to turn out at street protests, sometimes with violent overtones, Facebook responded Thursday with temporary emergency measures to restrict the spread of false and possibly dangerous content.

Facebook deployed âbreak glassâ tools to police online debate. Itâs demoting content on Facebook and Instagram, including debunked claims about voting. It is also limiting the distribution of live videos that may relate to the election.

""We have developed break-glass tools which do allow us to â if for a temporary period of time â effectively throw a blanket over a lot of content that would freely circulate on our platforms,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, told USA TODAY in September.

Earlier Thursday, Facebook shut down a fast-growing pro-Trump âStop the Stealâ group calling for ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the voteâ over âworrying calls for violence.â

The Facebook group, which attracted more than 350,000 members and nearly 7,000 posts in two days, was being used to organize protests with the rallying cry that Biden was trying to steal the election.

It was named after the hashtag weaponized by President Donald Trump and his allies to boost unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that could delegitimize a Biden win.

âIn line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group âStop the Steal,â which was creating real-world events,â Facebook said in a statement. âThe group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.â

I'm talking about insider ""trading"". This is the legal kind, when insiders buy and sell company shares.

There are a lot of different reasons that may influence why an insider is buying and if you should be following their lead.

But how do you figure out what is a good insider ""buy"" and if you should be jumping in?

The key is in the secret signals.

Insiders Will Send Signals

Investors who want to get in on insider trading can simply buy what the insiders are buying.

There are plenty of lists for ""insider buys"" put out every week. But those lists don't really tell you the full story. It's simply a bunch of names and numbers of shares.

What's the REAL story behind the buy?

As the editor of the Insider Trader portfolio, I've looked at hundreds of insider buys. Patterns emerge. Insiders often give out secret signals, but you have to know what to look for.

Here are 3 of the secret signals that I use to find the diamonds in the rough of the insider trades. Find these secret signals and insider buying will no longer seem like a mystery.

3 Secret Signals to Successful Insider Trading

1) ""The Lawyer Indicator""

The General Counsel (or ""Senior Counsel"" at some companies) is the company's top lawyer and is considered part of management. Being a lawyer myself, I can tell you that lawyers are, in general, risk averse. (Sorry lawyers!)

Therefore, when it comes to buying company stock, they usually err on the side of caution. They rarely buy shares on the open market unless they're seeing something that is really great at their company.

If you see the General Counsel buying, that is a strong secret signal. I call it ""the lawyer indicator."" Buy when the lawyers are buying.

The insider buys that get the most publicity are the famous CEOs who buy, for example, $1 million worth of shares (or more) in one massive buy.

While these big buys are great, and can mean something exciting is going on at the company, I look for the complete opposite. I look for the ""cluster"" trades, where a group of insiders are all buying at the same time.

That means, for example, there may be 3 Directors, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Marketing all buying smaller amounts of shares, but all deciding to do so around the same time. This type of cluster buying is rarer than the one big buy by the CEO and sends a powerful signal.

What do they ALL know?

3) Buy If Insiders Are Jumping in For the First Time

There are some insiders who buy company shares on the open market several times a year. Some of the senior insiders, like the CEO and CFO, are usually paid at a higher level than the other senior management and buying company shares isn't much of a hardship.

But for other senior management lower down the chain, like the General Counsel or the head of Human Resources, among others, there may be a different calculation when deciding to buy that $10,000 worth of stock.

It's not unusual to see insiders who have NOT bought shares in many years, if ever, deciding to buy some shares.

The insider who has NEVER bought shares before, but is now, sends a strong signal.

I'm not talking about someone who is new at the company. This would be an insider who has worked at the company for several years and only now has decided to jump in.

What does that insider know that is different from the prior years? Why are they buying now?

And how can you take full advantage of this buying activity?

Where to Find the Best Insider Buys

Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information for a company, but it's time consuming to literally search through hundreds of individual companies.

Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you in a weekly list. Have you ever seen one of those lists? The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.

To solve this problem, our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations. We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys to find the very best.

Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks' Insider Trader.

Right now, we've narrowed it down to 10 insider buys that make the grade.

Right now, we've narrowed down to 10 insider buys that make the grade. One recent move was from a CEO who - for the first time - poured his own money ($238,800) into his company's stock. This was despite having already received over $7 million worth of the stock as part of his compensation, yet another compelling signal.

Our strategy indicates that it's time to follow this CEO and load up on shares.

203,"(Reuters) - The top federal prosecutor in Chicago said on Friday he had designated a prosecutor in his office who will be tasked with rooting out fraud schemes in the region stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Tyler Murray, the head of the financial crimes section in the Chicago area, will now serve as a âCOVID-19 Fraud Coordinator,â said John Lausch, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

âMy office will vigilantly guard the public from fraudsters who try to take advantage of a vulnerable time for our nation,â Lausch said in a statement.

âA national crisis is by no means a safe harbor for criminal activity.â

The appointment of a prosecutor to handle coronavirus-related crimes comes after U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Monday directed federal prosecutors across the country to prioritize pursuing fraudsters seeking to exploit peoplesâ fears of the coronavirus pandemic by peddling fake cures or masquerading as government officials through phishing email schemes.

The effort comes on the heels of news that some websites, including one operated by Alex Jones of Infowars, were advertising creams, supplements and other products that claimed to cure coronavirus.

The Food and Drug Administration, as well as the New York Attorney General, has already started issuing warnings to some businesses marketing such products by ordering them to remove false or misleading advertising from their websites.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia warned of several other schemes on the rise, including the creation of fake shops, websites and social media accounts to sell medical supplies in high demand such as masks, as well as charity scams seeking to raise funds to help people impacted by the virus.

Legal experts are also bracing for a possible increase in Medicare-related fraud schemes, after the federal government recently relaxed rules for telemedicine so that people seeking medical advice from doctors can reduce face-to-face encounters as needed.

Telemedicine has been at the heart of several recent major frauds, including a scheme unveiled in September that bilked Medicare out of $2.1 billion over medically unnecessary genetic tests, as well as another $1 billion scheme last April involving medically unnecessary equipment such as back and knee braces.",nam
204,"Itâs always a good idea for investors to pay attention to insider trading to gauge the climate of company management. However, sometimes monitoring insider trading is a bit trickier than it seems when the insiders themselves are trying to keep their activities masked.

Everyoneâs heard the old adage that actions speak louder than words, and that rule is certainly true on Wall Street. Thatâs why the market often pays particularly close attention to insider trading, and large insider buys and sells can be major catalysts for a stock.

Form 4 Farming

Insiders are required by law to file Form 4 disclosures every time they make a stock trade. However, every insider sell is not necessarily an indication that thereâs something wrong inside a company. Insiders often get thousands or millions of dollars' worth of company stock as part of their compensation plans. In order to monetize those shares, insiders can set up a trading plan to routinely sell shares into the market over time.

Related Link: Why You Should Pay Attention To Insider Transactions

One way to differentiate a planned purchase or sale from a potentially spontaneous sale is to look at the transaction code on Form 4. There are 20 different codes for insider transactions. The type of transactions that most traders will be looking for are buys, with the code P, and sells, with the code S.

Transactions with the code V are voluntarily reported earlier than legally required to be disclosed. Other types of transaction codes indicate various other unique situations that may not necessarily be an indication of the fundamentals of the company. A full rundown of the Form 4 transaction codes can be found here.

Tricks Of The Trade

One thing company insiders can do to avoid tipping off the market to large buys and sells is to break them up into smaller lots. A single 1-million-share sell may set off red flags in the market, whereas 20 different 50,000 sells might fly under the radar.

Sometimes, these insiders can take it a step further to mask their large transactions. Traders may easily recognize a series of 50,000-share buys as a part of a much larger order, but if the million-share order is split into smaller orders of varying sizes, it might be more difficult to recognize the individual transactions as all being part of a larger move.

Learning By Example

Firsthand Technology Value Fund Inc (NASDAQ: SVVC) Chief Investment Officer Kevin Landis has been purchasing 1,000 shares of Firsthand stock every trading day since Oct. 17. On the first two days, Landis reported all 1,000 shares in a single trade. Since that time, Landis has broken his buys up and altered his pattern, breaking the 1,000 shares into 500/500, 600/400 and even 490/510 pairs.

Traders may look at a series of 500-share purchases in a stock such as Firsthand and think thereâs no meaningful insider action going on. After all, 500 shares of an $8 stock is only a $4,000 purchase. However, over an 11-day stretch, Landis has reported 18 different purchases totaling 10,600 shares of stock worth roughly $83,500. For a stock with a market cap of only $58 million, that type of an insider purchase might raise eyebrows in the market.

Yet if Landisâ plan was to fly under the radar, it seems to have worked to perfection. Since the stockâs close on Oct. 16, the stock has drifted mostly sideways, down 1.7 percent overall.

205,"In brief

In a recent appeal before the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon involving two individuals who had participated in public sector corruption (Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal [2020] SGHC 144), the High Court set out a new sentencing framework for corrupt transactions which take place in relation to contracts with the Government or public bodies under s 6 read with s 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the PCA).

Key takeaways

Public sector corruption (i.e. which relates to the Government or public bodies) is considered an aggravated form of corruption in Singapore because it undermines the integrity of the Government, and erodes the publicâs trust and confidence in the various organs and bodies of the State. Given Singaporeâs zero-tolerance approach to corruption, custodial sentences are presumptively the norm in cases involving public sector corruption.
The new sentencing framework pertains only to public sector corruption involving agents. The High Court declined to extend the new sentencing framework to cover all corruption offences under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA generally.
The new sentencing framework adopts a five-step analysis (please see below).

In more detail

Background

Wong was the general manager of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) at the material time, and was in charge of AMKTCâs operations, including overseeing and providing input on the selection of contractors for the execution of work. Chia was a shareholder and director of two companies which were in the business of providing construction-related works for various Town Councils in Singapore (the Companies).

From 2014 to 2016, Wong corruptly received and obtained various forms of gratification from Chia (e.g. discounts on a car, remittances to Wongâs mistress, and entertainment expenses). In return, Wong advanced the business interests of the Companies in their dealings with AMKTC by, amongst other things, preferring the tenders submitted by the Companies (even though they were not the lowest), tweaking AMKTCâs tender requirements to suit the Companiesâ specifications, and providing input and advice to Chia on the Companiesâ bid pricing and technical information.

At trial, both Wong and Chia pleaded guilty to three charges of participating in public sector corruption with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the PCA. The Public Prosecutor appealed on the basis that the sentences imposed by the District Judge were inadequate. Wong and Chia cross-appealed on the basis that the sentences imposed were excessive.

Issues

As a common law jurisdiction, the general approach towards sentencing in Singapore has always been to have regard to past cases which have identified a number of categories and factors pertinent to the sentencing process.

However, in respect of corruption cases, past decisions have tended to be of limited relevance given the Public Prosecutorâs discretion to bring charges for the basic corruption offences (under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA) even if the facts could warrant invoking the enhanced punishment provisions (under s 7 of the PCA). This has created two issues for the Singapore courts:

precedents tend to be of limited use; and
even where the facts of previous cases are similar, a high degree of caution is still required as the sentences imposed in those cases may have been under the basic corruption offences.

In the circumstances, a sentencing framework for public sector corruption is warranted so as to provide a consistent and coherent methodology for the courts when dealing with such offences going forward.

The sentencing framework

1. Identify the level of harm caused by the offence and level of culpability, having regard to the list of offence-specific factors. Accordingly, both the level of harm and level of culpability can be broadly classified into three categories scaled according to severity.

* These are non-exhaustive factors

2. Identify the applicable indicative starting range that would apply based on the level of harm and level of culpability determined in Step 1, and the following sentencing matrix:

3. Identify the appropriate indicative starting point within the sentencing range that had been chosen. This entails an examination of the offence-specific factors. This is also where the sentencing court should have regard to the public service rationale, which will typically attract a custodial sentence save for exceptional cases.

4. Make adjustments to the indicative starting point to account for offender-specific factors.

* These are non-exhaustive factors

5. Take into account the totality principle and make final adjustments to the sentence.",am
206,"Chinese exports have been in the spotlight recently, thanks to the US-China trade war that has seen enormous tariffs imposed on Chinese goods entering the US.

Transparency International has been looking at Chinaâs exports too but for a different reason, namely because of inaction against criminal activity that could skew the entire playing field of international trade which important treaties and conventions are meant to protect.

Our new report, Exporting Corruption 2018, assesses country enforcement against foreign bribery in line with obligations in the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. It classifies 44 countries into four bands of enforcement based on the data available regarding how much they investigate and prosecute companies that pay bribes to win business abroad.

Although China is not a signatory to the OECD Convention, we included it along with three other major Asian exporters â Hong Kong, India and Singapore â because, together, these four jurisdictions are responsible for more than 16 per cent of global exports.

The results show that China, the worldâs largest exporter, with over 10 per cent of global exports, is failing to enforce its own laws on foreign bribery. According to the information available, there have been no investigations or charges ever laid in China against its companies, citizens or residents for foreign corrupt practices.

At the same time, Chinese companies and individuals have been the subject of publicly reported corruption investigations and charges laid in numerous countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, the United States and Zambia.

China is not alone in its poor performance; 21 of the other countries rated also fall into the lowest enforcement category. But as the worldâs leading exporter, the practices of Chinaâs companies abroad have a significant influence on global trade practices.

If China does not enforce hard-won international standards for conducting business, competitors from countries that do enforce will find themselves disadvantaged. This may lead to a reduction in enforcement worldwide, destabilising the global marketplace and triggering a race to the bottom.

In our new report, we recommend that China become a party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, something the G20 has repeatedly called for and the OECD has been working towards for many years. Although China has an international law obligation to enforce against foreign bribery under the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), that documentâs review mechanism lacks the depth of reviews and the formal follow-up to be found in the OECD Working Group on Briberyâs review process.

In response to our recommendation, one commentator stated that for China âcorruption and whatever way they can influence other governments is, in effect, part of their foreign policyâ¦they see it as one among many tools to extend the influence of China around the world, from the Silk Road to Africa to other areas of the world.â [1]

This view is overly cynical. It is not unreasonable to expect that China will sooner or later recognise that it is not in its self-interest to conduct a foreign and trade policy that discredits the countryâs business representatives as corrupt partners. With the international community trying to pull together to combat corruption, using corruption as a tool for winning business around the world is not a winning foreign policy formula. One need only look to Malaysiaâs break with China following the change of government in that country. Or at votersâ recent rejection of the Maldivesâ corruption-accused and China-backed president in Septemberâs election.

Under President Xi Jinping, China has undertaken a robust â and controversial â anti-corruption campaign domestically, which recognises the importance of tackling bribery for the health of the countryâs economy and its institutions, but has been criticised over human rights violations. China should recognise the importance of collective efforts to combat international corruption, consistent with international human rights standards, in order to build a healthier global economy and credible institutions around the world.

If it doesnât, the biggest losers will be the great numbers of people harmed by corruption exported to their countries.",nam
207,"NEW YORK â SoftBank Group Corp.âs Vision Fund 2 is investing $100 million in compliance and employee-monitoring software company Behavox, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The investment, which is in the form of preferred shares, values Behavox at about $500 million, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

The investment group will also be represented on the companyâs board, the sources added.

The deal is among the first for the second incarnation of SoftBankâs $100 billion Vision Fund. It comes at a time when the company faces growing scrutiny from investors, including activist Elliott Management Corp., amid high-profile setbacks such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.

Behavox uses machine learning and advanced analytics software to help alert companies to potential wrongdoing among employees. The companyâs customers include SoftBank Investment Advisers, as well as banks, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms.

âThis investment will allow Behavox to further focus on and invest in the needs of our customers,â said Erkin Adylov, the firmâs founder and chief executive officer.

SoftBank Investment Advisers Managing Partner Munish Varma said Behavox is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution that will make internal communications data useful to a broad range of users, from compliance to analysis of insider threats and from archiving and data governance to CRM automation.

Adylov and key employees will remain the largest shareholders in the Behavox.

SoftBank quietly completed an initial money-raising push for its second technology fund at a fraction of its targeted $108 billion, people familiar with the matter said in November. The company raised roughly $2 billion for the second Vision Fund and was still canvassing for additional money, the people said at the time.",nam
208,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia â Construction companies face corruption risks throughout all steps of construction from submission of building permit requests until the State Committee endorses that building meets all technical requirements and standards. Corruption costs affect both small and large construction companies alike, and as a result increases the price paid by consumers. So, what are specific corruption risks at each of these stages and how can we address them? This was the main theme of the discussion held at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Mongolia on 23 November 2015 among construction companies, professional associations, and relevant government agencies.

The discussion was heated and frank, and revealed serious corruption risks and implications.The government entity granting building permits does not take any accountability for damages caused by licensed construction companies. In other words, no one checks if the construction company in question had necessary technical capacity in the first place. When buildings are found to be sub-standard, there is no accountability provision for construction inspectors, who originally signed that the building was fit for use. Lately, instead of asking for bribe money, there have been demands to own shares of construction companies in exchange for different types of permits.

Ms. Bat-otgon, Director of Prevention and Public Awareness, Independent Authority Against Corruption, noted, âCorruption was regarded as mostly related to public sector, but increasingly this is also true for the private sectorâ. Indeed, investors and owners of construction companies find that it is quite common among mid-level managers to earn money by obtaining discounted construction material, but charging non-discounted prices in formal contracts.

Finally, construction companies emphasized the importance of engaging them in development of various construction related codes and regulations.

The discussion was organized jointly by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Mongolia, the Independent Authority Against Corruption, and UNDP, as part of the 2015 International Anticorruption Day campaign.",nam
209,"One of the many debates prompted by the UKâs decision to leave the EU is its future policy on targeted sanctions. Traditionally a tool of foreign policy aimed at changing the behaviour of foreign regimes, sanctions have increasingly been used to signal disapproval and to disrupt the activities of targeted individuals and corporate entities. As an EU member, the UK has used this tool to impose asset freezes, travel bans and other restrictions on various targets, primarily to enforce EU decisions and regulations. How, will, and should this change in future?

John Binns

For many of those who make and influence policy in this area, a large part of the answer to this question is inspired by the death of the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky (pictured below) and the US law to which it led: the Global Magnitsky Act, which targets those believed responsible for human rights violations or significant corruption. UK parliamentarians and others have pressed the government to introduce a similar law here, and have succeeded in doing so, though with decidedly mixed results.

POCAâs Magnitsky clause

The UKâs first Magnitsky provision was in 2017, by way of an amendment to our Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA). The context is our scheme for civil recovery of the proceeds of âunlawful conductâ, a term the amendment expanded to include the proceeds of a âgross human rights abuse or violationâ, or conduct âconnected withâ such abuse.

Unhelpfully, the first of those terms is defined very narrowly, to mean torture (or inhuman or degrading treatment) by a public official of a person who has sought to expose illegal activity by a public official, or to defend human rights. The second term, meanwhile, is defined very broadly, to include acting as an agent in connection with such abuse, directing, sponsoring or profiting from it, or materially assisting it (which includes providing goods, services, and other financial or technological support for it).

Magnitsky sanctions in the UK

The UKâs second Magnitsky provision is in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA), which provides the framework to enable UK sanctions after it leaves the EU. It enables sanctions against those reasonably suspected of involvement in the two types of conduct described above, now confusingly grouped together under the term âgross human rights violationsâ.

The upshot of these provisions is that those who have engaged in or profited from political torture can have their assets frozen by way of the civil recovery provisions of POCA, or by way of sanctions imposed by the UK government (which might also make them subject to other restrictions, such as a travel ban), or both.

What could possibly be the problem with such an approach? In fact, there are several.

The first is that POCA already provides for the recovery of the proceeds of criminal conduct, which in most or all cases would include torture, or assisting torture. The scope of SAMLA is also very wide and empowers ministers to make sanctions for foreign policy purposes. So it is hard to see how either provision adds much or anything to what was already there.

The second is that, despite their narrow focus on political torture, the provisions have been widely misinterpreted as covering as broad a range of conduct â including other human rights abuses and significant corruption â as is covered in the US by the Global Magnitsky Act. So their introduction has led to calls from some quarters for greater use of sanctions to combat acts of financial crime and money laundering.

That in itself raises an interesting question about how the criminal and asset-freezing powers of POCA interact with financial sanctions. Is it legitimate, for instance, for a minister to freeze the assets of someone suspected of corruption â indefinitely, and without the need for any criminal or civil claim â rather than go through a POCA claim in the courts?

The third is that, for those who have campaigned for a UK law to honour the memory of Sergei Magnitsky to provide strong and public support for the causes he championed, these provisions are arguably counter-productive. They fail to do what most people would expect of a Magnitsky law, and are unnecessarily complicated and hard to understand. The message they send is far from helpful, whatever the UK chooses to do with them.

Future for UK Magnitsky sanctions

Notwithstanding these problems, the UK government has indicated that it intends to make use of the provisions in SAMLA to make its own Magnitsky sanctions, and that it considers it can do so even while it remains within the EU sanctions regime (as it will during the current extension, and any agreed transition period after that).

As and when it does so, it can realistically expect strong challenges to such measures from two directions. The first is from any designated persons who are suspected of (for instance) assisting or profiting from torture and wish to challenge that in the courts. The second is from those who will inevitably see the measures taken as too narrowly focused, and who will continue to demand action the provisions do not currently allow. Both challenges will doubtless prompt a rethink.",nam

211,"In India, you donât really exist till youâre on the right WhatsApp groups. Itâs on those private chat rooms that political campaigns are sharpest; where Indiaâs sprawling extended families quarrel and make decisions; and, according to a recent Reuters investigation, where company quarterly results are predicted with surprising prescience. Thereâs no proof of insider trading yet, but officials from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi -- Indiaâs market regulator -- told the Economic Times that they were looking into the reports.

This is just another reminder of the fact that, while nominally Indiaâs financial markets are set up to protect ordinary investors and market participants, in actual fact they work to protect insiders. This isn't generally understood, given that Indiaâs laws against insider trading and protecting minority shareholders are strict on paper. In the World Bankâs ease of doing business indicators, for example, one of the few domains in which India has consistently done well is in the protection of minority shareholders.

But here, as elsewhere in India, thereâs a vast difference between what the laws say and how they're implemented. Indeed, Indiaâs Supreme Court recently chastised regulators, saying that their rules on insider trading simply werenât clear enough.

The WhatsApp story seems to confirm something of an open secret in Mumbai stock market circles: There are closed networks that tend to get information about companies well before the general public. Sebi struggles to get insider-trading prosecutions off the ground. Meanwhile, foreign investors operating in India are being forced to run investigations of their own local employees and contractors.

Even if Sebiâs regulations were up-to-date and detailed, enforcement would be hampered by staffing problems. The agency has only 780 employees, one for every six companies listed on an Indian stock exchange. (Fifteen times as many people work at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one for every company listed on an American exchange.) Nor does the training or background of Sebiâs employees necessarily inspire confidence.

Add to that a culture that has long normalized trading on insider information. I remember sitting, a few years ago, with an acquaintance of mine from one of Mumbaiâs old stock-broking families, a man then in his late 50s. We were talking of the prosecution in New York for insider trading of Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group LLC, and of Rajat Gupta, once a managing director at McKinsey & Co. Inc. After I carefully explained what Gupta and Rajaratnam had done, my acquaintance shook his head, bemused. How, he asked me, are traders expected to make money except by using their networks to unearth information nobody else has? Itâs no surprise, perhaps, that many ordinary Indians donât entirely trust the stock market, assuming it's loaded against them in some way.

A similar insider-first entitlement has led to an even larger corporate governance problem. What in India are called âpromotersâ -- those who control companies, frequently the firm's founding family -- have power far beyond what their actual ownership share warrants. They pay themselves exorbitant salaries, strip the publicly-held companies they control of assets, and have their decisions rubber-stamped by boards and sometimes even by shareholder meetings that donât have all the information.

After a couple of corporate scandals recently, Sebi set up a committee led by the well-respected banker Uday Kotak to investigate how governance could be improved. Kotak explicitly said that he saw his job as ensuring âfairness for the entire body of shareholders"" and not just a select subset. The committeeâs report called for multiple changes to how companies were regulated and how boards were constituted.

But it isnât that easy to make changes in India. At least one government minister said that the report was âcompletely off the mark."" And preventing insiders from taking control of companies would require Sebi to investigate the privately-held, or unlisted, subsidiaries of publicly-traded companies. Sebi doesnât have that power and it isnât certain that the Delhi ministry that does will give it up easily.

Kotak pointed out another open secret about the Indian private sector, too: Most activity at many publicly-traded companies was nominally carried out by unlisted subsidiaries -- and so wasnât audited, or transparent enough for the average shareholder to figure out. He could easily have added that some promoters tend to use unlisted subsidiaries to hide their control and to move money around in ways that shareholders or the government canât see.

Indiaâs government is hoping that more and more of its citizens will turn to the financial markets and shares as a vehicle for their savings, giving up on gold and on real estate. And, certainly, the marketsâ bull run has been one of the few good news stories in the Indian economy at the moment. But to keep that run going, India has to work harder to protect outsiders -- or, to put it another way, it will have to work harder to disempower insiders, by streamlining laws if necessary. Bureaucratic wrangling between regulators and the government shouldnât stand in the way.

212,"Lucy DâOrsi, national policing lead for protective security, stressed that the national terror threat level remains at substantial, meaning an attack is likely.

She said: âAs a senior officer in counter terrorism it is my responsibility to share with the public where we see the current threat position.

âAnd what we see is that it is no different, it is still at substantial, so it is no different to where it was prior to lockdown.

âAs we come out of lockdown, I think it is really important to remind people that the threat level from terrorism remains at substantial, which means an attack is likely.â

The three-year anniversaries of the terror attacks at London Bridge and Manchester Arena fell within the last three weeks.

The Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner said: âWeâre all going to look forward to going back to crowded places, iconic locations.

âI would just really ask that people stay alert as they were before.

âIt was only in the last couple of weeks when weâve been reflecting on London Bridge three years ago, Manchester Arena three years ago.

âWe just need the public to stay alert and play their part in national security, to create a hostile environment for terrorists to operate in.â

During lockdown, terrorist propaganda has shifted to focus on sowing divisions in society, she said, with one example being far-right groups falsely claiming that Muslims had broken lockdown rules at mosques.

In April Chief Superintendent Nik Adams, national co-ordinator of Government anti-extremism scheme Prevent, warned of a potential rise in the risk of radicalisation as people spent more time online and socially isolated.

At the same time, the number of referrals to Prevent had dropped.

Ms DâOrsi said: âThere is a risk of radicalisation. Weâve adjusted some of our work in terms of stepping up the online work that we do.

âWeâve seen evidence that there has been a change in propaganda, which is seeking to divide communities, and I absolutely believe that communities defeat terrorism, so ensuring that the propaganda isnât believed and the communities arenât divided has really been important.â

Roque admitted that this was not the first time the President offered to resign, saying he has expressed frustration that corruption remained rampant in government. He maintained that the President has âzero toleranceâ for corruption, citing his efforts to clean up the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.

Asked if the President was serious in his resignation offer, Roque said: âLetâs just say heâs serious about his expression of exasperation with corruption.â

In his televised address Monday night, the President bared that he has offered to resign because he was fed up with corruption in government. Citing his long experience in public service, Duterte admitted it was difficult to eliminate corruption.

The President, in the same remarks, disclosed plans to enhance the anti-corruption efforts. He said he was ready to appear before Congress to discuss ways to âcut corruptionâ and simplify government rules to promote the ease of doing business in the country. He said he has an âalmost radicalâ plan against corruption.

On PhilHealth, Duterte said he would propose to Congress the abolition of the state health corporation which has been hounded by corruption allegations. He said a new agency will created âout of the ruins of the old one.â",nam

215,"Vividly portrayed in films from The Godfather to The Sweeney, the idea of criminal enforcement using threats, intimidation, assault and murder has long been an established underworld practice.

Despite the widespread cultural fascination with this shadowy part of society, there is little in the way of academic work that explores the role of enforcers.

My latest research with colleagues from Scotland and the US consisted of interviewing underworld figures from two parts of the UK â the West Scotland and the West Midlands, to further explore the nature and extent of this phenomenon.

In popular culture, the criminal enforcer conjures up images of machismo, allure, brute force and professionalism. In the fictional world, enforcement activities like debt collecting or extortion seemingly take place within the night-time economy, in pubs, clubs and casinos.

Also in media portrayals in news and on television, the preferred mode of communication seems to be violence â a constant presence in organised crime. My previous research on organised crime argues that violence can be used strategically by a crime outfit to start, maintain or advance a criminal enterprise. But to what extent is this the case for enforcement out on the streets of our towns and cities?

Becoming an enforcer

The West of Scotland and West Midlands have long histories of organised crime â both places are major hubs for illicit drugs. Through a comparative study we gained extensive insights into a number of areas including how people become enforcers; how contact is made between all parties involved; the costing arrangements; and the degree of planning involved.

In the study, a criminal enforcer was defined as any member or associate of a criminal organisation who acts illegally to achieve his ends. Essentially the enforcer is someone who settles a dispute to get âjusticeâ for his employer, such as a debt that is owed.

Itâs 100% social. You need to have that name. Everybody needs to know that youâre the person who collects the debts. Often, you gain that criminal reputation and respect from the work that youâve put in, the prison time that youâve done.

This was a response from John, an ex-military private investigator, when asked whether strong social connections are required to be a successful enforcer. Social capital, according to John, underscores the saying: âItâs not what you know, itâs who you knowâ. So this view is not exclusive to the legitimate world and makes clear the importance of being known and being seen on the streets when it comes to underworld enterprises.

The economics of enforcement

Researchers who have explored the economics of crime and punishment tend to examine how offenders calculate things: the practicalities and money offered by a legal income; the income potential of illicit methods; the probability of being arrested for criminal behaviour and the likely punishment if convicted.

Aaron, who has previously worked as a debt collector for several crime groups, alludes to the good money that is associated with enforcement:

â¦ Sometimes the lender will tell you to get back his money and you will get a percentage. Iâve been involved in situations where individuals have had to pay back the money with interest. In these cases Iâve been told by the lender to take a percentage from the money heâs owed and whatever else heâs charged on top.

Interestingly, Aaron did not seem to factor in the probability of being arrested in his calculations. This should not be mistaken for foolishness, as enforcers are rational and sophisticated in their planning and carrying out of illegal work.

Planning and acting

Popular culture often portrays enforcement as a physically violent endeavour. According to Theo, a convicted offender, violence is not necessarily good for business:

Iâve been part of situations where itâs been a âcriminal figureâ who dealt with a legitimate company that owed him moneyâ¦ I didnât go in with tools [weapons]. Itâs because I was dealing with normal nine-to-five people, who would happily call the policeâ¦ Youâre better off reasoning with them and having a conversation.

Theoâs approach to violence is dependent on the circumstances of the debtor. Enforcement, in relation to debt collecting, is not a process that is exclusive to underworld operatives. His approach of âreasoningâ with normal everyday people (as opposed to other criminals) implies logic, which is much needed when retrieving owed money.

Overall, our study suggests that nuanced enforcement practices is an alternative form of criminal justice that is woven into the fabric of any provision of illicit goods or services. Yet, it is a criminal activity that is overlooked in national debates due to limited academic research.

Certain kinds of occupation often facilitate criminal behaviour like enforcing, such as a military background. Future research would help establish potential links between previous occupations and becoming involved in the enforcer business for organised crime, whether using lethal or non-lethal approaches. Clearly there is nuance there that is rarely explored in popular police and mafia dramas.",nam
216,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) â Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said Wednesday that a large oil refinery suffered a âterrorist attackâ as his government struggles to provide domestic fuel to the nation amid a historic political and economic crisis.

Maduro spoke at a nationally televised news conference, touching on a wide range of topics that included his country's deep ties with Iran and opening a probe into the secret departure of a leading political adversary, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who recently fled after being holed up for months in the Spanish ambassador's residence.

Maduro gave few details of the alleged attack Tuesday that he said toppled a large tower at the Amuay Refinery on Venezuelaâs northern Caribbean coast. He said it was carried out with a âlarge and powerfulâ weapon, which was still under investigation.

The president also said two foreigners tied to extremist groups were detained a day prior to the incident with plans to kill Venezuelan leaders. Maduro did not identify the them, give their nationality or explain whether they had ties to the refinery attack.

This follows the arrest a month earlier in the same part of Venezuela of a U.S. citizen, Matthew John Heath, who Maduro has labelled a CIA spy. He has been charged with terrorism, weapons trafficking and conspiracy.

âVenezuela is confronting a permanent conspiracy against our life, against our strategic industry, against the electricity service, the refinery, the oil industry, public services,â Maduro said.

Venezuela has been in an economic crisis, which critics blame on two decades of failed socialist policies that have left the nation bankrupt and its infrastructure crumbling. Maduro says he is under attack from Washington, which wants to oust him from power.

Venezuela was once a wealthy oil nation, but its broken refineries fail to produce enough fuel for drivers to fuel up their cars. Venezuela in recent months has begun importing gasoline from Iran, another nation that has been hit with U.S. sanctions.

In the Heath case, the American was arrested while in a car with three Venezuelans â National Guard Sgt. Major Darwin Urdaneta, Marcos GarcÃ©s and Daeven RodrÃ­guez. The three Venezuelans have been charged with treason, terrorism, arms trafficking and conspiracy.

Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab has said investigators seized from the vehicle a grenade launcher, a submachine gun, suspected plastic explosives and bundles of dollars.

The alleged attack on the refinery Tuesday comes amid a long and bitter relationship with the United States, which has imposed heavy sanctions on Maduro. The U.S. has also indicted him as an purported narcoterrorist, putting a $15-million reward for his arrest.

Washington backs opposition leader Juan Guaido, who claimed presidential powers in early 2019 as head of the National Assembly. A coalition of more than 50 nations recognize him, saying Maduro clings to power after an undemocratic election.

Maduro, who spoke for nearly two hours, said Venezuela and Iran share â³deep, spiritual, politicalâ ties, but he denied that he is buying weapons from Tehran, despite recent reports. He didn't dismiss the possibility of doing so in the future.

âIt seems like a very good idea to buy missiles from Iran,â Maduro said. âWhen the time is right, weâll consider it.â

Maduro also said authorities in his government are launching a legal probe into who is responsible for helping LÃ³pez, among Venezuela's most popular opposition figures, sneak from the Spanish ambassador's residence in Caracas over the weekend and reappear in Madrid, to rejoin his wife and children.

LÃ³pez was sentenced in 2015 to nearly 14 years in prison after being convicted of inciting violence during anti-government protests. He was released from a military prison in 2018 but last year he broke his house arrest to join GuaidÃ³ in a failed military uprising aimed at ousting Maduro.

LÃ³pez spent the last 18 months in the Spanish ambassador's residence, out of Maduro's grasp. Maduro said Wednesday that there was a ""negotiationâ between LÃ³pez and the Spanish government to realize his surprise departure.

Maduro also attacked Spain's outgoing ambassador to Caracas, JesÃºs Silva, whom he called a âracistâ and a âcoup plotter,â accusing him of being linked to failed raid on the coast in May that led to the arrest of several dozen rebel Venezuelan fighters and two former ex-U.S. special forces soldiers, now jailed in Venezuela.

Silva is expected to leave Venezuela next week at the end of his diplomatic tenure in Venezuela. Maduro said he was willing to provide Silva with a plane to leave the country.

LÃ³pez on Tuesday spoke publicly in Madrid for the first time since leaving Venezuela. He denied there were any negotiations for his clandestine departure.

âOnly five people knew about it, nobody else, not even my wife,â he said. âI organized it with the people who helped me and whom Iâm going to protect.â",nam
217,"Flightcaster, Prismatic and now Merlon Intelligence. Bradford Cross, partner at the venture capital firm Data Collective is a known figure in the ranks of VCs who have caught the entrepreneurship bug, abandoning what could have been a cushy lifestyle for one with considerably more volatility. His third startup, Merlon Intelligence, services banks, helping them cut down on risk and put a stop to money laundering. Merlon is announcing $7.65 million in seed financing led by none other than Data Collective.

The Merlon Intelligence platform flags and ranks risky transactions for banks. This requires both a top level prediction model and a robust data extraction and enhancement pipeline. Merlon crawls PDFs and other unstructured text to create a graph of financial and contextual knowledge.

A natural language processing system enriches this information and allows separate predictive models to make connections between events and people. That predictive model outputs a rank of suspicious activity that can then be analyzed by a human. Traditional banking analysts can provide feedback and improve the functioning of the entire system.

With a pedigree consisting of both finance and machine learning experience, Cross hopes to best legacy players like Oracle and Lexus Nexus that rely on outdated technology while getting the jump on newer entrants like Palantir that are bogged down by clunky consulting operations.

In an interview, Cross explained to me just how big of a problem money laundering is for banks. The smallest of compliance slip-ups can cost banks millions of dollars â fines across the industry are expected to surpass $20 billion this year.

Startups are really only as good as the money they save their customers. A simultaneously massive and rapidly increasing regulatory burden on banks is a surefire signal that financial institutions are willing to spend significant capital to abate burdensome fines.

Large banks employ thousands of screeners that spend their days combing through false positives flagged by existing tools. Even small improvements in transaction monitoring can save analysts time and make them more effective at managing risk.

With this as a driver, Cross was able to run a proof of concept test for a major bank within six months. That deal, worth seven figures, took about a year to convert to contract.

âA big challenge as youâre starting to scale is getting your sales process moving things through repeatably,â Cross told me in a very VC tone. âWeâre about to close our second bank and I would like us to do a bank a quarter.â

Rather than price gouge banks, Merlon is taking a page from Bloomberg and charging its customers on a per seat basis. The goal is that as Merlon adds new features, it will become useful to more employees at a bank, necessitating additional seats.

Cross told explained to me that the alternative of charging enterprises for individual features has generated resentment in the industry â customers donât have much power and either have to pay up or swallow a painful switch to a new provider.

Merlon uses anonymized bank data to improve its functioning. Cross says this hasnât been a concern for his initial customers because the startup never actually exports data. Ideally improved monitoring benefits every bank equally.

Moving forward, Cross says he will remain involved in the Data Collective network, helping out where he can. But with a growing startup under his wing, he will have to step back from the investing team to keep his creation on a healthy trajectory.

The team was intentional about soliciting investors that could add value in helping the startup lock down enterprise contracts with banks. In addition to Data Collective, Merlon Intelligence also counts Fenway Summer, Nyca, and Work-Bench as investors.",nam
218,"Over the last few weeks all eyes in the crypto world have been glued to the halvening, a nigh-religious moment in the blockchain realm. Every once in a while, the amount of new bitcoin mined â distributed to miners, the folks with fleets of computers powering bitcoinâs database, or blockchain â is cut in half. Why does that matter? It slows the rate at which new bitcoin is introduced to the world as the cryptocurrency marches toward its 21 million coin cap.

Thatâs to say that, while you werenât looking, the world of digital tokens and currencies has marched along, maturing to some degree as cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based services settle into slightly more predictable trading ranges.

The companies working in the crypto space are growing up as well, building out better, more sophisticated tooling for retail and institutional investors alike. FalconX is one such company, and today it announced that it has raised $17 million to date.

The crypto trading service â more on what it does in a moment â is backed by a legion of investors including Fidelity-affiliated Avon Ventures, corporate shop Coinbase Ventures, and a host of more traditional players including Lightspeed, Flybridge, Accel, Fenbushi, and Accomplice. Normally weâd curtail the list of investors to merely the most interesting, but in this case it felt reasonable to include them all, as the sheer number of capital shops that put up money for FalconX details that there is still niche and mainstream venture interest in at least some crypto-focused companies.

FalconX is also a company that anyone can understand, which probably helped. The companyâs tech helps provide pricing information for cryptocurrencies, offering what it calls the âbestâ price for a period of time (seconds). That might sound somewhat simple, but itâs not; the crypto world is made up of a host of exchanges, is awash with fake trading volume and has a history of being pushed around by large accounts. To be able to offer a price, and hold onto it, is material.

The company is currently focused on institutional customers, which the companyâs founders Raghu Yarlagadda and Prabhakar Reddy loosely described to TechCrunch as those with $10 million AUM (assets under management) and up. This likely makes KYC (know your customers) rules easier for the startup to follow.

FalconX makes money from trading fees, albeit in two ways. It offers either crypto prices with its fees included or on a fixed-fee model. Notably the firm says that crypto-native customers prefer the baked-in approach, while more traditional customers prefer the visible-fee method.

Either way, FalconXâs tech has found an audience. It has executed $7 billion in trading volume in the last 10 months (I asked about the seemingly odd time interval, which the firm explained as its most recent, fully-audited time period; it has seen more total volume during its life.)

That $7 billion volume result is likely why FalconX was able to attract external capital. And the fact that the startup appears to care about treating crypto seriously and not as a way to get around traditional banking regulations.

For example, after FalconX brought up anti-money laundering work during a discussion about regulation, TechCrunch asked the company how far it can look into its transactions to make sure that it isnât accidentally helping bad folks get money. Yarlagadda responded, saying that âthe future of regulationâ in his space is âsolving some of these problems and showing [them] to the [regulatory] agencies so that they get comfortable about the space.â

How is FalconX going about that? It uses âinternal on-chain analyticsâ as well as third-parties to help get âcontext [into] which Bitcoin addresses, or Ethereum addresses, are associated with dark web or terrorist activitiesâ to make sure that its trades are not winding up helping the wrong folks. This isnât easy; the startup has to look through âsix, seven hopsâ so that it can see if any money that goes through its service is suspect.

That seems pretty good, right? I found it impressive. Even more, after Yarlagadda joked that itâs not cheap to pay for the computing power needed to pull off that work, FalconX told TechCrunch that the expense counts as COGS. Neat!

Thereâs a fine line when covering anything blockchain-related between producing something that regular folks can understand, and writing something that the crypto-believing world wonât dismiss out of hand as insufficiently nuanced. Summing then, in case I swung too far towards the latter, FalconX built a pricing engine that allows big investors to make trades with more confidence. It gets paid when they trade and is processing lots of volume. That means its revenues are going up. And thatâs why it raised more money.

The next question for FalconX is how fast it can scale volume. The faster it can, the more enticing it will prove to investors. And in time, if it does open up to more retail-sized traders, who knows, it could even become a household name.

219,"Crime statistics from the South African Police Service show that gang related murders are increasing sharply, particularly in the suburbs that make up the Cape Flats in the Western Cape. The area is the epicentre of gang activity in the country. One in every five of the 3 729 people murdered in the province between April 2017 and March 2018 were the victims of gangs.

Los Angeles in the US has a comparable gang problem. But even it has had a lower rate of gang related murders in the past three years.

Last year I concluded the first comprehensive analysis of the main law designed to deal with gang related crimes. I specifically looked at Chapter 4 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act to investigate the shortcomings of the legislation in combating gang related crimes.

My analysis uncovered several shortcomings â including issues such as sentencing and the fact that the law falls short of being specific on gang related crimes â that frustrate the prosecution and conviction of gangs.

Research findings

I found that the stateâs failure to protect the inhabitants of the Cape Flats can in great part be attributed to the failure of Chapter 4 of the law, which was enacted in 1999 to combat organised crime. That includes gang related crime.

One of the biggest problems is that the law doesnât have the power to disrupt gangsâ structures and capabilities. This is partly due to weak sentences for gang related crimes. They range between three and six years, mostly with the option of a fine. The sentences are ineffectual in deterring gang members and are also too short to disrupt the organisational structure of the gangs.

My research also highlighted the fact that low sentences were often given to high-ranking gang members or bosses, on whose orders the offences such as drug dealing, assault, robbery or murder are often committed.

This issue is worsened because the Prevention of Organised Crime Act doesnât contain any offence that is specifically aimed at gang leaders. The closest it comes to targeting them is through the provision for the crime of inducing another to commit gang activities. This carries a maximum sentence of three years, or an unspecified fine.

This is in stark contrast to crimes pertaining to managing criminal racketeering enterprises. These offences carry a R100 million fine or life imprisonment.

A further issue is that proving crimes were committed on the instruction of gang leaders is extremely difficult. Thatâs because gang leaders are mostly far removed from the actual crimes, which are executed by their subordinates. Thereâs often no evidence linking the leaders to the actual crimes, making it practically impossible for the state to prove their involvement beyond a reasonable doubt in trials.

Prosecutions based on the act are often derailed due to a lack of evidence, also because of the complex nature of the crimes.

Ineffective policing

The Western Cape government has been very vocal in claiming successes in its fight against gangs. For example, it claimed last August that its anti-crime operation had made over â11,000 arrests including high-ranking gang members on the Cape Flatsâ. This seems exorbitant, considering that the total number of people awaiting trial in the entire country during 2016 and 2017 was about 43 799.

But the public should be weary of this misleading language. Arrests donât translate into prosecutions; and prosecutions donât translate into convictions. In fact, Helen Zille, the Premier of the Western Cape, criticised the low 0,7% gang conviction rate two years ago.

The gang crisis is aggravated by the shortage of police officers in the country. In 2015 it was reported that about 85% of South African police stations were understaffed.

Another problem is the unfair allocation of police resources. In December 2018, the Equality Court found that the allocation of police resources unfairly discriminated âagainst black and poor people on the basis of race and povertyâ. Many of those under-served areas are rife with gang activity.

What can be done?

The law needs to change to provide for crimes that are simpler to prove, and include provisions that specifically target gang leaders. This should be coupled with harsher sentences.

Ensuring that gang leaders are directly accountable for the crimes committed by their subordinates would solve the problem in providing evidence in court that the crimes were committed on the bossesâ instructions. Proof that the boss controls the gang, for instance, would be enough to secure a conviction. Such models are recognised under international criminal law.

A controversial option, akin to Australiaâs New South Wales model, would be to outlaw the formation of gangs and membership. This might, however, lead to the infringement of the constitutional right to freedom of association.

None of the necessary changes will happen without real political will. The establishment of the Anti-Gang Unit in the Western Cape in late 2018 was a step in the right direction. But its true value will be reflected in actual convictions for gang-related crimes.",nam
220,"UK banks achieved the biggest reduction in card fraud losses last year among 18 countries across Europe, according to the latest FICO European Fraud Map.

More than half of the countries saw increases in card fraud losses in 2019 according to the report, based on data from Euromonitor International and UK Finance.

âFollowing a frustrating increase in 2018 â largely caused by an explosion of data compromise âbust outâ events â much of Europe has once again turned the tide on fraudsters, achieving a combined 2% overall reduction,â said Toby Carlin, director of fraud consulting, EMEA, at FICO.

221,"PASAY CITY, Oct. 29 -- Senator Christopher âBongâ Go has expressed his support for proposed measures that aim to strengthen anti-money laundering efforts in the Philippines in compliance with the legal standards set by concerned international bodies.

During a Senate Committee on Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies hearing on Wednesday, October 28, Go echoed the calls of President Rodrigo Duterte and Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III to strengthen efforts against money laundering in the country through the proposed Senate Bill 1412 and its counterpart House Bill 6174.

Go noted that Duterte has certified the proposed measure as urgent.
âI echo the Presidentâs call to comply with legal standards for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing, as established by relevant international bodies,â Go said during the hearing.

The proposed measures seek to strengthen Republic Act 9160 or the âAnti-Money Laundering Act of 2001â, making the country compliant with the legal standards set by international bodies in addressing money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities.

Go cited that just last March, the Bureau of Customs confirmed that $370 million in dirty money entered the country. According to the DOF, two groups allegedly laundered around $167.97 million and $200.24 million, respectively.

In response, Dominguez ordered the BOC to work with the Anti-Money Laundering Council in investigating the entry into the country of dirty money.

In the hearing, Go also expressed his support for the inclusion of tax crimes and violation of the Strategic Trade and Management Act, which indirectly includes proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as predicate to money laundering.
Moreover, Go said that the swift passage of the measure will also benefit overseas Filipino workers.
âPossible na sila po ang direktang maapektuhan dahil kapag hindi po na-amend ang ating Anti-Money Laundering Law, maaari pong ma grey list ang Pilipinas ng Financial Action Task Force at tumaas ang cost ng remittance rates para sa ating mga OFWs,â he said.
âNararapat lamang po na maglaan tayo ng sapat na proteksyon upang mapangalagaan ang kapakanan ng ating mga kababayan. Our campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs,â he added.
Ending his statement, Go emphasized that strengthening laws against money laundering will boost the governmentâs fight against criminality.

âOur campaign has always been against criminality and corruption aside from the war on illegal drugs. Amidst the continuing pandemic that has hampered, not just the economy but also the lives of our brothers and sisters, criminality and corruption have become more important issues that we must take seriously,â said Go.

âAt the time when our people are experiencing unprecedented hardships, every single centavo counts. Make no mistake, tutuluyan talaga namin ni Presidente ang mga manloloko at magnanakaw,â he added.

Go also stressed that he and Duterte have always adopted a firm opposition against any form of terrorism.

âWe are one in our vision to exterminate terrorism and improve our anti-terrorism efforts,â he said.

âDapat po putulin at hadlangan ang lahat ng kahit anumang makakatulong sa mga teroristang walang ibang ginagawa kundi manggulo lang po sa ating bayan,â he ended. (OSBG)",nam

Regxsa has got the help of Romanian software development company Fortech for the launch of this Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution.

âThe concept behind Alexis is to enhance the capability of investigators to take decisions.

Alexisâ innovative approach is to process large datasets efficiently and present them in an interactive multi-layered visual interface,â adds Mihai Soroceanu, Alexis Tech Lead at Fortech.

The solution has a scalable infrastructure and firms can choose where they want to store their data.

223,"Alex Stamos rose to fame as the chief security officer for Yahoo and then Facebook. But today heâs the director of Stanfordâs Internet Observatory, where heâs immersed in teaching and researching safe tech â and understands better than most the threats that the U.S. is facing, particularly as we sail toward the next U.S. presidential election.

Last night, at a StrictlyVC event in San Francisco, he talked with New York Times cybersecurity correspondent Sheera Frenkel about a small number of these massively impactful issues, first by revisiting what happened during the 2016 president election, then catching up the audience on whether the countryâs defenses have evolved since. (The short version: they havenât. If thereâs any good news at all, itâs that the federal and state governments are at least aware now thereâs an issue, whereas they appeared largely blindsided by it the last time around.)

What worries Stamos most are âdirect attacks on our election infrastructureâ because thereâs been so little to bolster it. In fact, a big theme of the interview was the growing inability of the public sector to protect Americans or U.S. democracy against actors who would do the country harm.

As it relates to election infrastructure specifically, Stamos used a hyperlocal example to underscore what the U.S. is dealing with right now. As he told Frenkel, âI live in San Mateo County. Iâve met the CIO of San Mateo County. Really nice guy. Iâm sure he has a staff of very hard-working people. The idea that the CIO of San Mateo County has to stand up and protect himself against the [Russian military intelligence agency known as the] GRU or Chinaâs Ministry of State Security or Iranâs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Lazarus Group of North Korea . . . thatâs frickinâ ridiculous. Like, we donât ask the San Mateo County Sheriffâs Department to get ready to repel an invasion by the Peopleâs Liberation Army, but we ask for the cyber equivalent in the United States.â

Put into perspective, San Mateo County is one of about 10,000 local governments in the United States that are involved in elections, said Stamos. âNobody else in the world runs their elections this way.â

In fact, in nearly every conceivable way, âresponsibilities that were once clearly public sector responsibilities are now private sector responsibilities,â he told Frenkel during a later part of their discussion. He would know, having seen it first-hand.

âWhen I was the chief security officer at Facebook,â he told the audience, âI had a child safety team. We probably put more bad guys away than almost any law enforcement agency outside of the FBI or [Homeland Security Investigations unit] in the child safety realm. Like, thereâs no local police department in the United States that put away more child predators than the Facebook child safety team. That is a crazy stat.â

Facebook also has a counter-terrorism team â which not everyone realizes â and which has become in many ways the countryâs first responder, he suggested. Indeed, Stamos said that âthere are several terrorist attacks that youâve never heard of because they didnât happen because we caught them. Now, thereâs some local law enforcement agency that took credit for it, but it was actually our team that found it and turned it over to them with a bow on it.â

Americans might shrug off this continuing shift in who is tackling what, but they do it at their peril, suggested Stamos â who managed to keep the crowd laughing, even as he painted a bleak picture. As he noted, the big tech âcompanies are exercising this power without any kind of democratic oversight.â Consider, he said, that â[Facebookâs] authorization is the terms of service that people click through and never read when they join Facebook or Instagram. Thatâs a bizarre set of rules to be bound by when you have such incredible power.â

Another huge blind spot, said Stamos, is the apparent inability â as well as the collective lack of determination required â of the public and the increasingly powerful private sector to coordinate their work. Here, he offered another broad example to make it accessible. âSay you had an organized group in the United States thatâs running a bunch of Facebook ads, but their money is coming from bitcoin from St. Petersburg,â said Stamos. âThat is completely invisible to Facebook. That is perhaps visible to the FBI . . . but they donât have access to that actual content [on FB]. And figuring out a way for these two groups to work with each other without massively violating the privacy of everybody on the platform turns out to be super hard.â

Yet itâs worse than even that sounds, he continued. The reason: thereâs no decision-tree in part because the issue has grown so unmanageable that no one wants to own what goes awry. âThereâs effectively nobody in charge of this right now, which is one of the scariest things weâre facing as a country. Almost nobody is in defense of cyber, and certainly nobody is in charge of the big picture, [meaning] how do we defend against election [interference] both from a cybersecurity perspective and a disinformation perspective.â

Stamos even jokingly referred to âpockets of people in the U.S. government who are effectively hiding from the White House and trying very, very hardâ to escape its attention, given the daunting job theyâd be tasked with figuring out. Except, all kidding aside, with no one at the helm and âno real cross-agency process, thereâs really nobody in charge,â said Stamos.

That means the âtech companies are effectively the coordinating body for this. And thatâs actually really screwed up.â",nam
224,"Ukraineâs Constitutional Court appears to have again struck a blow against efforts to properly fight corruption. This time it has reportedly declared unconstitutional Article 366-1 of the Criminal Code which imposes criminal liability for providing knowingly false information in income declarations. Although the judgment from the Grand Chamber of the Constitutional Court [CCU] has only been announced, not published, Fedir Venislavsky, President Volodymyr Zelenskyâs Representative at the CCU, has told RBC that he understands the Court revoked (by declaring unconstitutional) criminal liability for false income declarations, but not for illicit enrichment. It also revoked the right of the National Agency on Corruption Prevention [NACP] to monitor income and expenditure of judges. Asked whether the rulings would endanger Ukraineâs European integration in generation and the visa-free regime in particular, Venislavsky replied that he could not rule out adverse consequences if the Courtâs actions continue in this direction.

Judging by a tweet on 27 October from Matti Maasikas, the EU Ambassador in Ukraine, EU representatives have made this abundantly clear, though whether they have averted the danger remains to be seen. The Ambassador reports a â Fruitful EU Delegation and US Embassy in Kyiv meeting with the Chairman of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. We discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, including the importance of the transparency and of maintaining the achievements since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. â

The veiled threat could not be more obvious, however the dangers were surely clear even before the judgement was reported, albeit in this highly unsatisfactory manner. As of late on 27 October, there have been strong responses from, among others President Zelenskyâs Office and the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, without any real certainty as to which specific norms were declared unconstitutional. Venislavskyâs report differs radically from that of former MP Serhiy Leshchenko who reported on Tuesday that CCU had voted to revoke Article 366-1 of the Criminal Code, but also illicit enrichment (presumably meaning liability for this); electronic declarations and the powers of NACP.

CCU reported earlier in October that the Grand Chamber would, on 8 October, be considering a submission from 47 MPs received in August this year. The MPs asked CCU to consider the constitutionality of a number of norms in anti-corruption legislation, including the Criminal Code; the Law on Fighting Corruption and On the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, or NABU.

The statement on its site on 27 October states that a judgement has been passed, which takes legal force as soon as it is adopted, but does not actually specify what it was.

One of the norms the 47 MPs clearly wanted removed, via a decision on its unconstitutionality, was that on criminal liability for illicit enrichment.

Back on 26 February 2019, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional Article 368-2 of Ukraineâs Criminal Code which imposed criminal liability for â the obtaining by an individual carrying out functions of state or local self-government of significant assets, where it had not been proven that these were lawfully obtained â, i.e. illicit enrichment. Importantly, the norm also envisaged liability where the official has handed over the ownership to another individual, with this a standard method of concealing illicit profits. The Court claimed that the norm â does not meet the requirements of being clear, precise and unambiguous â, as set out in the Constitution (a criticism that can be levelled at countless other laws which are not declared unconstitutional). The Court also asserted that Article 368-2 does not comply with the constitutional principles of the presumption of innocence, citing Article 62 of the Constitution which states that âno one is obliged to prove his / her innocenceâ . The move elicited outrage and consternation, and was finally rectified with a new law criminalizing illicit enrichment coming into force on 28 November 2019.

Although the submission from 47 MPs is generally called âthe case on illicit enrichmentâ, the main thing that seems fairly certain is that CCU has revoked criminal liability for false declarations.

NACP responded to this with a blistering statement entitled âCorrupt practices prevail in Ukraine at the highest levelâ and accusing CCU judges of passing a judgement in their own interest. The Agency notes that it had found indications of false information in the declarations of two judges â Iryna Zavhorodna and Serhiy Holovaty. This means that the two judges had a conflict of interest and should not have taken part in considering the submission.

There is effectively no point to demanding income declarations from public officials if the latter can lie with impunity. Former President Viktor Yanukovych for at least two years running declared millions in âroyaltiesâ, although nobody could track down the books these were supposed to be for. Most politicians and other officials declared extremely modest earnings, yet flaunted expensive watches, drove the most expensive cars and went on hugely expensive holidays abroad. This has included judges, some of whom were found by investigative journalists to have âpassed judgementsâ while basking in the sunshine abroad.

It has taken years to get criminal liability introduced, and it will be a disaster if this has been revoked. Nor does it help that the judgement comes at a time when the appalling revelations of judicial corruption have not received adequate response. Although the main judges implicated are the president of the District Administrative Court in Kyiv, Pavlo Vovk, his deputy and some others, NABU investigators accuse Vovk of exerting influence on other courts as well. In tapes that NABU has made public, a voice that appears to be Vovkâs can be hearing boasting that âtwo courts belong to us, the Constitutional Court and the District Administrative Court.â",nam
225,"European interior ministers have pushed the fight against terrorism to the top of their agenda following last monthâs attacks in Paris, Nice and Vienna.

In a joint statement issued on the fifth anniversary of the November 13 attacks in France, the interior ministers pledged to work towards the faster removal of terrorist content from social media networks.

They agreed to finalise negotiations on regulations for removing terrorist content by the end of the year.

""The aim is to enable issuing removal orders with cross-border effect to create a new and rapid and effective instrument to counter terrorist content online within an hour or less of its being reported, while maintaining effective safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights,"" the ministers said in the statement.

They also agreed to reinforce external borders, stating: ""We want to strengthen and further develop options for security measures within the Schengen area as well as instruments for cross-border law enforcement cooperation.""

There have already been a number of operational reinforcements to Schengen including the creation of European border guards, Yves Pascouau, from the think tank Res Publica, told Euronews earlier this week.

A strengthened role for Interpol in intelligence sharing is among the ideas that were being discussed in the virtual meeting hosted by European Commissioner Ylva Johansson.

Ministers will present ""comprehensive Council conclusions on internal security and on a European police partnership"" in December, the joint statement issued on Friday stated.

""We need to do even more to protect our European values, our European society and our European citizens,"" said Johansson. âThey want us to do more and to cooperate more and I think this is necessary.â

226,"ABU DHABI, 20th October, 2020 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Justice has called upon law firms to take all necessary measures to ensure anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing obligations are respected.

Law firms were also asked to take the necessary legal measures against offenders under Federal Decree 20 of 2018 in relation to money laundering, its executive regulations, and relevant ministerial decisions as part of the UAE's efforts to address the risks associated with financial crimes.

The Ministry emphasised the importance of law firms' role in combating money laundering, as well as the need for lawyers to assume their role in fighting this crime and identifying risks, handling clients, reporting suspicious transactions, and maintaining proper records.

The Ministry announced that it had recently taken legal action against non-compliant lawyers as part of controls and procedures in this regard, including the decision to suspend 200 law firms from practicing for one month due to non-compliance with established procedures to combat money laundering.

The Ministry noted that penalties included the suspension and cancellation of professional licences, as well as the imposition of administrative fines ranging from 50,000 to 5 million dirhams.

In recent months, the Ministry of Justice has asked all registered lawyers to access the ""Smart Lawyer"" system on the Ministry's website (elawyer.moj.gov.ae), or to contact the Ministryâs money laundering department to update their information in Arabic and English, appoint a compliance officer for each office, and fill out questionnaires relating to procedural compliance. They were also directed through various official media and social media outlets to take all necessary measures to avoid administrative penalties.

The Ministry explained that the suspension of law firms would be lifted once lawyers in charge of the department's legal management office prove that they have carried out procedures to fulfill their obligations under Ministerial Resolution 533 of 2019 on combating money laundering.

The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is of utmost priority for the UAE, with a Ministerial Higher Committee overseeing the National Strategy on Anti-Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism being established under the chairmanship of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.",nam
227,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has a ""red flag"" feature, which serves up a ""ping"" whenever an individual or business has been suspected of having fraudulent activity conducted against their name or if their account has been compromised.

Facing Senate Estimates on Tuesday, ATO client engagement second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn explained that this ping was effectively a caveat on taxpayers' affairs.

While Hirschhorn said there was no increase in fraudulent activity that could be directly tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said his teams have been very focused on fraud this year.

""Obviously there are new mechanisms of potential fraud across all the programs. We have found -- I have previously testified to the level of fraud in the ERS program, which is at about 0.3% of applications on our country, which is a very, very low level of fraud. We have also been looking at JobKeeper and Cashflow Boost and have not found systemic fraud,"" he said.

""We have found that there have been some individual opportunistic frauds but we have not identified a high level of fraud and part of that was the design feature of the measures which were designed to be available only to those who have a good lodgement and tax history, which made it harder for people to resurrect dormant entities.""

On the reports of fraud related to the federal government's early access super scheme, Hirschhorn said the ATO has received a variety of suspicious matter reports from Austrac. But he also said there has been an increase of data breach-related fraud.

""There has also been a spate of -- you know, when an organisation has its payroll data, amongst other data hacked, there have been a few hackings of companies which have meant that we have put more red flags on identity files,"" he said.

In Australia, the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme requires agencies and organisations that are covered by the Privacy Act to notify individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in ""serious harm"", as soon as practicable after becoming aware of a breach.

In general terms, an eligible data breach refers to the unauthorised access, loss, or disclosure of personal information that could cause serious harm to the individual whose personal information has been compromised.

In its last report, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner revealed the total number of reported data breaches in Australia for the 2019-20 financial year was 1,050.

For the six months spanning January to June 2020, 518 breaches were notified under the NDB scheme. 124 of those breaches occurred during May, the most reported in any calendar month since the scheme began in February 2018.

Most of these were attributed to human error.

229,"MEXICO CITY â MEXICO CITY (AP) â Mexico's president proposed tough new anti-money laundering rules Thursday to bar cash purchases of any real estate in pesos and cash purchases of cars, planes and other goods for amounts exceeding 100,000 pesos ($7,700).

Prodded by concerns that drug traffickers launder as much as $10 billion each year through banks, exchange houses, businesses and purchases of luxury goods, the government in June imposed its strictest limits ever on transactions in U.S. dollars.

The package of laws that President Felipe Calderon announced he will send to Congress proposes similar limits on cash peso transactions, a large part of the economy in a country where many people work under the table and don't use banks.

""The criminals, the killers, the kidnappers, those who traffic people and drugs, pass themselves off as prosperous businessmen,"" Calderon said at a ceremony announcing the proposal. ""They buy mansions and luxury vehicles; they set up businesses or buy them to serve as front companies.""

Calderon's challenge is to target the larger, suspicious peso transactions while not choking off legitimate activity in Mexico's still-recovering economy. Many companies on the border have complained that the limits on dollar exchanges has hurt the flow of business from Americans and others who buy medicines and other goods in border cities.

Ignacio Deschamps, president of the Association of Mexican Banks, said there had been a 35 percent drop in cash dollar deposits by businesses in recent months as a result of the rules announced by the government in June.

Calderon acknowledged that the limits ""will force us to change many of our own habits, and our way of looking at and acting in the economic life of the country.""

Studies estimate as many as 40 percent of Mexicans work off-the-books as street vendors, artisans or domestic employees.

But the proposals are focused to limit large cash transactions on goods most Mexicans probably could not afford: big houses, new cars, airplanes, boats, expensive jewelry and large lots of lottery tickets.

At present, many Mexican business shun large cash purchases as suspicious, but they are still technically legal. The country's real estate and auto dealers associations say cash transactions represent a tiny percentage of their business.

Calderon has been under pressure to come up with new ways to fight the drug cartels, whose bloody turf battles have resulted in the deaths of more than 28,000 people since his administration launched a military-led offensive in late 2006.

The opposition-dominated Congress must approve the package.

Raul Benitez, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who studies the drug trade, called the measure ""an important step, but now the issue is how the banks receive deposits, and how they receive cash deposits.""

Mexico already imposes a 2 percent tax on cash deposits in an effort to regulate such transactions, but drug cartels are often willing to spend much more than that to launder money.

Benitez said the cartels may turn more to businessmen whose companies have large cash flows as a way to launder drug money.

""They are going to broaden their support network through businessmen and store owners, because they have bank accounts,"" Benitez noted. ""Of course they will have to pay them a percentage, but they are going to try to get around it that way.""

The new rules would also require betting parlors, debit card issuers, automotive bulletproofing shops, lawyers, accountants and jewelers to report suspicious transactions. The package also proposes jail sentences for transactions carried out in violation of the rules.",nam
230,"The fraud prevention start-up SEON, has announced its partnership with Patreon, the leading membership platform home to over 200,000 creators. The platform will be utilising SEONâs unique fraud prevention solution to help fight fraud and abuse on the platform supported by more than 6 million active patrons.

Launched in 2013, Patreon empowers membership businesses for creators by giving them the tools needed to acquire, manage, and energize their paying patrons and recently achieved unicorn status. The company follows a subscription-style payment model, where fans pay their favourite creators a monthly amount of their choice in exchange for exclusive access, extra content, or a closer look into their creative journey. However, while the internet has opened up new possibilities for creators to expand their audiences and to share their works, it comes with its challenges, such as internet breaches and the selling of data on the dark web.

By integrating SEONs solution via an API or chrome extension, Patreon will have near-immediate access to SEONâs services and will be able to skip the long integration times experienced when it comes to most fraud prevention tools. The company will have instant access to rich data taken from the email, phone number or IP addresses it gathers from customers, while also collecting all accessible data points about customersâ digital footprints from social media profiles, available via open sources in the public domain. This allows Patreon to identify which users are genuine and which accounts are fraudulent, protecting its customers and creators from online fraud.

Jacqueline Hart, Trust & Safety at Patreon, said: âWe were impressed with the amount of information SEON could provide on an email address to give us comfort in whom we are doing business with. Being able to give enriched data and save the step of having a human chase down the information on a customer was a step up for us in our fight against fraud and abuse.â

Patreon will integrate SEONâs tool alongside its existing fraud solutions, ensuring a fully optimised payment experience by maximising payment acceptance and minimising declines based on having the most up-to-date information. Whatâs more, SEONâs processes take place in real-time and entirely in the back-end so patrons wonât experience any additional friction during the payment process, while security is bolstered.

Tamas Kadar, CEO and Founder at SEON, commented: âWhen we created SEON, we made it our mission to fight fraud differently from existing technologies, in Patreon we found a customer with the same disruptive spirit. Patreon saw the value of how it makes life easier for its fraud team to safeguard transactions and have round-the-clock access to a platform which contains all the information needed to fight fraud.â",nam
231,"President Martin Vizcarra has succeeded in channeling public outrage as he pushes Sunday's vote as an essential decree to ""end the plague of corruption.""

Peruvians showed strong support in a referendum on Sunday for political and judicial reforms introduced by the new President Martin Vizcarra to target corruption in one of Latin America's most promising economies, according to an exit poll.

The proposed reforms were announced in August following a series of corruption scandals involving high-ranking officials and politicians, and were reluctantly approved by a unicameral congress dominated by the opposition.

A total of 24.3 million eligible Peruvians were registered to vote on proposals including the regulation of political party financing, and the overhaul of the appointments system for judges and prosecutors, that were spurred in part by an influence-trafficking scandal in July.

According to an exit poll conducted by Ipsos Peru for private station America Television, 87.1 per cent approved regulating the financing of political parties, while 85.0 percent approved of judicial reform.

A third proposal, to ban the immediate re-election of lawmakers after a five-year term, was backed by 85.2 per cent of voters.

But a fourth, which proposed creating a second chamber in congress, was rejected by 85.1 percent, according to the exit poll, which said it had a 5.5 per cent margin of error.

Vizcarra had backed all the proposed reforms except the latter, which he said had been ""distorted"" at the last minute by members of the current congress who he said had sought to seize legislative control from the executive in favor of the new chambers of deputies and senators.

Participation in the referendum was mandatory, under penalty of a fine.

Vizcarra took office in March after the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski amid accusations of corruption.

If the exit poll results are confirmed, it will be a big political victory for Vizcarra over the powerful Conservative opposition led by former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori. She was detained in October in connection with allegations that her party received cash from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht for its 2011 campaign.

""Today Peru won. We have a lot of work to do to bring well-being to all Peruvians,"" Vizcarra wrote on Twitter late on Sunday. ""The task is great, but we have the strength and commitment backed by all to put Peru first.""",nam

Outside crimes of passion like murder, the typical motivating factor for criminals, criminal organizations, kleptocrats and some businesses and corporations is greed. It is an intrinsic part of the human condition and in todayâs increasingly interconnected world, the manifestations of unconstrained criminal acquisitions are felt on all levels of society â politically, socially, economically and even culturally. The effects are pernicious, undermining the economic and political stability of countries as inequality swells in nations around the world.

On the local level, people can see the impact of greed on their communities. In the United States, the opioid, methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine epidemics have been devastating. Currently, gang violence, financial fraud, the proliferation of counterfeit goods, fraud in government contracting, corruption, identity theft, social benefits fraud, internet scams and ransomware attacks and a plethora of other crimes affecting daily lives. The individual human costs are staggering. Collectively, this criminal greed is taking a massive toll on societal values and norms.

Law enforcement, policymakers and the media often get distracted with the immediacy of criminal behavior. With 60-second video clips on the evening news discussing the lurid details of sex trafficking, families torn apart by drugs or gang violence, citizens and politicians become alarmed. Law enforcement reacts and cracks down, but the criminal organizations re-group and move on. Itâs a vicious cycle.

Financial crimes and abusive tax evasion practiced by elites also contribute to the deterioration of societal relations. Worldwide, distrust in financial elites has reached an apex, coupled with (if not driven by) a multiple high-level corruption scandals and a corresponding absence of accountability. Corruption is a great facilitator. Increasing anger and systematic inequality are common themes in both advanced and developing economies.

The range and magnitude of transnational organized criminal activity that generates illicit financial flows are increasing. For example, human trafficking, wildlife trafficking, intellectual property rights violations, weapons proliferation, environmental and natural resource degradation and exploitation are all unfortunate indicators of greed that are facilitated by our increasingly globalized world.

Common sense, criminal science and criminals themselves all point that the aim of these activities is not the crime itself â but the proceeds of crime. Criminals and criminal organizations do not traffic in narcotics, people and weapons for the sake of the criminal act. They do not engage in scams and fraud to make innocents suffer. Elephants are not being slaughtered in Africa for bloodlust. They engage in illegal behavior because of the money the criminal actions generate. When notorious bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he pursued his chosen career, he reportedly replied, âI rob banks because thatâs where the money is.â The same is true for organized crime groups. They engage in crime for the money. Itâs a simple truism, but it is often overlooked.

Fifty years ago, following the announcement of the âWar on Drugs,â the US Congress started passing a series of laws buttressed by rules and regulations designed to promote financial transparency and aid criminal investigators to follow the dirty money trails. Today, about 19 million pieces of financial intelligence are filed by financial institutions and money service businesses every year with the US Department of Treasury. Financial transparency reporting requirements are now mandatory in many countries around the world, and yet, these and other countermeasures have proven ineffective in controlling the laundering of dirty money.

Money laundering is the hiding or disguising of the proceeds of any form of criminal activity. The keyword in the definition is âany.â It is much more than simply narcotics trafficking. The United States recognizes hundreds of predicate offenses or specified unlawful activities to charge money laundering. The international standard is âall serious crimes.â

In round numbers, the proceeds of international crime (excluding tax evasion) generate about US$4 trillion a year. Out of that amount, domestic and international law enforcement recover less than one percent. Meanwhile, government and industry anti-money laundering countermeasures and compliance programs cost in multi-tens of billions of dollars every year â far more than is being recovered. Examining the data, Raymond Baker, Founding President of Global Financial Integrity (GFI), commented âTotal failure is just a decimal point away.â

In addition to forfeitures, the other metric that matters is money laundering convictions. The numbers vary greatly around the world, but the bottom line is that for a money launderer to be caught and convicted in the United States and most other countries, he or she is either very stupid or very unlucky. For example, the United States has the most robust twentieth-century anti-money laundering program in the world, and yet criminals are able to continue exploiting money laundering methodologies based on trade. Bulk cash smuggling remains one of the top three money laundering methods.

The twenty-first century poses ever greater challenges due to advancements in technology and transnational quality of actors. Global commercial and informational connectivity increasingly permit a lucrative criminal economy. Quantum cloud encryption may revolutionize business, but it may also revolutionize criminal activity. Social media and encryption are being used by criminal organizations. The current rate of data creation has us doubling the worldâs data every two years. There is a concurrent revolution in advanced analytics. In other words, we are enjoying technological developments, but so are criminals and other nefarious actors.

There is reason for hope. Congress is starting to realize that our anti-money laundering countermeasures are not effective. This is exemplified by bipartisan legislation promoted by the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition, GFI and other actors to update federal anti-money laundering laws and end the incorporation of anonymous companies in the United States. Yet, even if that modest step is enacted, we continue to have our work cut out for us. As Ron Pol, a respected anti-money laundering researcher said, âAnti-money laundering [legislation] is the least effective of any anti-crime measure, anywhere.â Thatâs a powerful statement and, unfortunately, one that rings true.

It is long overdue to fundamentally re-think the entire US anti-money laundering strategy. Hard won lessons point the way forward. Increasing data, transparency and harnessing the incredible advances in technology can help improve tracking and monitoring mechanisms. An emphasis on following the money and seizing criminal assets, rather than focusing on products and participants would also go a long way. Additionally, individuals, criminal organizations, businesses and even countries that cheat and engage in illicit activity must be held accountable. The uncontrolled hemorrhaging of illicit financial flows and scarce capital from developing countries that exacerbates social, political and economic tensions must be combatted with renewed global and national commitment and coordination.

By making progress in seizing the proceeds of crime, advancements can be made in diminishing the rising levels of anger and feelings of helplessness, injustice and inequality so many of the worldâs citizens are experiencing today. What could matter more?",nam
233,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.N, the country's largest lender, is stepping up payment fraud protections for its small and mid-sized business customers, which continue to be targeted by scammers - particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Four-in-five small and mid-sized companies say they were targets of payment fraud last year, but that could be reduced if businesses use more tools to detect suspicious payments early, JPMorgan executives told Reuters.

The bankâs new self-service âfraud hub,â being introduced on Monday, will allow them to set alerts for unusually large payments and control who gets paid. The service supplements the current system in which customers call the bank to set controls.

âFraud is a major concern and can be devastating for businesses,â said Jennifer Roberts, chief executive of Chase Business Banking. âWe want to provide them with safeguards that are easy to set up and customize for their transactions.â

The measures come amid a broader industry campaign to get businesses to be more vigilant against a major source of payment fraud: legitimate-looking emails, often impersonating the chief executive, with bogus instructions for paying suppliers or other third parties.

These email scams cost companies $1.7 billion last year, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and have been on the rise as fraudsters attempt to exploit uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

While big companies are frequent targets of scammers, smaller companies tend to be more vulnerable because they have less sophisticated internal controls.

To help small businesses spot vulnerabilities, the bank is offering to add a âsafety meterâ to customer account dashboards which graphically shows how they score on setting safeguards, including suspicious transaction alerts.

Since the advent of paper checks, banks have encouraged customers to take steps to thwart fraud. That remains important because about 40% of business-to-business payments are still made by check, according to the Association for Financial Professionals.

But the move toward fast digital payments has increased the need for much stronger controls, said Jennifer Barker, a wholesale payments executive at JPMorgan. For JPMorgan, less fraud should make for happier customers and save the bank the cost and hassle of having to recover funds.",nam

Last among the 30 was Italy, with a score of 1.77.

Since that study was published, reduced I.R.S. funding has led to significant reductions in tax compliance in the United States, the Treasury Department reports. But these reductions are only the beginning. It takes time for people realize the extent to which others are evading taxes. And once that happens, compliance will fall much more rapidly.

235,"MOSCOW â Russiaâs Investigative Committee said Monday that prosecutors had cleared a police investigator of any wrongdoing in the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, whose death in pre-trial detention is viewed as a test of countryâs law enforcement and judicial systems.

Mr. Magnitsky, 37, who had been arrested after accusing police investigators of a huge tax fraud, died in a prison clinic after complaining for days about acute abdominal pain and untreated pancreatitis.

Central decisions about Mr. Magnitskyâs medical treatment were made by Oleg F. Silchenko, the lead investigator in the case against him, who transferred him to a prison with minimal medical facilities despite a serious diagnosis. He also authorized Mr. Magnitskyâs arrest on tax evasion charges, detained him for 11 months as a flight risk and refused repeated requests for a follow-up ultrasound that had been prescribed by a doctor.

Mr. Silchenko has long been viewed as the most likely target of a prosecution.

William F. Browder, a prominent investor in Russiaâs stock market who had employed Mr. Magnitsky as outside counsel when he was arrested, said that Mondayâs announcement suggested that no one ultimately would be held responsible for Mr. Magnitskyâs death.

âWhat this signals is that the administration has finally taken a position, which is that they are going to whitewash the whole thing,â he said. âThere were all kinds of conflicting statements, but now it seems they have decided on a party line, which is that nobody did anything wrong.â

The statement from the Investigative Committee makes a point, however, of noting that its own investigators are still working on a separate inquiry into medical aspects of Mr. Magnitskyâs death. That inquiry, which has been extended until Aug. 24, aims to learn the circumstances of his death and whether it was related to his detention and living conditions.

An independent commission ordered by the Kremlin, whose preliminary results were made public in late April, found that the charges against Mr. Magnitsky were fabricated and that police investigators whom he had accused of corruption were improperly involved in his prosecution.

Valery V. Borshchev, the head of the commission, said that a full report would be submitted to President Dmitri A. Medvedev during the summer, and that the president could demand a new investigation.

âIt is in his power,â Mr. Borshchev said. âThis is not the end yet.â",nam
236,"Refinitiv has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Giact Systems, LLC (âGIACTâ) boosting Refinitivâs existing risk and compliance capabilities with the addition of an industry leader in digital identity, payments verification and fraud prevention.

The acquisition of GIACT comes at a time when organisations are challenged by the rapid growth in digitalization accelerated by the emergence of new fraud threats, global connectivity and world events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. These factors are forcing improvements to fraud prevention and compliance procedures, as well as a move towards more holistic solutions for digital identity verification, fraud prevention and anti-money laundering.

GIACT has grown rapidly since it was founded in Texas in 2004 and now has over 100 employees supporting more than 1,000 leading blue-chip companies, payment merchants, financial and insurance customers. GIACT enables organizations across the United States to combat payments fraud, account takeovers and identity theft, which facilitates faster and more secure transactions.

GIACTâs platform approach and unique analytics enable risk insights to be generated from the aggregation of proprietary and extensive third-party data sources. The platform enables customers to identify potential fraud related risk in real time for hundreds of millions of transactions across the customer lifecycle. Its platform is designed to provide a seamless digital experience for customers by ensuring that only high-risk transactions are flagged for attention, a critical element in effectively meeting Know Your Customer obligations and in the adoption of digital payments and services.

Refinitiv will integrate GIACTâs offerings into its risk and compliance business, alongside leading products and services including World-Check, Qual-ID and its recently expanded Enhanced Due Diligence service.

The addition of GIACTâs fraud prevention capabilities brings new offerings to Refinitivâs customers by enhancing and broadening Refinitivâs digital identity verification and document proofing solution, Qual-ID. GIACTâs extensive US data assets and Refinitivâs international identity data provide customers a global platform to address identity theft. Customers will also benefit from access to GIACTâs platform alongside Refinitivâs World-Check risk intelligence data, offering an end-to-end fraud prevention, identity verification and compliance platform that addresses money-laundering risks in addition to preventing monetary loss through fraud.

âThe nature of financial crime, including fraud tactics is rapidly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. This presents significant challenges for organizations as they embrace online transactions and digital onboarding of customers,â said Phil Cotter, Managing Director, Risk at Refinitiv. âWith the addition of GIACT, we can bring customers a comprehensive platform to address fraud, identity theft, money-laundering and payment-related crimes. Iâm excited at the prospect of combining the expansive data sets, powerful analytics and human expertise of both organisations to the benefit of our customers, and I look forward to welcoming GIACT to Refinitiv.â

âRefinitiv has a strong global presence and a clear vision of how to respond to the growing demand from customers in the risk and compliance space,â said Melissa Townsley-Solis, co-founder and CEO at GIACT. âThrough this combination, Refinitiv and GIACT will bring to market a unique platform that can address the complete customer lifecycle, regardless of industry, marking an industry first. Weâre thrilled that GIACT will be part of that vision and we look forward to the next phase of growth for our business.â

237,"Promoting the engagement of the youth against corruption in Jordan and Lebanon

The Anti-Corruption and Integrity in the Arab Countries (ACIAC) regional project cooperated with the UNDP Country Offices in Jordan and Lebanon to raise the awareness of the youth and promote their constructive engagement against corruption.

In Jordan, UNDP worked with the University of Jordan and the Anti-Corruption Commission to engage students in the commemoration of the International Anti-Corruption Day under the slogan of âJordanâs Youth against Corruptionâ. The campaign was structured around a contest for students to formulate and share messages that represent their views on corruption in Jordan. To that effect, a preparatory session was held at the University, with more than 600 students in attendance, providing them with background information on the contest and raising their awareness on related concepts and issues.

With 23 submissions, including caricatures, slogans, poems and articles, the results of the contest were announced on 9 December at a major commemorative event that was held at the University. It was attended by more than 800 participants including students and senior representatives from governmental and non-governmental bodies. The event featured official statements by the organizing partners and contributions by students including presentations of related poems and acting scenes and recitations of the Holy Quran. The campaign was accompanied by strong media coverage, namely through the national television and the University Campus Radio.

In Lebanon, UNDP worked with six university teachers to engage their students, hailing from various disciplines, in a series of outreach activities that were held in five leading universities including the Lebanese University, the American University of Beirut, the Antonine University, the Haigazian University and the Notre Dame University of Louaize. The activities reached more than 450 students, raising their awareness on corruption and the roles of the different stakeholders in confronting it, while also enhancing their own capacities to engage in constructive action against it.

Those activities culminated in a main commemoration event that was held in Beirut on 18 December, with more than 120 participants in attendance including students and senior representatives from governmental and non-governmental bodies. The event featured official statements and student presentations followed by an interactive discussion with a high-level panel comprising the Minister of Justice, a key parliamentarian and leading civil society representatives. The campaign was also active on social media and received strong coverage by news agencies and local television networks.

In both countries, key stakeholders agreed to replicate and scale up related activities in 2016 to reach more students and promote more sustainable platforms for dialogue between the youth and key decision-makers and reform advocates.

Linking anti-corruption to sustainable development in Tunisia

In Tunisia, the ACIAC regional project worked with UNDP Tunisia to hold a special session on the linkages between anti-corruption and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely SDG 16 on âPeace, Justice and Strong Institutionsâ.

The event, which took place on 9 December, came as part of a national event held by the Country Office in partnership with the Government and the National Anti-Corruption Authority in commemoration of the International Anti-Corruption Day.

More than 50 participants joined the special session and were introduced to the SDGs and its added value as another international framework that promotes concrete action against corruption. They were enabled to develop a deeper understanding of their countryâs commitments under the SDGs, and to identify avenues of collaboration to share and produce more reliable data on the progress of anti-corruption efforts in Tunisia, noting their dissatisfaction with the results achieved so far.

At the end, participants formed a network that would act as a participatory platform for monitoring the efforts aimed at implementing SDG 16 and the national anti-corruption strategy, which is expected to be completed in 2016. This would be based on a joint effort to formulate and propose specific indicators at various levels; collect and share existing data; and advocate the production of new data wherever needed.",nam
238,"Ad-based platforms can face a lot of heat from advertisers when they canât control how and where their ads run: just look back to the ad boycott against Facebook earlier this year (or earlier boycotts against YouTube and others) as examples of when it all goes wrong. One of the ways this is getting addressed is with tech; and today, DoubleVerify, one of the companies that has been building tools to improve how those two interplay together, is announcing that it has closed a monster round of $350 million to continue with that work.

DoubleVerify provides tools to advertisers and brands, marketplaces and publishers â longtime customers include the likes of Facebook, which provides it as a tool for advertising clients to use in their analytics dashboard. Its tech can detect fraud (essentially verifying that you are paying for actual people, not bots, to see your ads), âviewabilityâ (making sure ads are in formats that donât go wonky depending on devices and so on), and brand safety (eg, making sure your soda pop ad is not running as a preroll to a Covid conspiracy video).

The round is being led by Tiger Global, with Fidelity, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, and funds advised by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers LLC also participating, among others. DoubleVerify says that Providence Equity Partners, which took a controlling stake in the company in 2017, remains the majority investor. It is not disclosing its valuation but in 2017, the Providence investment valued it at $300 million, according to PitchBook data.

The company said that this new investment â which it expects to close in Q4 2020 â will primarily be used for secondary purposes, purchasing shares from existing shareholders, with part also going to investing in the business itself in newer areas of business such as connected TV analytics.

âThe support of these high caliber investors speaks to DoubleVerifyâs momentum, including new customer growth, product innovation and global expansion,â said Mark Zagorski, CEO of DoubleVerify, in a statement. Zagorski joined the company in July of this year, having previously been at the Rubicon Project.

DoubleVerifyâs rise comes at a key moment in the world of online media.

Sites built on the complementary streams of advertising and user-generated/shared content have been navigating tricky waters, especially in recent times with the proliferation of misinformation related to Covid-19, the US elections, and increasing unrest over social issues like racism.

Those sites want traffic and engagement to continue growing, but that also means â especially these days â coming up against controversial material that raises the hackles of brands and other ad customers who donât want to be associated with it.

While sites continue to try to hone their terms and conditions and content policies, and policing tactics, the whole situation continually feels like a leaky bucket, with iffy material always coming through regardless (and thatâs before you consider the pesky presence of bots on on these platforms, which not only turn the wheels of virality and activity but, yes, count as âviewersâ of ads).

Groups like DoubleVerify serve â pardon the pun â a double purpose. They are both there to provide more visibility and control for brands and the platforms themselves; but they also can be held up by the parties as an example of best-effort investments, using third-party sources to improve the quality of what the companies themselves are doing firsthand.

âWe look forward to partnering with Mark and the entire DoubleVerify management team as the Company continues the growth of its business globally,â said John Curtius, Partner, Tiger Global, in a statement.

Brand safety and the related areas here are starting to get increasing focus with the proliferation of problematic content, and advertisersâ backlash against it. Others that have invested in tools to address it have included Oracle, AppLovin, and Cheq, among others.

âThe DoubleVerify team has consistently executed across all levels of the business,â added Davis Noell, senior MD at Providence and chairman of DoubleVerifyâs board, in a statement. âWe welcome the investment by Tiger and these other premier investment firms, and we are excited to continue to support the Company.â

239,"Definition: Insider trading is defined as a malpractice wherein trade of a company's securities is undertaken by people who by virtue of their work have access to the otherwise non public information which can be crucial for making investment decisions.

Description: When insiders, e.g. key employees or executives who have access to the strategic information about the company, use the same for trading in the company's stocks or securities, it is called insider trading and is highly discouraged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to promote fair trading in the market for the benefit of the common investor.

Insider trading is an unfair practice, wherein the other stock holders are at a great disadvantage due to lack of important insider non-public information. However, in certain cases if the information has been made public, in a way that all concerned investors have access to it, that will not be a case of illegal insider trading.

But thereâs room for hope: 86.3 percent of interviewees stressed that paying a bribe as unjustifiable, according to the same survey. In recent years Latin Americans have increasingly demanded more accountable, open and transparent governments that can readily respond to citizensâ needs. In this context, adopting transparency and accountability practices and mechanisms are essential create trust, dialogue and cooperation between institutions, private sector and civil society. These are necessary steps to boost institutions and public authoritiesâ legitimacy.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Latin America and the Caribbean has been enhancing the capacity of governments, civil society and the private sector in designing and implementing tools to improve transparency and accountabilityâessential for the regionâs democratic governance.

The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and in particularly SDG 16, explicitly link good governance with peace, justice and inclusive societies, emphasizing crisis prevention mechanisms and transparency as crucial steps for strong institutions. Empowering and promoting citizen participation is key. In our region we particularly focus on youth, women, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants, whoâin spite of the progressâstill lag behind, including in terms of political participation.But there are some innovative initiatives out there.For example, in Colombia, UNDP has supported the construction process of the Comprehensive Anti-Corruption Public Policy, in order to strengthen the tools and mechanisms to prevent, investigate and punish corruption. Working at a local level â or with a âterritorial policy approachââ we have partnered with 12 regional departments, working with state and non-stake actors to include the population in decision-making processes.

Peru UNDP has a Transparency and Ethics in Public Institutions initiative with the Peruvian Press Council which encourages institutions at all government levels to comply with the Transparency and Access to Information Law. We train officials, promote citizen oversight and accountability. This project is conducted with special emphasis on Municipalities and Regional Governments to introduce the concepts and practices of open government, which encourages that citizens access documents and government proceeding, enabling effective public oversight, among other matters.
Costa Rica, our âTransparency and Accountability in the Associations of Rural Water Supplyâ initiative has influenced the management of drinking water and sanitation at the local level, with results seen in several communities, which now also abide to guidelines on participation, transparency and accountability.

Chile, UNDP has supported the Commissions of Ethics and Transparency in the upper and lower houses of parliament by designing a model that improves integration, functions and procedures. Civil society has been involved in decision-making mechanisms, joining such commission and including proposals to promote integrity and transparency, as was the case of the Constitutional Act of Congress bill. This Chile-UNDP initiative was highlighted as a best practice during the Open Government Partnership Global Summit held in Mexico in October.

Kountâs adaptive AI and machine learning tools protect businesses from chargebacks and false positives. The real-time fraud screening and risk analysis connects to the Identity Trust Global Network and helps businesses better prepare for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulation, which aims to tackle growing rates of fraud and cybercrime.

Barclaycard Payments processes almost 40 per cent of card transactions in the UK. Its new fraud module is hosted within Barclays Transact and uses complex data linked to the Identity Trust Global Network, and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time at the point of check-out, to protect businesses from false positives and chargebacks.

âThanks to Kountâs award-winning fraud detection software, the new module will not only help customers to fight fraud and prevent unwanted chargebacks, it will also help them to maximise sales, improve customer experience and better prepare for the introduction of SCA,â added David Jeffrey, Director of Product at Barclaycard Payments.

The Identity Trust Global Network is the largest network of trust and risk signals. It comprises of 32 billion annual interactions from more than 6,500 customers across 75+ industries. Kountâs AI utilises both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to detect emerging and existing complex fraud.

âThe eCommerce environment is rapidly growing and changing. Barclays Transact and Kountâs Identity Trust Global network operate together to deliver a top of the line customer experience.

U.S. cardholders currently spend an average of 15 hours to resolve new account fraud. Most financial institutions employ a layered fraud prevention strategy using multiple tools to combat identity-related fraud. However, many fraud prevention systems are rules-based, with gaps and limitations that may create customer friction or false positives.

âWith more than 14.7 billion data records breached since 2013, many of which include sensitive data such as name, tax ID number, and address, new account fraud has been a consistently growing challenge for financial institutions,â said Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group.

Visaâs Advanced Identity Score helps financial institutions make more informed identity-related risk decisions by generating a two-digit Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)-compliant identity fraud score in near real-time designed to help prevent fraud loss at the point of credit or loan application.

It uses artificial intelligence and predictive machine learning capabilities with application and identity-related data to generate a risk score for new account applications to help reduce fraud.

âAs consumers, financial institutions and merchants focus on controlling expenses during uncertain times, the cost of new account fraud in terms of money and time lost can be significant. Advanced Identity Score offers financial institutions a powerful tool to use on top of existing systems and processes to prevent identity-related fraud,â said Melissa McSherry, global head of Data, Security and Identity Products and Solutions at Visa.

Visaâs artificial intelligence examines data points in areas including application velocity (the frequency of applications within a period of time), fraud and suspicious activity and bankruptcy data across consumer identity elements. It also incorporates data from government agencies, third-party data providers, law enforcement agencies and self-reported data from consumers.",nam

The financial crimes regulator concluded that Afterpay had âcompleted all remediation necessary to ensure complianceâ.
Afterpayâs share price rose higher on Tuesday, gaining around 3% in early trade, as the company valuation overtakes that of gold miner Newcrest.
Visit Business Insider Australiaâs homepage for more stories.

Afterpayâs share price has broken yet another high as it heads towards the $100 mark, as a major regulatory cloud lifts.

The financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC revealed on Wednesday that it had concluded a 14-month investigation into Afterpay and would take no further action against the buy now, pay later company.

It had assigned an external auditor in June last year to investigate whether it had breached Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF).

âIn response to the findings and recommendations identified in the external audit report, Afterpay has uplifted its AML/CTF compliance framework and financial crime function, and completed all remediation necessary to ensure compliance,â the regulator said in a statement.

AUSTRAC said it had reiterated the importance to Afterpay that it comply with the law and ârole in fighting financial crime to protect the Australian community from harmâ.

Afterpay chair Elana Rubin said the company was âpleasedâ with the result and now better understood its obligations and how to manage risks.

The market was clearly pleased too, as Afterpayâs stock price rose by around 3% to over $97 a share in early trade.

The threat of a negative finding put the fintech darling at risk of major fines and regulatory consequences.

A 2018 AUSTRAC investigation found the Commonwealth Bank had helped drug traffickers move money using the bankâs âsmartâ ATMs. It was a finding that would cost Australiaâs largest bank face, not to mention $700 million.

More recently, Westpac copped a $1.3 billion fine for enabling child abusers to transfer money to South East Asia.

244,"Back in the days when I did a startup I almost de-railed our VC funding after discovering my passport had expired. Without it I couldnât pass the anti-money laundering checks imposed on the fancy and overpriced London law firm weâd hired. Then we almost failed to open a bank account so we could actually receive the money because we were unable to fly over all of our investors from Eastern and Central Europe to pass ID checks in person. The takeaway: compliance is a pain in the ass.

Enter ComplyAdvantage, a London-based startup that claims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help firms manage compliance obligations and at reduced cost. The young company is announcing $8.2 million in Series A funding led by Balderton Capital, money it plans to plough into growth across Europe and the U.S., including opening a New York office this week.

Founded by Charles Delingpole, who previously founded Market Invoice, ComplyAdvantage originally launched to help a small number of businesses meet complex anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements. It has since developed its product to also cover things like Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) lists and other risk and compliance areas that are hard to scale.

âThe way organisations screen and monitor their customer relationships to comply with sanctions regulations and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing risk is fundamentally broken,â ComplyAdvantage VP of Sales & Marketing Stephen Ball tells me over email. âComplyAdvantage is here to help compliance and risk professionals fix itâ.

âLegacy technologies are outdated, expensive and inefficient, typically generating large amounts of manual work in the form of unnecessary risk alerts for the team to review,â he adds, citing as an example a customer having the same name as a completely different Politically Exposed Person. âFurthermore, the criminals are winning, with existing solutions having limited impact on actually reducing financial crimeâ.

That, argues Ball, has left compliance officers jaded. Originally attracted to the role of fighting crime, they find themselves often doing a box-ticking exercise that is ineffective but designed to keep the companies they work for on the right side of the regulators, even if that often fails too. Meanwhile, regulator fines are kind of expected and baked into the pricing models of financial services.

To fix this, ComplyAdvantage is betting that AI and machine learning can help compliance scale properly and says the startup is part of a âregtech revolutionâ that is coming to financial services. âComplyAdvantage are at the forefront unleashing the power of AI and ML to change the way compliance is done,â says the VP of Sales & Marketing.

Adds Tim Bunting, General Partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement: âWe believe that this is one of the few remaining large industries that is still ripe for digital disruption. We are thrilled to be backing Charles and his team, they are well on their way to changing the way companies can understand and monitor risk around their clients. Their mission is truly exciting, and relevant to all businesses.â",nam
245,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday his government would review cooperation over drug policy with the United States and how its agencies operate in Mexico after the recent U.S. arrest of a top military official.

Lopez Obradorâs comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

âWe have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,â Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference.

The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. embassy spokeswoman Adrienne Bory said in a statement to Reuters in the Mexican capital that the United States âvalues its close relationship with Mexico on our shared security challenges.â

âWe look forward to continuing our deep and productive relationship â and many future successes,â the statement said.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEAâs historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard expressed dismay at the U.S. failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos.

âWe have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President (Donald) Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),â Lopez Obrador said.

âBut there are still issues we want to clarify. Weâre only waiting for the elections to pass,â he said of Tuesdayâs U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term.

Lopez Obrador has held up the case of Cienfuegos, who is being held without bail, as an example of rampant corruption in past governments. But he characterized the case as an âisolatedâ event and defended the armyâs role in Mexico.

Cienfuegos was head of the army from 2012 to 2018.",nam
246,"There is no evidence of compromised ballots or corrupt voting systems in the United States presidential elections, officials said, as a top Democrat accused the Republicans who refuse to accept President-elect Joe Bidenâs win of âpoisoningâ democracy.

In a statement on Thursday, senior US federal and state election officials rejected President Donald Trumpâs claims of fraud, saying âthe November 3 election was the most secure in American historyâ.

The statement came hours after Trump once again cried foul, retweeting a baseless claim that an election equipment maker âdeletedâ 2.7 million votes for him nationwide.

âThere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,â said the statement issued by the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council, a public-private umbrella group under the primary federal election security body, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

âWhile we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,â the statement said.

It was signed by the heads of the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State â the officials who manage elections at the state level â and by the chairman of the US Election Assistance Commission.

âPoisoning the well of democracyâ

With most Republican legislators having yet to acknowledge Bidenâs win, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamberâs top Democrat, accused them on Thursday of âdenying realityâ and âauditioning for profiles in cowardice.â

âInstead of working to pull the country back together so that we can fight our common enemy COVID-19, Republicans in Congress are spreading conspiracy theories, denying reality and poisoning the well of our democracy,â he said.

Trumpâs retweet, which in addition to claiming 2.7 million âdeletedâ votes, also said hundreds of thousands of votes had been switched from him to Biden in Pennsylvania and other states.

It was the latest in a series of bogus assertions Trump and the Republicans have put forth in order to reject Bidenâs victory.

Republican legislators such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have stood firm with Trump by supporting his refusal to concede and backing his legal challenges.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday demanded the Republicans stop what she called an âabsurd circusâ and turn to fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

âNow that the people have expressed their views, Joe Biden has won [and] Kamala Harris will be the first woman vice president of the United States,â Pelosi said.

Political experts believe Republicans may be invoking such a strategy as a way to rile up Trumpâs base before two US Senate runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the chamber.

A total of 161 former national security officials, including some who worked with Trump, additionally warned the current administrationâs continued delay in recognising Bidenâs victory is posing âa serious risk to national securityâ.

In a letter, the group, including ex-Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel and Trumpâs former National Security Council senior counterterrorism director Javed Ali, urged General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy to recognise Biden as the apparent president-elect.

A seaport never sleeps. Cargo shipping is vital for keeping supply chains moving and the country fed and well-supplied during the current pandemic. Port employees have continued working throughout the pandemic. Theyâve not shut down like so many industries have.

Another industry that has never shut down is human trafficking. In fact, as much of the world has turned its attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, the crime of human trafficking has been able to flourish.

Although it is quietly hidden, human trafficking thrives during times of chaos and vulnerability. The maritime community can benefit from an improved understanding of human trafficking and learning how employees at seaports can play a key role in helping vulnerable people.

Victims of human trafficking include children, women and men who are subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labor through the use of force, fraud or coercion. At seaports in particular, traffickers can take advantage of discrepancies in maritime law in order to exploit their victims, making a tremendous profit.

It is easier for traffickers to operate at sea. Especially in the COVID-19 era, crewmembers can be forced to work long hours, manipulated into extending their contracts, be paid less than they agreed to work for, or see their wages withheld entirely.

It is not just labor trafficking that seaports need to watch for. Sex trafficking can happen at ports as well. Survivors of human trafficking report that sailors can be sex buyers. In these instances, the sex buying can happen at port facilities or onboard docked ships. The U.S. Department of Justice Human Trafficking Task Force reports that 83 percent of U.S. sex trafficking victims are U.S. citizens, and that the average age a victim is first exploited for commercial sex is between 12-14 years old.

Preventing labor and sex trafficking is becoming more of a priority for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This year, the DOT launched a new national pledge program against human trafficking, where theyâve asked transportation leaders to commit to helping end the practice. Signing the pledge includes committing to train employees to recognize and report the signs of human trafficking.

So far, more than 200 groupsâincluding airports, transportation authorities, and seaports, have joined the DOTâs pledge. And in January 2020, DHS released a new report outlining their commitment to ending human trafficking. This report summarized their priorities for the next five years, including plans for prevention, protection, prosecution and partnershipâwhich includes key security checkpoints.

Seaports are a critical checkpoint for stopping human trafficking. Employees working at ports can be turned into advocates for human trafficking victims when they are properly trained to know how to spot a potential trafficking situation. As more ports increasingly recognize their interdependence with the local community, it will serve ports well to recognize that they have a valuable asset in the fight against human traffickingâtheir workers. When port employees receive human trafficking awareness training, they can learn how to spot a potential trafficking situation happening at maritime facilities and know how to report it quickly and safely. This can allow more exploited people the chance to escape their traffickers and rebuild their lives.

The nonprofit organization Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking (BEST) has created a 30-minute, video-simulated training specifically for port employees. This new training is labeled Ports to Freedom, and it can help front line employees and managers learn the indicators of human trafficking and how they can report it to the proper authorities. When ports begin providing training, it can help save lives by generating more eyes and ears looking out for the warning signs of human trafficking at seaports.

249,"As U.S. politics heat up in advance of the November election, itâs not surprising that extremist groups across the political spectrum are becoming more active and engaged in acts of political violence.

A growing number of scholars and policymakers suggest this problem should be dealt with by designating violent groups as â domestic terrorist â organizations.

Like most students of American extremism, I agree that some members of domestic extremist groups do engage in terrorist acts â using violence to spread fear among targeted groups of people, with the aim of promoting political objectives. Nonetheless, as someone who has studied democraciesâ response to domestic terrorism for almost 20 years, I believe that legally designating domestic extremist groups as terrorist organizations will have limited benefits, if any at all.

What is domestic terrorism

There is not a formal legal definition of a domestic terrorist group, the way there is for international terrorism.

A federal law and a presidential executive order allow the government to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations. Most scholars agree that some American far-right groups are involved in foreign conflicts, and others communicate with foreign groups. But that is not enough to be considered a foreign organization: American extremists do not have permanent logistical, operational and leadership apparatus abroad.

The law, or the executive order, could be revised or replaced in ways that would cover U.S.-based groups.

But the real problem is that designating specific groups as terrorists doesnât actually curb terrorism.

Too little organization

Many acts of far-right violence are perpetrated by individuals, not organized groups. These people may be loosely associated with, or perhaps supporters or online followers of, far-right movements. But they usually operate independently, without help or involvement from others. My research has shown that in many cases, the acts of violence arenât even planned in advance.

In any case, the two major contemporary extremist movements which attracted calls to designate them as terrorist organizations, the âboogalooâ movement on the right and antifa on the left, both lack any hierarchy or central coordination and, therefore, donât fit the criteria of a formal organization.

No real effect on operations

There are several organizations that the U.S. has designated as âterroristsâ over the years â including Hamas, Hezbollah, FARC, Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Islamic State group and its affiliates. Being named to the list subjects a group and its supporters to certain legal, administrative and financial sanctions: Americans who give them money, for instance, can be imprisoned. Non-Americans who are deemed members can be deported from the U.S. or denied permission to enter the country. Banks can be ordered to seize the groupâs funds.

Despite decades on the list, though, many of these groups are still flourishing. Some are even powerful enough to be dominant political movements in their regions or hold territory outside the control of national governments.

Others of these groups appear to have disappeared, but really didnât. Kahane Chai, for instance, was an Israeli organization that advocated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in order to ensure Jewish control of what its members considered part of the Jewish homeland. The U.S. State Department designated it a terrorist group in 1997. Kahane Chai is no longer operating, but many of its members are active in other associations, promoting a similar ideology and engaging in violence.

Similar dynamics are also visible among American extremist movements. In my book on the American far right, I explain that after the Aryan Nations, the most prominent white supremacy group of its time, collapsed in the late 1990s, most of its members dispersed and joined other organizations. The American far-right community was largely unaffected.

Also in the late 1990s, many states passed anti-militia laws, seeking to limit the American militia movement in the wake of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh, who was linked to the Michigan Militia and similar groups in Arizona. The state laws banned people from gathering to practice military-style training, and had a limited effect for about a decade. But in the last 15 years, a second wave of militias has emerged, which actually seems to be more popular, more organized and more capable of mobilizing members than their predecessors.

Most domestic groups remain decentralized, small and without formal structure, even if they coordinate with like-minded people online. The few groups that are more organized tend to split, merge or change their names frequently. In my view, thatâs too fragmented a situation for any formal terrorist designation to have much use. A better solution would be to advance policies that can slow political polarization and counter the development of extremist beliefs in the first place.",nam
250,"UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Thought leaders from across the globe on Monday joined a UN panel tasked with making recommendations to fix the financial system that lacks effective ways to deal with tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering and corruption.

The High-Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda (FACTI Panel) was created jointly by the president of the UN General Assembly and president of the UN Economic and Social Council.

The panel consists of 15 members drawn from policymakers, academia, civil society and the private sector.

""The money that is being hidden in offshore tax havens, laundered through shell companies and outright stolen from public coffers should be put toward ending poverty, educating every child, and building infrastructure that will create jobs and end our dependence on fossil fuels,"" said Ibrahim Mayaki, co-chair of the panel and former prime minister of Niger.

""The systems that governments use to address different types of financial corruption are fraying and do not yet effectively deal with the new ways that are used to game the system,"" he added. ""We aim to help change that.""

A press statement said the panel will explore what further action is needed by governments and financial institutions in areas of financial and beneficial ownership transparency, tax matters, bribery and corruption, confiscation and disposal of the proceeds of crime, money laundering and the recovery and return of stolen assets.

In particular, the statement underscored mobilizing financial resources is critical to achieving the 2030 Agenda of the UN, which consists of 17 sustainable development goals for the world, and stressed that insufficient financial integrity is hindering governments from collecting their fair share of taxes.

""In a world of cross-border trade, investment and finance often via digital platforms, there are limits to what countries can do on their own,"" said Mayaki. ""Illicit finance is a global problem that requires global cooperation in order to achieve effective solutions.""

So far, 12 of the 15 panel members have been confirmed, said the statement, which include former German minister for development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul and professor at University of Pretoria (South Africa) Annet Wanyana Oguttu, besides Mayaki.

The panelists will meet in regional consultations, convene experts and stakeholders from across all sectors and explore new analyses of the issues and solutions.

An interim report will be issued in July 2020 and a final report in February 2021.

251,"The fraud predictor trains itself on batches of transactions that are known to be legitimate or fraudulent, from specific merchant databases, creating a deep understanding of the kind of fraud that is targeting individual merchants.

Within the Dimebox platform, transaction rulesets can then be employed to automatically stop a transaction before it is completed, if the predicted likelihood of fraud is above a defined threshold. The fraud predictor uses self-learning algorithms to calculate a fraud score for every transaction, allowing the user to decide whether or not the score is high enough to warrant blocking, in the context of other criteria. This means the userâs risk appetite can be controlled with extreme precision, creating the right balance between blocking fraud and allowing regular transactions to go through unimpeded.

Because the Dimebox full-stack white-label acquiring platform offers end-to-end processing, fraud data is collected directly by the gateway, via chargebacks and fraud reportsâVisaâs âTC40â report and Mastercardâs âSAFEâ reportâ through direct access to card issuers. By adding the fraud predictor feature to their platform, Dimebox expands their fraud offerings for merchants, PSPs and acquirers by increasing authorization rates and minimizing chargebacks, while eliminating the need for large fraud analysis teams.",nam
252,"ABU DHABI- The Ministry of Justice has called upon law firms to take all necessary measures to ensure anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing obligations are respected.

Law firms were also asked to take the necessary legal measures against offenders under Federal Decree 20 of 2018 in relation to money laundering, its executive regulations, and relevant ministerial decisions as part of the UAE's efforts to address the risks associated with financial crimes.

The Ministry emphasised the importance of law firms' role in combating money laundering, as well as the need for lawyers to assume their role in fighting this crime and identifying risks, handling clients, reporting suspicious transactions, and maintaining proper records.

The Ministry announced that it had recently taken legal action against non-compliant lawyers as part of controls and procedures in this regard, including the decision to suspend 200 law firms from practicing for one month due to non-compliance with established procedures to combat money laundering.

The Ministry noted that penalties included the suspension and cancellation of professional licences, as well as the imposition of administrative fines ranging from 50,000 to 5 million dirhams.

In recent months, the Ministry of Justice has asked all registered lawyers to access the ""Smart Lawyer"" system on the Ministry's website (elawyer.moj.gov.ae), or to contact the Ministryâs money laundering department to update their information in Arabic and English, appoint a compliance officer for each office, and fill out questionnaires relating to procedural compliance. They were also directed through various official media and social media outlets to take all necessary measures to avoid administrative penalties.

The Ministry explained that the suspension of law firms would be lifted once lawyers in charge of the department's legal management office prove that they have carried out procedures to fulfill their obligations under Ministerial Resolution 533 of 2019 on combating money laundering.

The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is of utmost priority for the UAE, with a Ministerial Higher Committee overseeing the National Strategy on Anti-Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism being established under the chairmanship of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.",nam
253,"An anti-corruption watchdog on Tuesday ranked the United States and United Kingdom as the largest exporters most active at enforcing rules meant to prohibit companies from paying bribes in foreign markets, but said many others are doing next to nothing.

Berlin-based Transparency International said only four of 47 countries â the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Israel, making up 16.5% of global exports â were actively enforcing legislation against foreign bribery in 2019.

That's down from seven countries, making up 27% of exports, that were conducting active enforcement in 2018.

âOur research shows that many countries are barely investigating foreign bribery â said Gillian Dell, the lead author of the Transparency report. âUnfortunately, itâs all too common for businesses in wealthy countries to export corruption to poorer countries, undermining institutions and development.â

The 1997 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development convention prohibits bribes to win contracts and licenses, or to dodge taxes and local laws.

China, the world's largest exporter and not a signatory to the convention, was found to conduct âlittle or no enforcement,â in a category that also includes India, and convention members Japan and Korea.

Germany, the world's third-largest exporter and also signatory to the convention, only conducts âmoderate enforcement,â as do other major exporters like France, Italy and Spain.

Germany and Italy both pursued fewer cases in 2019 than in the previous year, while France and Spain improved their performance.

The Netherlands, Canada and Austria â all signatories to the convention â are the biggest exporters in the category of those showing only âlimited enforcement.â

âToo many governments choose to turn a blind eye when their companies use bribery to win business in foreign markets,"" Transparency International head Delia Ferreira Rubio said. âG-20 countries and other major economies have a responsibility to enforce the rules.â

Mexicoâs General Law of Administrative Accountability, set to go into effect next week, is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico and will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement.

On July 19, 2017, Mexicoâs General Law of Administrative Accountability will go into effect. It is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico or considering doing business in Mexico.

When the General Law of Administrative Accountability goes into effect, it will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement. Whereas the 2012 Public Contracting Anti-Corruption Law â the law repealed and replaced by the General Law of Administrative Accountability â was limited to the federal procurement space, the new lawâs prohibitions apply to more conduct and in a wider business context.

First and foremost, the new law broadly defines prohibited âbriberyâ as: (1) where a private party offers or gives money or another gift to a public official to cause the official to do or refrain from doing any act related to the officialâs functions; or (2) where a public official, directly or indirectly, solicits or receives for himself or another person, money or another gift in exchange for doing or refraining from doing any act related to the officialâs functions. In turn, âpublic officialâ is broadly defined as any individual that has employment, a position, or a charge of any type in the Mexican government; government majority-owned companies; public trusts; or that handles federal economic resources.

Other notable prohibitions under the new law include: using or attempting to use influence or economic or political power on a public official in order to obtain a benefit or advantage or to damage any person; using false information during an administrative proceeding in order to obtain an authorization, benefit or advantage, or to damage any person; taking joint action with other private parties to obtain a benefit or advantage in a federal, state or municipal public procurement process; participating in administrative proceedings after being prohibited from doing so due to prior misconduct; misusing public resources (material, human, or financial); and hiring current or former government officials with privileged information for competitive advantage.

The new law applies to public servants and private parties, including both legal entities and individuals. This includes companies in Mexico and those based outside of Mexico, their affiliates and their officers who do business in Mexico and have direct or indirect contacts with Mexican officials. Further, a legal entity may be liable for offenses committed by its employees or third parties acting on behalf of the entity in order to obtain benefits for the entity.

Penalties for violating the new law can be severe. Individuals and companies face sanctions up to twice the amount of any acquired benefits, compensatory and/or punitive damages and/or a temporary ban on participating in procurement, leases, services or state-owned projects (e.g., projects with Pemex). Companies further face the brand new penalties of a temporary suspension of operations or dissolution.

However, Mexicoâs new law also provides that sanctions shall be mitigated by 50-70 percent where a company self-reports past or ongoing misconduct and has implemented and enforced an adequate âIntegrity Policy.â An âIntegrity Policyâ is defined to include, at a minimum: (1) a document setting forth the functions and responsibilities of each of the companyâs areas, the leadership throughout the company and a clear chain of command; (2) a code of conduct with enforcement protocol; (3) control and audit systems that regularly supervise standards of compliance within the organization; (4) internal whistleblower and reporting systems that allow for appropriate reporting to enforcement authorities and disciplinary procedures for employees acting contrary to company policy or Mexican law; and (5) human resources policies for preventing the hiring of persons that may pose compliance risks to the organization.

Companies doing business or seeking to do business in Mexico should take action to inform themselves of the legal implications of the National Anti-Corruption System. This includes developing, implementing, enforcing and documenting an Integrity Policy that applies many of the risk assessment-based procedures and controls that are the hallmarks of a modern and effective compliance program.",nam
255,"In an appeal to the Maltese authorities to do more to find the ringleaders and masterminds responsible as their top political priority, Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and David Kaye suggested that too little had been done to fully investigate her killing.

âTwo years have passed. No convictions, no trials of ringleaders and masterminds,â they said in a joint statement with monitors Dunja MijatoviÄ from regional human rights body, the Council of Europe, and Harlem DÃ©sir from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

âOn the contrary, posthumous libel suits continue to target the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia and makeshift memorials of her are frequently removed. This only adds to the sorrow and pain of her family and loved ones.â

Ms. Caruana Galizia, a well-known investigative reporter who made a name for herself uncovering graft in the Mediterranean island, was killed by a bomb planted under her car seat near her home in Bidnija, on 16 October 2017.

Three men who were charged with her murder were âfinallyâ ordered to stand trial, the rights experts noted, almost 20 months after the killing.

According to media reports of initial court proceedings, the defendants, who were charged with planting and detonating the bomb, pleaded not guilty, and are awaiting trial.

Ahead of Wednesdayâs statement by the rights experts, the Maltese authorities announced that a public inquiry into the killing had been set up.

Highlighting the need for accountability for ânot only those who carried out the murder, but everyone complicit in it, including the masterminds behind itâ, the experts underlined widespread public revulsion at the crime, which âshook people in Europe and beyondâ.

Journalism â as practised by Daphne Caruana Galizia is in the interest of the public and democracy, the experts maintained, while attacks on journalists ânot only deny their right to lifeâ¦they deny the publicâs right to knowâ.

They added: âThe echo of the explosion that killed Daphne Caruana Galizia is still ringing in our memory with the ultimate question: when will justice be served, and bring a little comfort to her loved ones? The Government of Malta owes an answer to Daphne, her family, Maltese society and all journalists around the world.â

257,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of Mexicoâs organized crime unit stepped down on Thursday, just weeks after announcing that members of his team had been charged with having links to the nationâs most powerful drug cartel.

Jose Cuitlahuac Salinas, head of the unit in the attorney generalâs office, resigned for âpersonal reasons,â a spokesman for the office said.

Attorney General Marisela Morales has accepted his resignation, which was effective immediately, he added.

Salinas will be replaced by Rodrigo Archundia Barrientos, an expert on kidnappings at the organized crime unit, Morales said in a statement.

On October 17 Salinas said the Mexican government had charged seven officials, including three members of his unit, with passing information on government raids and investigations to the Sinaloa cartel of Joaquin âShortyâ Guzman, Mexicoâs most-wanted man.

Salinas himself was not being investigated, the spokesman at the attorney generalâs office said.

Mexicoâs powerful drug cartels are suspected of spending millions of dollars a year to corrupt officials, but charges are not common and convictions are few and far between.

President Felipe Calderon, who leaves office at the end of the month, staked his reputation on bringing the drug gangs to heel. But his offensive against organized crime coincided with a sharp increase in drug-related violence in Mexico.

More than 60,000 people have been killed in clashes between the gangs and their battles with security forces since Calderon took office six years ago.

The Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion Foundation (Piaccf) is also meant to help those who have been intimidated, threatened or maliciously punished while on duty.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the foundation would be responsible for the International Anti-Corruption Champion Fund and to complement the aspirations of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (Uncac).

""We know that combating and exposing corruption is very dangerous, and the world has witnessed many who attempted to do so pay dearly, even with their lives.

""Obviously, those who involve themselves in corruption are powerful and rich, and their objectives are for more power and wealth and to have the means and resources to punish and stop those who attempt to put an end to their shenanigans.

""We are here to tell the world that all the anti-corruption officers who have paid heavy prices in the course of their duty are our champions and our heroes,"" he said when launching the foundation on Tuesday night (Feb 11).

The Prime Minister paid tribute to the contributions of several individuals in the fight against corruption.

They include former attorney-general Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, former Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief commissioner Datuk Seri Shukri Abdull in relation to the 1MDB scandal.

""It is a significant case, as it became the turning point of Malaysiaâs political direction and sparked an awakening among Malaysians.

""Their collective courage and determination brought a kleptocratic regime down, in an unprecedented show of people's power.

""I would also like to express my utmost respect to all the men and women across the globe who had given their time, lives and commitment in putting an end to the corruption scourge,"" said Dr Mahathir.

The event also saw two anti-graft officers being honoured after having paid a heavy price in their efforts to combat corruption.

The recipients of the Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion 2020 Award are Datuk Anthony Kevin Morais, a senior deputy public prosecutor who was murdered in 2015 while investigating a corruption scandal, and Novel Baswedan, an officer with Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission, who during one of his investigations in June 2016, had acid thrown at him.

It left him partially blind.

259,"An investigation into this summerâs Twitter hack by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) has ended with a stinging rebuke for how easily Twitter let itself be duped by a âsimpleâ social engineering technique â and with a wider call for key social media platforms to be regulated on security.

In the report, the NYSDFS points, by way of contrasting example, to how quickly regulated cryptocurrency companies acted to prevent the Twitter hackers scamming even more people â arguing this demonstrates that tech innovation and regulation arenât mutually exclusive.

Its point is that the biggest social media platforms have huge societal power (with all the associated consumer risk) but no regulated responsibilities to protect users.

The report concludes this is a problem U.S. lawmakers need to get on and tackle stat â recommending that an oversight council be established (to âdesignate systemically important social media companiesâ) and an âappropriateâ regulator appointed to âmonitor and superviseâ the security practices of mainstream social media platforms.

âSocial media companies have evolved into an indispensable means of communications: more than half of Americans use social media to get news, and connect with colleagues, family, and friends. This evolution calls for a regulatory regime that reflects social media as critical infrastructure,â the NYSDFS writes, before going on to point out there is still âno dedicated state or federal regulator empowered to ensure adequate cybersecurity practices to prevent fraud, disinformation, and other systemic threats to social media giantsâ.

âThe Twitter Hack demonstrates, more than anything, the risk to society when systemically important institutions are left to regulate themselves,â it adds. âProtecting systemically important social media against misuse is crucial for all of us â consumers, voters, government, and industry. The time for government action is now.â

Weâve reached out to Twitter for comment on the report

Among the key findings from the Departmentâs investigation are that the hackers broke into Twitterâs systems by calling employees and claiming to be from Twitterâs IT department â through which simple social engineering method they were able to trick four employees into handing over their log-in credentials. From there they were able to access the Twitter accounts of high profile politicians, celebrities, and entrepreneurs, including Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian West, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and a number of cryptocurrency companies â using the hijacked accounts to tweet out a crypto scam to millions of users.

Twitter has previously confirmed that a âphone spear phishingâ attack was used to gain credentials.

Per the report, the hackersâ âdouble your bitcoinâ scam messages, which contained links to make a payment in bitcoins, enabled them to steal more than $118,000 worth of bitcoins from Twitter users.

Although a considerably larger sum was prevented from being stolen as a result of swift action taken by regulated crypto companies â namely: Coinbase, Square, Gemini Trust Company and Bitstamp â who the Department said blocked scores of attempted transfers by the fraudsters.

âThis swift action blocked over 6,000 attempted transfers worth approximately $1.5 million to the Hackersâ bitcoin addresses,â the report notes.

Twitter is also called out for not having a cybersecurity chief in post at the time of the hack â after failing to replace Mike Convertino, who left in December 2019 to join cyber resilience firm Arceo.

Last month it announced Rinki Sethi had been hired as CISO.

âDespite being a global social media platform boasting over 330 million average monthly users in 2019, Twitter lacked adequate cybersecurity protection,â the NYSDFS writes. âAt the time of the attack, Twitter did not have a chief information security officer, adequate access controls and identity management, and adequate security monitoring â some of the core measures required by the Departmentâs first-in-the-nation cybersecurity regulation.â

European Union data protection law already bakes in security requirements as part of a comprehensive privacy and security framework (with major penalties possible for security breaches). However an investigation by the Irish DPC of a 2018 Twitter security incident is still yet to conclude after a draft decision failed to gain the backing of the other EU data watchdogs this August â triggering a further delay to the pan-EU regulatory process.",nam

This is lower than the rates for Nigeria (44%) and Liberia (53%), but much higher than Senegal (15%).

And according to the countryâs Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, Ghana loses $US3bn every year to corruption. Beyond economic costs, corruption erodes confidence in democratic institutions, undermines the rule of law and violates human rights.

It was in this context that our study sought to understand how young educated adults â described in our study as prospective elites â reacted to corrupt opportunities.

What constitutes corruption?

Corruption is a complex social problem. It takes different forms in different societies, and it changes over time. A widely-cited definition comes from Transparency International: corruption is âthe abuse of entrusted power for private gainâ. This is helpful, but I prefer the definition by the criminologist John Kleinig, who wrote that officials:

act corruptly when, in exercising or failing to exercise their authority, they act with the primary intention of furthering private or departmental/divisional advantage.

This definition makes the point that corruption includes both what people do and what they fail to do. The critical issue is a personâs motive. It also makes clear that corrupt officials need not benefit from the transaction: sometimes officials abuse their authority for the benefit of groups to which they belong. Examples would include a religious group, an ethnic group or a political party.

The definition also takes us beyond monetary gains to include other gains such as esteem, especially in cases of nepotism and cronyism.

More recently, I have become interested in what some describe as âdelayed corruptionâ. Here officials exercise their authority with an eye on personal advantage that will accrue to them once they leave public office.

The why

We first sought to determine the type of corruption that the young adults were likely to engage in. We presented 530 with scenarios depicting various forms of corrupt opportunities, and asked what they would do in such cases.

In explaining why people resorted to corruption, we considered bribery and nepotism across three situations: policing; public procurement; and the abuse of power for the benefit of others rather than the young adults themselves. A number of important findings emerged.

We found that people were more inclined to engage in influence peddling â with and on behalf of friends and relatives â rather than to pay bribes directly. For example, nearly 50% indicated they would ask friends to use their positions to award them a government contract while only a third said they would pay a bribe for a similar contract.

This suggests that friendship and kinship networks, rather than direct monetary exchange, are important channels through which corrupt exchanges take place.

We also found that perceptions of being found out â in other words, risk factors â played a big role. This is consistent with research findings from elsewhere showing that corruption is more likely to happen in environments where there is weak monitoring and the risk of detection is low.

We also found that young adults who defined a successful life in terms of material possessions were consistently more inclined to engage in bribery and nepotism. They were willing to pay bribes or use friendship networks to secure public contracts, to influence police officers, and to make decisions that favoured others.

Finally, we found that a personâs attachments to the state and to kinship groups mattered a great deal for their decision to resort to corruption. A strong attachment to the state made corrupt conduct less likely; a strong attachment to kinship groups made it more likely.

What needs to be done

Anti-corruption efforts need to focus on improving the detection of corrupt transactions â whether these are bribery or nepotism and cronyism â because it is certainty of detection that deters criminal conduct. Research evidence also shows perceptions of certainty increase peopleâs willingness to report corruption to the authorities.

Three things can be considered.

First, the anti-corruption architecture could be redesigned to grant the police a pivotal role. The police have the capacity to build an extensive intelligence network across the country. They are present in every city and their intelligence networks can help detect efforts to hide wealth obtained through corruption. They also provide easy access for citizens to report corruption. But an anti-corruption role for the police requires improved training, better resources, and insulating them from partisan politics.

Second, invert the logic underpinning efforts to detect procurement corruption. Currently, it is presumed that procurement transactions are âcleanâ until evidence of corruption emerges. That needs to change to adopt the logic that underpins airport security screening: assume that every public procurement is corrupt until proven otherwise, and it should not proceed until it has gone through a transparent process of scrutiny. Proceedings of procurement boards, including reasons for decisions, should be video recorded and made public.

Third, periodic integrity testing of officials can heighten the risk of detection. This can be âtargetedâ at specific officials for whom complaints about corruption do not appear sufficient for criminal prosecution. An example is what the undercover journalism Anas Aremeyaw Anas has done so effectively. But integrity testing can also be ârandomâ and aimed at potential offenders.

Anti-corruption interventions also need to be part of broader reforms to build the stateâs legitimacy. Weak bonds with the state create a predatory relationship in which some citizens seek to exploit it for their individual and group interests.",nam
261,"""Everything starts with trust."" That's how Deutsche Bank wooed clients in the mid-1990s. This slogan, however, has long since been history, as the bank completely gambled away the confidence of its customers in the years that followed.

The moneylender wanted to play in the financial premier league, so principles were thrown overboard, presumably because it was the only way to increase the bottom line. Returns were everything because the Deutsche bankers' profit machine had to be lubricated, by all means necessary.

From interest rate manipulation and money laundering to poorly secured mortgages and business relationships with questionable customers â such as the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein â Deutsche Bank always had its fingers in the pie. The dirtier the deal, the better. And as the FinCEN files show, Deutsche Bank, once again, tops the charts â well over half of the suspicious transaction reports leaked to the investigative journalists' group implicate Germany's flagship lender.

Murky dealings with Moscow

When the bank's money-laundering activities in Russia were exposed in 2015, the US financial regulator wrote of ""greed and corruption"" in its final report. This villainy fueled the culture at Deutsche Bank. After a $600 million (â¬506 million) fine was imposed, the bank's bosses promised a big cleanup. The Frankfurt-based lender invested around $1 billion to strengthen internal controls, including the recruitment of 1,500 specialists. It now transpires that its opaque deals with Russian clients may have continued after these reforms. In 2017, the bank was requested by US authorities to disclose details about its transactions with Moscow after suspicions were raised.

As expected, Deutsche Bank has rejected all allegations. It says the transactions leaked in the FinCEN files would have been fully disclosed to authorities anyway, and that they all took place before its 2016 reforms.

The lender insists it is altogether ""another bank"" and that the allegations against CEO Christian Sewing are also unfounded. Sewing, who has headed the company since mid-2018, was head of Internal Audit five years earlier. His department audited the Russian transactions and found nothing. Now the firm insists that Sewing never saw or signed off on the audits, which is, of course, a flimsy defense to keep him out of the line of fire.

No culture change

It is increasingly clear that the ""cultural change"" that was so loudly proclaimed at Deutsche Bank is not in full swing and that not all of the approximately 88,000 employees have fully understood what it means. The insistence that Deutsche Bank is a reformed institution is starting to fall on deaf ears, especially with the latest revelations.

Maybe they should dig out that the old ""Everything starts with trust"" slogan once again because that's what's still missing today. For Deutsche Bank, the FinCEN files are an oath of disclosure.

263,"The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, is calling for the government to introduce a long-promised register of foreign owners of UK properties, to prevent criminals using homes as âdodgy bank accountsâ.

Reports of suspected money laundering have more than doubled since David Cameron used a speech in Singapore in 2015 to pledge that there would be âno place for dirty money in Britainâ.

The then prime minister promised a register of overseas companies owning UK properties, to make the market more transparent and prevent money from corruption being parked in lavish houses in central London.

But the proposal is still awaiting implementation. A draft registration of overseas entities bill was published in 2018, but has not yet been introduced to parliament.

Dodds will use a speech to the Labour Housing Group on Saturday to highlight the partyâs determination over the issue, and insist efforts to target money laundering should not be set aside because of the pandemic.

âWe are at a fork in the road,â she is to say. âThe Conservatives could choose to focus their energies so that people in this country have affordable, decent homes to live in. They could finally set up a register of overseas entities to flush out the criminals using our homes as dodgy bank accounts. In doing so, they could secure a quicker, fairer and more sustainable economic recovery from the crisis.

âOr they could choose to leave things as they are. Too few houses available to be homes- with prices driven up by those who use property to hide illicit wealth. I urge the Conservatives to finally make the right call.â

The group campaigns for more affordable housing.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a 2% stamp duty surcharge on foreign property owners that will come into effect in April â but it is unclear when the register of foreign owners will be implemented.

Official figures show that reports of suspected money-laundering activities to the National Crime Agency have more than doubled since Cameron made his Singapore speech.

The NCA received 14,465 suspicious activity reports (SARs) relating to possible money laundering in 2015. In the year to March 2019 that had more than doubled to 34,151.

The ease with which foreign investors can launder money through the UK property market was highlighted in the report from parliamentâs intelligence and security committeeâs report on Russia this year that warned of a âLondon laundromatâ.

âSuccessive governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London âlaundromatâ, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures,â the report claimed. âThis has led to a growth industry of âenablersâ including lawyers, accountants, and estate agents who are â wittingly or unwittingly â de facto agents of the Russian state.â

At the time of the December 2019 Queenâs speech, which set out Boris Johnsonâs legislative programme, the government promised to âcontinue to progress legislation to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the UK property marketâ.

The campaign group Transparency International said at the time that the legislation would âstrengthen our defences against illicit financial flows, as the UK seeks to attract overseas investmentâ, and called for it to be âtabled at the earliest possible opportunityâ.

Transparency International research identified 421 UK properties collectively worth more than Â£5bn that were bought with suspicious wealth. The group then checked the land titles for these properties to identify 56 law firms involved in facilitating 132 of these transactions. In most cases they were the registered address of secretive companies used to hold the property.",nam
264,"(Washington, DC) â The way Peru âs Congress removed President MartÃ­n Vizcarra from office on November 9, 2020, and the immediate consequences for the independence of the constitutional court, pose a serious threat to the rule of law in the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The Organization of American States (OAS) should urgently convene a meeting of its Permanent Council and closely monitor the situation.
The Peruvian Congress ousted President Vizcarra under questionable legal authority, claiming that he lacked âmoral capacityâ because of corruption allegations against him that prosecutors are investigating. Dozens of lawmakers in Congress, themselves under investigation for various offenses, had attempted but failed to oust him on other grounds in September. Vizcarra had pushed forward various anti-corruption initiatives that affected members of Congress. Manuel Merino, the head of Congress, was sworn in as president on November 10 amid massive protests and reports that the police used excessive force in response.
âThe allegations against Vizcarra should be investigated, but the legality of his ousting is highly dubious and seems driven by legislatorsâ own interests in evading accountability,â said JosÃ© Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. âLeaders in the Americas should closely monitor decisions by Merino and Congress. There is every reason to suspect that they will use Vizcarraâs ousting to further undermine the rule of law.â
In the next few months, the Peruvian Congress and president are set to carry out key processes for the countryâs institutions, including selecting justices for the constitutional court and organizing the 2021 presidential election, scheduled for April. A challenge to the legality of removing a president under Peruâs constitutional âmoral capacityâ clause is currently pending before the Constitutional Tribunal.
During his presidency, which began in March 2018, Vizcarra pursued several anti-corruption efforts, including to limit parliamentary immunity and to reform financing rules for political parties.
Media reports indicate that dozens of members of Congress, including from Merinoâs party, are under criminal investigation, including on corruption charges.
Congress is currently in the process of appointing justices to the countryâs Constitutional Tribunal, even as the court considers the constitutionality of the presidentâs ouster. On November 3, a group of lawyers said that Congress had arbitrarily excluded them as candidates. Congress should ensure a fair selection process that guarantees the independence and impartiality of the Constitutional Tribunal, Human Rights Watch said.
Peruâs Congress did not impeach Vizcarra. It can impeach a president under the Peruvian Constitution, but only if the president engaged in treason, prevented elections, unlawfully dissolved Congress, or prevented the work of Congress or of the countryâs electoral bodies. Instead, Congress cited an obscure constitutional provision that allows it to declare the presidency has been âvacatedâ if the president resigns or faces âphysical or moral incapacity.â
Constitutional experts have stated that a criminal investigation would not trigger this provision, which is not meant to punish misconduct but to address situations in which the president is unable to perform the functions of the office. Yet Congress accused Vizcarra of âmoral incapacityâ on November 2 based on allegations that he had engaged in corruption in 2014 when he was a regional governor. The November 9 debate in Congress over whether to remove Vizcarra lasted six hours, during which Vizcarra was given only one hour to speak.
The Vizcarra administration had scheduled the presidential election for April 2021. Vizcarra was not running for re-election. In his inauguration speech on November 10, Merino said he âratifiedâ the countryâs electoral calendar. The government should ensure free and fair elections, and avoid arbitrary delays, Human Rights Watch said.
On November 10, thousands took to the streets of Lima, Peruâs capital, to protest Vizcarraâs removal, with many rejecting its legitimacy.
Journalists and human rights groups reported that police officers arbitrarily dispersed peaceful protesters, used excessive force, including tear gas and âless-lethal weapons,â against peaceful protesters, and arbitrarily detained some. While demonstrations were largely peaceful, some protesters became violent, including by throwing stones at the police.
International human rights law protects the right to peaceful assembly. Authorities should protect peaceful demonstrators and avoid unnecessary or disproportionate restrictions on such assemblies. Even when there are isolated incidents of violence, authorities should use the least intrusive means necessary to address them, while protecting the rights of others to peacefully assemble.
Under international standards, law enforcement should avoid the use of force, including tear gas, to disperse peaceful protests, even when it deems such protests unlawful. International guidelines such as the UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms stipulate that in the event of violence, force â including tear gas â should only be used to the extent that it is necessary and proportionate to address such violence.
Law enforcement agents are expected to avoid exacerbating the situation and are only allowed to escalate their use of force if other measures have proven ineffective or have no likelihood of quelling the violence. Any use of force should be preceded by clear warnings.
âPeruvians have every right to demonstrate over their countryâs crisis,â Vivanco said. âThe police and other authorities need to protect peaceful protests, and in all situations refrain from using excessive force.â",nam

Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.

The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.

Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue - billions of euros for the largest online firms.

But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.

The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.

Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.

""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""

That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".

But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.

""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.

""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""

Incitement to hatred

France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.

But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.

France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.

Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.

That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment.

Failure to remove content could attract a fine of up to â¬1.25m (Â£1.1m).

France's regulator, the Superior Council of the Audiovisual (CSA), will have the power to impose heftier fines of up to 4% of global turnover for continuous and repeated violations.

Laetitia Avia, the MP from President Macron's LREM party who proposed the bill, said the law would protect victims, while reaffirming the country's commitment to freedom of expression.

However, France's Republicans party voted against the measure.

Member Constance Le Grip told the National Assembly that fighting online hatred could not come at the expense of freedom of expression.

Her colleague in the Senate Bruno Retailleau tweeted that the new law was ""incompatible with respect for public freedoms"".

Facebook said it was working closely with French regulator CSA and others ""on the implementation of this law"".

Twitter's head of public affairs in France, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, told Reuters that the company would continue to work with the government to fight illegal content and hate speech.",nam
266,"CNA).- Two decades after the enactment of a landmark anti-trafficking law, the threat has evolved during the current pandemicâand so too, must the response, says the congressman who wrote the law.

âWeâve got to make sure that thereâs a continued prioritization of all the law enforcementâfrom the cop on the beat, to the prosecutors, to the U.S. attorneysâto make this a priority,â said Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), author of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, in an interview with CNA.

Smith is also the special representative on human trafficking issues to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, an international body of legislators from 57 member states that promotes security through dialogue.

During the new coronavirus pandemic, he warned, children are more vulnerable than before to being trafficked, and survivors are at greater risk of being re-trafficked.

âIn talking to the NGOs, the Catholic Church, others, they know that there has been a very serious increaseâand law enforcement backs this up as wellâin grooming of children online,â Smith said.

With children at home more often during lockdowns or partial lockdowns, predators try to contact them online. âThat becomes a process of exploitation that ends with rape and other kinds of heinous activity,â Smith said.

âThese people who do it know how to manipulate the mind of a child.â

Also as a result of the pandemic, trafficking survivors may have less access to the help they need if the operations of NGOs and charities are restricted because of public health orders, or a lack of donations. Shelters or employment programs might not be available. Jobs that once helped victims get back on their feet may not exist in the current economic climate.

âTheyâre very susceptible for being re-trafficked,â Smith said of survivors.

Smith authored the TVPA, which was signed into law 20 years ago on Oct. 28. Although the Mann Act had prohibited prostitution and unlawful sexual behavior across state or country borders, there were âno prosecutions whatsoeverâ for human trafficking at the time before the TVPA, Smith said.

The public was also not fully aware of the scope of the problem. Smith recalled talking to U.S. attorneys about trafficking, but they would think he was referring to drug trafficking.

Some people thought the issue of sex trafficking to be just a âvice,â without considering the abuses inflicted upon women and children. There was a âvery antagonistic view toward prostitutes and prostitution,â Smith said, ânot realizing, I believe, that so many of those women are coerced into that profession.â

His law not only beefed up prosecution of traffickersâestablishing punitive sentences up to life imprisonment, and asset confiscationâbut effected a âsea changeâ in how trafficking victims were treated under the law, he said.

Under the TVPA, minors with at least one commercial sex act were considered sex trafficking victims and could not be prosecuted. If âforce, fraud, or coercionâ against an adult were established in a trafficking case, those adult victims could not be prosecuted either.

Furthermore, the law had a comprehensive approach to fighting trafficking. It both punished perpetrators, and set up what Smith calls a âwhole-of-governmentâ strategy including funding protection for victims, and prevention programs.

It reauthorized the Violence Against Woman Act, for instance, and doubled funding under the law for womenâs shelters, rehab programs, and housing and other initiatives for battered and abused women. It set up a national hotline for victims to report and get connected to help, and created a whole new asylum category, the âT Visa,â for trafficking survivors to come to the U.S. temporarily.

With trafficking occurring across international borders, the TVPA established an office at the State Department for monitoring other countriesâ records on fighting trafficking, and holding them accountable.

In the 20 years since the lawâs enactment, there have been thousands of trafficking prosecutionsâincluding some recent notable ones.

Charges made in 2019 against investment banker Jeffrey Epstein were under Smithâs TVPA. âSmallvilleâ actress Allison Mack and NXIVMâs Keith Raniere were charged under the TVPA for running a sex trafficking ring.

âWe could always do better, no doubt about it,â Smith said of increasing prosecutions, âbut the key is a serious and sustained effort to, wherever there is a pimp thatâs cruelly mistreating a woman, we go after him. And we stop him. And we put him behind bars for a very, very long periods of time.â

On Oct. 27, Raniere was sentenced to 120 years in prison for sex trafficking and racketeering.

The next day, deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen looked back on the enactment of the TVPA on its 20 th anniversary.

âIt is important to look back at the coordinated efforts that produced the TVPA,â he said, âa collaboration of survivors, civil society advocates from faith-based groups and across the political spectrum, and policymakers.â

That collaboration, Smith told CNA, was critical in the fight against trafficking the past two decades. Federal agencies have come together with leaders of faith communities and NGOs, and local and state prosecutors and law enforcement âto all get on the same page for combatting this.â

âThat approach, I think, still is a good one,â he said.",nam
267,"Why is the Commission proposing a Directive on the criminalisation of money laundering?

Terrorist organisations and organised crime need financing  to maintain their criminal networks, to recruit and supply, and to commit terrorist acts themselves. Money laundering allows criminal organisations to benefit from their illegal activities and maintain their operations. In essence, money laundering uses the earnings generated through a multitude of illegal cross-border activities  such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illicit arms trafficking and corruption  to acquire, convert or transfer property, while hiding the true nature of its origin, in order to use the revenues of these crimes in the legitimate economy. A strengthened criminal response to money laundering contributes to cutting off sources of finance and countering the financial incentives which drive crime, making a powerful contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime.

The current criminal law framework against money laundering in the EU is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently coherent to be fully effective. All Member States criminalise money laundering; however, existing differences in the definition, scope and sanctions of money laundering offences affect cross-border police and judicial cooperation between national authorities as well as the exchange of information. These differences in legal frameworks can also be exploited by criminals and terrorists, who could carry out financial transactions where they perceive anti-money laundering measures to be weakest.

In February 2016, the Commission set out an Action Plan to ensure that Member States have the necessary tools at their disposal to address new threats linked to terrorist financing. The Action Plan recognised that while Member States have criminalised money laundering, there are differences across the EU as to the definition of money laundering and the sanctions applied. To that end the Commission committed to propose a Directive harmonising money laundering offenses and sanctions by the end of 2016.

The measures proposed today will provide for a strengthened legal framework to combat money laundering in the European Union, improve enforcement in this area and reduce the threat from terrorist and organised crime organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities. They will further reinforce the EU's capacity to tackle organised crime and terrorist financing more effectively and more generally enhance the internal security of the EU and the safety of EU citizens.

What are the key objectives of the Directive?

Today's proposal for a Directive aims at tackling money laundering by means of criminal law. It proposes to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering, as well as common provisions to improve the investigation of those offences and to ensure better cooperation in the fight against money laundering.

The Directive aims at implementing international obligations on money laundering and terrorist financing such as the Warsaw Convention and relevant recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

In addition, the proposal will improve cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between competent authorities. All Member States have criminalised money laundering, but there are differences between Member States both on the definition of money laundering and on the sanctions applied to such a crime. These differences create obstacles that hinder cross-border judicial and police cooperation to effectively tackle money laundering. The Directive aims to remove these obstacles by setting up a common definition of money laundering across the EU.

Finally, the measures will help to prevent criminals from exploiting the differences between national legislations to their advantage. A situation where there are widely differing sanctions for money laundering across the EU creates a risk of ""forum shopping"" by offenders, or in other words  criminals choosing to carry out their crimes where they are less likely to face serious sanctions.

What is the scale of the money laundering problem?

The United Nations estimated the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 at approximately USD 2.1 trillion, which is equivalent to 3.6% of global GDP. The amount of money generated from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the EU has been estimated at 110 billion per year, corresponding to 1% of the EU GDP. For criminals to benefit fully from the proceeds of their crimes, these criminal proceeds need to be laundered.

Criminal investigations on money laundering involving several EU Member States are very frequent. As part of the Commissions consultation process, estimates in one Member State suggest that between 10 to 15% of cases have a cross border dimension. In two Member States the same estimate is 20%, and in a couple of Member States it reaches 70%. Five Member States estimate that the proportion of money laundering investigations with a cross-border element ranges between 38% and 50%.

Eurojust registered 724 cases on money laundering between 2012 and July 2015, rising from 193 cases in 2013 to 286 money laundering cases in 2015. Furthermore, a large number of Member States have estimated the number of Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) with a cross-border dimension to be between 30% and 50%. The number of requests for information and cooperation transmitted through FIU.Net, the information exchange tool of EU Financial Intelligence Units, increased from 12,076 in 2014 to 17,149 in 2015.

What are the links between money laundering and terrorist financing?

Large terrorist groups as well as smaller cells and individuals often finance their attacks and activities through crime. Organised crime can support terrorism, for example through the supply of illegal weapons. Terrorists can use money laundering schemes to convert, conceal or acquire the proceeds of criminal activities.

A strengthened EU legal framework to criminalise money laundering would both help to combat organised crime and contribute to tackling terrorist financing more effectively and reduce the threat from terrorist organisations by hindering their capacity to finance their activities.

This Directive will also complement the Directive on combating terrorism, which sets a comprehensive definition of the crime of terrorist financing, covering not only terrorist offences but also terrorist-related offences such as recruitment, training and propaganda.

How does this proposal fit in the overall EU framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing?

This proposal is an integral part of the EU response to money laundering and complements measures in place aimed at detecting, disrupting and preventing the abuse of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, notably the revised 4 th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Transfer of Funds Regulation. While these measures help to prevent money laundering and facilitate investigations into money laundering offences, they do not address the absence of a uniform definition of money laundering.

The proposal also reinforces the criminal law framework with regard to offences relating to terrorist groups and the criminalisation of terrorism financing, as included in the proposal for a Directive on combating terrorism.

Will the Directive ensure that the EU is compliant with international standards?

This proposal aims to implement international requirements on the criminalisation of money laundering. The Directive will move the EU closer to meeting its international obligations in this area, such as those set out in the Council of Europe Warsaw Convention, as well as Financial Action Task Force recommendations.

Recommendation 3 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) calls on countries to criminalise money laundering on the basis of the UN Vienna Convention of 1988 and the UN Palermo Convention of 2001. It asks countries to criminalise the laundering of proceeds of all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences (see below for explanation), as well as ancillary activities unless this is not permitted by fundamental principles of domestic law.

The Warsaw Convention is the most comprehensive international convention on money laundering. It requests parties to adopt legislative measures to facilitate the prevention, investigation and prosecution of money laundering as well as the effective freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of crime.

The Warsaw Convention was signed by 26 EU Member States, of which 17 have so far ratified it. The EU signed the Warsaw Convention in 2009 but has not yet ratified it. This proposal for a Directive would be an important step towards ratification of the Warsaw Convention.

What is ""self-laundering"" and why has the Commission included it in the proposal?

Self-laundering refers to the situation where a person who has committed a crime tries to hide the illicit origins of the proceeds from that crime. Self-laundering is an additional crime, different to the predicate offence, which violates the integrity of the financial market and thus it's important to prosecute those who try and benefit from its proceeds.

As self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions, this can cause difficulties for some Member States in establishing a prosecutable offence and investigating and tracing the flow of illegally acquired funds. Eurojust indicates that the fact that self-laundering is not criminalised in all jurisdictions may cause difficulties for some Member States to establish a prosecutable offence and to investigate and trace the flow of black money.

What is a ""predicate offence""?

In money laundering cases, a predicate offence is the underlying criminal activity which generated the property laundered. An example of a predicate offence can be drug trafficking which leads to profits which may then be laundered.

The definition of predicate offences can vary from country to country.

Why is it necessary to establish a list of predicate offences?

International conventions and FATF recommendations require the inclusion of a number of offences as predicate offences for money laundering such as terrorism, including terrorist financing, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, illicit arms trafficking, environmental crime, fraud, corruption or tax crimes. However, these categories are simply listed and not defined, leaving wide scope for national differences in the range of predicate offences.

By establishing a list of predicate offences, this Directive will therefore make cross-border cooperation more effective, as well as fulfilling international requirements. All the predicate offences listed (except for cybercrime) come from the relevant international conventions which the Directive aims to implement. The references to EU law have been added only for those predicate offences where there is already an existing act at EU level requiring the criminalisation of a certain conduct.

Why did the Commission include cybercrime as predicate offence?

In the context of an increasing threat of cybercrime and attacks against information systems, the Directive also includes ""cybercrime"" in a list of offences related to terrorist financing. Computer crime is the only area of crime mentioned in Article 83 TFEU which is not listed in the categories of offences designated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Warsaw Convention. The financial impact of cybercrime and the size of related proceeds are hard to quantify, but cases show that proceeds from cybercrime are laundered through sophisticated schemes, involving both traditional and new payment methods. In order to disrupt the financial incentive that drives many cybercrime activities, the proposal qualifies cybercrime as a predicate offence for money laundering.

Does this proposal go beyond international requirements?

In certain areas, this proposal goes beyond international requirements. It establishes the minimum level of the maximum sanctions and it also criminalises ""self-laundering"" (see above for explanation).

In addition to listing general categories of crime, the list provided in this proposal includes cybercrime and crimes where there is legislation at EU level defining the predicate offences, by making a reference to the relevant EU legislative acts.

What are the next steps of the proposal?

The proposal for a Directive on countering money laundering by criminal law will now be transmitted to the European Parliament and Council for adoption, in line with the normal legislative process. Once adopted, Member States have two years to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national law.

To which Member States does the proposal apply?

The proposal applies to all EU Member States except for Denmark, which is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive. The United Kingdom and Ireland can decide to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive.

269,"On a mission to teach designers to be a force for good in the world

ArtCenter College of Design Provost Karen Hofmann announced today that, after a comprehensive search, the College has named Chris Hacker to the position of chair of the Product Design department. A professor in ArtCenters Graduate Graphic Design department since 2016, Hacker officially took over the role on January 22, 2019.

Chris brings vast depth and breadth of design and leadership experience to the Product Design department and to the College at large, said Hofmann, who led the department since 2009 prior to becoming provost. I am thrilled to hand the reins of this incredible program and community of students, faculty, alumni and partners to him.

A leader in the field, Hacker defines design as valued by business, driven by technological change and a force for good. These principles, explains Hofmann, are synchronous with the mission of the Product Design department for its students to visualize and realize the future with thoughtfulness and intent. I am confident his leadership and vision will guide the program into the next era of success and impact, she continued.

I am honored and humbled to be asked to lead this iconic product design program, said Hacker. I look forward with excitement to adding the passion and enthusiasm I have for design and sustainability to support the education of young product design minds at ArtCenter. It is my mission to teach designers that they must be a force for good in the world.

As a member of the Graduate Graphic Design department faculty, Hacker helped develop the curriculum with a focus on strategy, design management and professional preparation. While at ArtCenter, he has co-taught Trans-Disciplinary Studio sponsored projects, and worked closely with graduating Product Design students to prepare for the recruitment process and professional life.

Prior to teaching at the College, Hacker spent the majority of his career leading design teams at Herman Miller, Johnson & Johnson, Aveda Corporation, Warner Bros. Studio Store, Steuben Glass Works, Dansk International Designs and Estée Lauder. Throughout the years, he has hired numerous ArtCenter graduates to work at those companies.

While chief design officer at Johnson & Johnson, he sponsored several Trans-Disciplinary Studio courses including early Testlab Berlin programs and DesignStorms at ArtCenter. Trans-Disciplinary Studios are 14-week classes sponsored by industry partners. DesignStorms are immersive three-day projects in which students, faculty and professionals from participating sponsoring companiessuch as adidas, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft and Vanscollaborate and innovate around emerging material technologies or future market opportunities.

Earlier in his career, Hacker was a product designer at Henry Dreyfus and Associates, JCPenney Company Inc. and GAF Corporation.

He is a proud board member of ArtCenters FullCircle group, committed to supporting ArtCenter students on their educational journey and developing successful career paths.

Hacker holds a Bachelor of Science in industrial design from the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture Art and Planning.

In the role of chair, Hacker will provide the creative, strategic and academic vision for the department and work closely with a diverse body of faculty to shape the curriculum to address the expanding role of product design in the industry and continue prioritizing sustainable design practices to minimize a products footprint on the planet.

The chair is responsible for ensuring educational excellence, the successful operations of a student-centered 8-term Bachelor of Science degree program responsive to the needs and goals of a culturally diverse student and faculty community. The chair also defines the mission of the department in alignment with the Colleges mission and strategic plan.

Hackers appointment follows an international search to identify and attract a diverse and highly qualified group of potential candidates from around the world.

270,"YEREVAN, Armenia (AP)  The Azerbaijani army closed in Thursday on a key town in Nagorno-Karabakh following more than a month of intense fighting, while top diplomats from Azerbaijan and Armenia prepared for more talks to try to end their long conflict over the separatist territory.

Nagorno-Karabakhs separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, said Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) of the strategically placed town of Shushi. He urged residents to mobilize all their resources to fend off the attack.

The one who controls Shushi controls Nagorno-Karabakh, Harutyunyan said in a video address from the towns cathedral, which was severely damaged by Azerbaijani shelling this month. We must realize that and take part in defending Shushi. We must reverse the situation.

Shushi is located about 5 kilometers south of Nagorno-Karabakhs regional capital, Stepanakert.

Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994.

The latest fighting began Sept. 27 and has involved heavy artillery, rockets and drones, in the largest escalation of hostilities over the separatist region in the quarter-century since the war ended. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people, have been killed in a little over a month.

Separatist authorities of Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azerbaijani forces Thursday of shelling Stepanakert, Shushi and Martakert with Smerch multiple rocket systems, a devastating Soviet-designed weapon intended to ravage wide areas with explosives and cluster munitions. Martakert was also raided by Azerbaijani aircraft, officials said.

Azerbaijans Defense Ministry denied using aviation and accused Armenian forces of shelling the Terter, Goranboy and Barda regions of Azerbaijan. One civilian was killed in the Goranboy region, according to Hikmet Hajiyev, a foreign policy advisor to the Azerbaijans president.

The ministry also reported downing two Armenian Su-25 warplanes, a claim Armenian officials rejected as disinformation.

According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, 1,166 of their troops and 39 civilians have been killed in the clashes so far. Azerbaijani authorities havent disclosed their military losses, but say the fighting has killed at least 90 civilians and wounded 392.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that, according to Moscows information, the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000, a significantly higher number than officially reported.

The hostilities have raged for a fifth week despite international calls for peace and three attempts at establishing a cease-fire. The latest U.S.-brokered truce frayed immediately after it took effect Monday, just like two previous cease-fires negotiated by Russia. The warring sides have repeatedly blamed each other for violations.

Russia, the United States and France have co-chaired the so-called Minsk Group set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate in the conflict, but they have failed to score any progress.

The Minsk Groups co-chairs were set to meet with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Geneva on Thursday, but the negotiations were pushed back until Friday and the prospects for a breakthrough appeared dim.

Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anna Naghdalyan said the change of date was linked to the evolving situation and logistical issues, adding that negotiating a lasting and verifiable cease-fire is a priority for Armenia.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedly criticized the Minsk Group for failing to achieve any results in three decades and insisted that Azerbaijan has the right to reclaim its territory by force since international mediation has failed.

Speaking Thursday at an investor conference in Moscow, Putin said that negotiating a settlement for the decades-long conflict is extremely challenging.

Its a tight knot, and there are no simple solutions, Putin said. Each side has its own truth.

Russia, which has a military base in Armenia and a security agreement to protect its ally, has been involved in a delicate diplomatic act while trying to also maintain good ties with Azerbaijan and to avoid a showdown with Turkey.

Before the latest escalation of hostilities, Russia proposed a peace plan that would see Azerbaijan reclaim control of several of its regions outside Nagorno-Karabakh that Armenian forces captured during the war that ended in 1994. In exchange, Nagorno-Karabakh would be given security guarantees and a crippling blockade of Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan would be lifted.

Armenia has resisted the plan.

Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, whose homes have been damaged by shelling, also appeared to have little faith in the international peace efforts.

Neither France nor Russia are doing anything. We are left alone, Vovik Zakharian, a resident of Shushi, a town that came under repeated shelling, said.

Zakharian, 72, inspected his apartment Thursday after it was damaged in morning strikes.

We will fight till the end, he said. We have to try our best.",nam

272,"Central campus of the university, where today only the faculty of law is located. These buildings were inspired by the famous buildings of Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Berlin.

The University of Oslo (Norwegian: Universitetet i Oslo; Latin: Universitas Osloensis), until 1939 named the Royal Frederick University (Norwegian: Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet; Latin: Universitas Regia Fredericiana), is the oldest university in Norway, located in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Until 1 January 2016 it was the largest Norwegian institution of higher education in terms of size, now surpassed only by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. [3] The Academic Ranking of World Universities has ranked it the 58th best university in the world and the third best in the Nordic countries. [4] In 2015, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked it the 135th best university in the world and the seventh best in the Nordics. [5] While in its 2016, Top 200 Rankings of European universities, the Times Higher Education listed the University of Oslo at 63rd, making it the highest ranked Norwegian university. [6]

The university has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. [7] Its faculties include (Lutheran) Theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), Law, Medicine, Humanities, Mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, Dentistry, and Education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as CICERO, NKVTS and the Frisch Centre.

The university was founded in 1811 and was modeled after the University of Copenhagen and the recently established University of Berlin. It was originally named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway and received its current name in 1939. The university is informally also known as Universitetet (""the university""), having been the only university in Norway, until 1946 and was commonly referred to as ""The Royal Frederick's"" (Det Kgl. Frederiks), prior to the name change.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and will be so again in 2020, making it the only university in the world to be involved in awarding a Nobel Prize. [8] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates. [9]

Early history[ edit ]

King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway was the founder of the university

In 1811, a decision was made to establish the first university in the Dano-Norwegian Union, after an agreement was reached with King Frederik VI, who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies. In 1813, The Royal Frederik's University was founded in Christiania (later renamed Oslo), a small city at that time. Circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement [ clarification needed ] of the university, as Norway proclaimed independence. However, independence was somewhat restricted, as Norway was obliged to enter into a legislative union with Sweden based on the outcome of the War of 1814. Norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions, although royal power and foreign affairs were shared [ clarification needed ] with Sweden. At a time when Norwegians feared political domination by the Swedes, the new university became a key institution that contributed to Norwegian political and cultural independence.

The main initial function of The Royal Frederick University was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants, as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers. The university also became the centre for a survey of the countrya survey of culture, language, history and folk traditions. The staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society. Throughout the 1800s, the university's academic disciplines gradually became more specialised.

One of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research, the management of the university became more professional, academic subjects were reformed, and the forms of teaching evolved. Classical education came under increasing pressure. [ clarification needed ]

When the union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security. Education, health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university's graduates.

19001945[ edit ]

Research changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods, scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research. It was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers. Scientific researchwhether to launch or test out new theories, to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplinesbecame part of the increased expectations placed on the university. Developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge, not merely competence in theology or law, for example. The university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation.

The position of rector was established by Parliament in 1905 following the Dissolution of the Union. Waldemar Christofer Brøgger was Professor of Geology and became the university's first rector. Brøgger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives. With the establishment of the national research council after World War II, Brøgger's vision was largely fulfilled; research received funding independent of teaching. This coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s, which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching. In the years leading up to 1940, research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation, with progress and self-assertion; research was also seen to contribute to Norway's commitment to international academic and cultural development.

During the period after World War I, research among Norwegian researchers resulted in two Nobel prizes. The Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch. The Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Odd Hassel. In the field of linguistics, several Norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally. Increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included Norway. Student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940, and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical, gender and social bases. The working class was still largely left behind, however.

During the German occupation, which lasted from 19401945, the university rector, Didrik Arup Seip, was imprisoned. The university was then placed under the management of Adolf Hoel, a NS (Norwegian Nazi Party) appointee. A number of students participated in the Norwegian resistance movement; after fire was set in the university auditorium, Reich Commissar Terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested. A number of students and teachers were detained by the Germans nearly until the end of the war.

19452000[ edit ]

After WWII, public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance; the State Educational Loan Fund for Young Students was established in 1947. As a result, the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers. Many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war; they could now enroll. For the 1945 autumn semester, 5951 students registered at the university. This represented the highest student enrollment at UiO up to that time. In 1947, the number had risen to more than 6000 students. This represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled prior to the war.

In no previous period had a single decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s. The decade represented an unparalleled period of growth. From 1960 to 1970, student enrollment tripled, rising from 5,600 to 16,800. This tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived, from both the inside and the outside. As it turned out, the changes were even more comprehensive. The university campus at Blindern was expanded, and the number of academic and administrative employees rose. The number of academic positions doubled, from fewer than 500 to around 1,200. The increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation. The expansion of the Blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students. The explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the Blindern campus in particular. The faculties situated in central OsloLaw and Medicineexperienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s, while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled.

By 1968, revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students. The ""Student Uprising"" became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world. Often, the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak. More than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models. The ""University of the Masses"" was unable to lift all its students to the ""lofty, elite positions"" enjoyed by previous generations of academics. Many students dissociated themselves, therefore, from the so-called ""establishment"" and the way the establishment functioned. Many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society. It was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged.

The most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of women students. Throughout the 1970s, the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students. At the same time, the university became a centre for the organised women's liberation movement, which emerged in the 1970s.

Up until the millennium, the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partially to the poor labour market.

The highest position at the university is Professor, i.e. ""full Professor."" In Norway, the title ""Professor,"" which is protected by law, is only used for full professors. Prior to 1990, all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the King-in-Council, i.e. by the King upon the advice of the Cabinet. The position below Professor was historically Docent (translated as Reader in a UK context and Professor in an American context). In 1985, all Docents became full professors. The most common positions below that are førsteamanuensis (translated as Associate Professor), and amanuensis or universitetslektor (translated as Lecturer or Assistant Professor). At the University of Oslo, almost all new permanent positions are announced at the Associate Professor level; an associate professor may apply for promotion to full professor if he or she holds the necessary competence.

Additionally, there are temporary, qualifying positions such as stipendiat (Research Fellow) and postdoktor (Postdoctoral Fellow).

A small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks researcher, senior researcher and research professor, which correspond to assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.

Several other less common academic positions also exist. Historically, only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university. Originally, all professors were automatically members of the Collegium Academicum, the highest governing body of the university, but soon afterwards its membership was limited. Docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. In 1975, the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies, as the last group. Formerly by law, and now by tradition, the highest positions, such as Rector or Dean, are only held by professors. They are elected by the academic community (academics and students) and by the technical-administrative support staff, but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight.

The university's research structure consists of eight schools, or ""faculties."" They are the Faculties of Dentistry, Educational Sciences, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Theology. [10]

The university's old campus, strongly influenced by Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel 's neoclassical style, is located in the centre of Oslo near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace and the Parliament. The old campus was then occupied by the Faculty of Law and most of the other faculties have been transferred to the Blindern campus in the suburban West End, erected in the 1930s. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area.

The Faculty of Theology sponsors 8 research groups in the following fields: [11]

The university is home to five Nobel Prize winners and is institutionally tied to some of the most prestigious prizes in the world. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's atrium between 1947 and 1989, thus making it the only university to host a Nobel Prize ceremony. [13] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the university's atrium.

In July 2015, the University received intense criticism for allowing Anders Behring Breivik to be admitted to study for a 3-year baccalaureate degree in political science (including courses on democracy, human rights, and respect for minorities). He is the perpetrator of the 22 July, 2011 Norway attacks, Norway's worst incident of violence since World War II; he received 21 years in prison (he can be paroled after 10 years; but he can be confined after the 21 years are up, allowable for five years at a time, if he is viewed as still dangerous, resulting in an actual life sentence). The Rector said they were obliged to follow the regulations, which allowed it because his grades were good enough. It will be done in solitary confinement, with guards delivering his assignments and the finished work and the grades. [14] In October 2018, it was reported that course materials were being provided to Breivik by a prison officer and that he had no contact with students or academics or access to the internet. [15]

Some of the notable academics of the university are:

Vilhelm Aubert (Professor of Sociology)
Fredrik Barth (Professor of Social Anthropology)
Jon Bing (Professor of Law; pioneer of legal informatics)
Nils Christie (Professor of Criminology)
Ole-Johan Dahl (Professor of Computer Science)

275,"TRAVELLERS from Denmark have been barred from entering the UK after wide-scale outbreaks of a new strain of Covid-19 at mink factories.

The development - a 'virologist's worst nightmare' - has resulted in the first-ever travel ban implemented by Britain during the pandemic.

5

It comes after health officials say the new strain shows decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the effectiveness of future vaccines.

A genetically stable virus - as has been the case so far - is a steady target for scientists working to develop a jab. But the news from Denmark could change the goalposts for experts.

Downing Street had already taken action to remove Denmark from the travel corridor, forcing arrivals to isolate for two weeks from Friday at 4am.

But following a Covid committee meeting on Friday afternoon, No10 now has banned all non-British national or resident travellers who have been in or transited through Denmark in the past 14 days.

Throughout the pandemic, officials have warned against all but essential travel to countries with rising cases.

Initially, quarantine measures were put in place for people arriving to the UK from early hotspots China and Italy.

However, it's the first time an outright ban has been announced.

Brits in Denmark are allowed to return, and the first flight affected - British Airways flight 811 from Copenhagen - touched down at Heathrow shortly before 8am on Saturday.

But all travellers who have been to the country in the past fortnight - as well as all members of their household - must now isolate for 14 days.

Meanwhile, NHS test and trace will prioritise contacting all those who have recently returned.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter: This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms.

""Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority.

England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty is understood to be particularly worried about the situation in Denmark.

Authorities in the country recently found a mutated form of coronavirus that can pass to humans in mink farms.

Millions of the animals are to be slaughtered after the strain was discovered at more than 200 Danish mink farms.

And it's sparked a fresh lockdown in parts of the country, where bars, restaurants, public transport and all public indoor sports will be closed in seven North Jutland municipalities.

The restrictions will come into effect from today and initially last for a month - until December 3.

The World Health Organisation said mink appear to be ""good reservoirs"" of coronavirus.

Around five new strains of the virus have been found - and at least 12 people were infected with the virus as a direct result so far.

5

Despite that, officials believe the situation could be much worse than they already know.

Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said about half of the 783 human cases reported in north Denmark related to a strain of the virus that originated in the mink farms.

And the country's prime minister Mette Frederiksen said there were now fears that the new, mutated virus posed a ""risk to the effectiveness"" of a future vaccine.

""It is very, very serious,"" she added.

""The mutated virus in mink can have devastating consequences worldwide.

We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well.""

Denmark is one of the world's main mink fur exporters - producing millions of furs per year.

Police said the culling of the 15 million mink should happen as soon as possible and would cost the nation around £600m.

A spokeswoman from the Department for Transport said: Unlike other travel to the UK, there will be no exemptions to this quarantine policy.

The UK Government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the UK to inform our risk assessments.

Under England's new national lockdown, all international travel is prohibited - unless it's for business.

Anyone going on a break away faces a £200 fine for doing so, it was revealed this week.

The decision comes after Germany and Sweden were chucked off the travel corridor list too, forcing anyone returning to isolate for two weeks.

Ministers are poised to slash this with a new testing routine, but it's not set to be in place for weeks to come.",nam
276,"China News Service, April 21, the fifth issue of variety show ""Hope Search Word"" was launched on CCTV-3 (variety channel) on the 20th. The search word for hope in the fifth issue is ""health hope"". In the show, Liu Tao showed a variety of ""handstand stunts"", supporting the wall and hanging upside down skills. She said that ""you must find some fun things to do in busy time."" Exercise is a great way to get healthy while playing.

Chen He, who was previously jokingly called ""fat"" by fans, focused on ""Happy Fitness"". In the video, he carefully prepared a series of fitness programs, but repeatedly ""finished"" because of ""too difficult"", and the laughing picture made the audience ""laugh out the abdominal muscles"". In the end, he stated that ""the purpose of his own fitness is to be happy,"" and Nigmatti quipped: ""For the first time, I saw such a big story of laziness.""

The fifth episode of the program is designed to encourage everyone to really move, not just to hang on to the movement. Liu Yan, who has always been serious about fitness, appeared in the program and passed on her secrets of fitness. At home, she is not idle, and a few bottles of water and books can become her fitness tools.

Chen He

In addition, netizens also actively responded to the call for ""new hope for health"", and the feedback of fitness videos was varied. When dumping garbage, a feather duster can turn a sword into a ""girl""; some fancy push-ups and back-and-forth flips make the action amazing. The show connected with a netizen who cooperates with dogs at home. She cooperates with dogs squat and tablet support. She said that this fitness method is full of fun, and she called on everyone to respond to the theme of ""health hope"".

At the end of the show, Professor Yang Fengchi brought advice on post-epidemic health from a professional perspective. During the anti-epidemic period, it is necessary to combine fitness and good mentality in order to live full of positive energy.",nam
277,"Bangladesh's story is one of miraculous success, especially in terms of macro and micro indicators of economic and social development. Beginning with a mere $100 per capita income in the early 1970s, today Bangladesh can boast about crossing the World Bank-defined low-income economy threshold by achieving $1,200-plus per capita income.

The growth performance of Bangladesh has also been spectacular, with average annual growth of 6.14 percent over the past 12 years, and what is more remarkable is that the standard deviation of the growth rate in that time was as low as a quarter of a percent. This is lowest not only in South Asia but also in the global context.

Bangladesh also experienced strong external sector gains with positive balance of payments (BOP) current account balance and a record foreign exchange reserve of more than $26 billion.

Poverty has declined from around the 80 percent range in the early 1970s to 25 percent, and extreme poverty is estimated to have fallen below 13 percent in 2015. Life expectancy rose by 10 years, from 59 to 69; girls' education increased significantly and performance in reducing infant mortality rate and post-natal deaths has become a global role model.

As far as the demographic dividend is concerned, Bangladesh is at a vantage point as majority of the population is young. The economy is transforming in a big way wherein agriculture is no longer the dominant source of employment and income.

Bangladesh for its sustained growth has achieved Ba3 (Moody's) and BB- (Standard and Poor's) with a stable outlook for the sixth consecutive year. Stable real GDP growth and strong external balances have helped Bangladesh achieve BB- rating with stable outlook from Fitch Ratings for the second time this year.

While there is no doubt about the growth potential of Bangladesh, the question is how to capitalise all these positive features to a higher growth trajectory and sustain the momentum to consolidate Bangladesh's position as a solid middle-income country in the next 15 years.

The major challenges Bangladesh faces today are climate change and sustainable development. But there are other issues such as macroeconomic stability, public and private investment, domestic resource mobilisation, infrastructure development, and poverty reduction.

There two other issues that pose serious challenge to growth -- money laundering and terrorist financing. These issues are major threats to the integrity of our financial system, and they are not just issues of concern locally.

In fact, over the past twenty years crimes related to money laundering and terrorist financing have emerged as potential threats to global economy. As we are living in a globalised world, every concern that affects others has a deep impact on us as well.

The first convention titled Vienna Convention to combat money laundering was signed in 1998 and became effective in 1990 with signatories including the EU and G7 countries. In relation to that an international body -- Financial Action Task Force (FATF) -- was established to oversee the implementation of the principles of the convention. The issue of combating terrorist financing was taken into serious consideration immediately after the 9/11 incident on the World Trade Centre in 2001.

The FATF is responsible for developing an international standard for anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism issues and works closely with other global organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and United Nations. The FATF has also regional bodies for effective coordination globally. In 1997 the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on money laundering was established.

In line with international efforts, Bangladesh has taken a number of initiatives to prevent money laundering and combat terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Bangladesh is a founding member of APG and first in the South Asian region to promulgate Money Laundering Prevention Act in line with recommendations from FATF in 2002. Since 1997, Bangladesh has been regularly participating annual plenary meetings of APG. The Money Laundering Prevention Act was replaced by the Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance in 2008, and the Anti-Terrorism Ordinance was also enacted the same year. These two were later passed by the parliament as Money Laundering Prevention Act and Anti-Terrorism Act in 2009, after which Bangladesh issued Money Laundering Prevention Rules and formulated Anti-Terrorism Rules in 2013.

The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit was established in 2012 to receive, analyse and disseminate suspicious transaction reports, cash transaction reports and complaints. Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit is responsible for exchanging information related to money laundering and terrorist financing with its foreign counterparts. The intelligence unit has also achieved membership of Egmont Group in 2013. The purpose of the group is to provide a forum for financial intelligent units of government organisations of different countries to improve support for each other.

Bangladesh had its first mutual evaluation by a joint team from World Bank and IMF in 2002, and adoption by Asia-Pacific Group in 2003 followed by a second mutual evaluation in 2008.

Bangladesh's banking sector has come of age and when it comes to adopting international best practices this sector has always been pioneer. What is important now is to identify and assess the existing, emerging and also future risks and look closely into vulnerabilities within the current banking practices and procedures.

In the wake of recent incidents, we have to be extra cautious about money laundering and financing of terrorist. It is high time for banks to prioritise unity against money laundering and terrorist financing activities to protect the integrity and stability of Bangladesh's financial system.

Money launderers and terrorist financiers exploit loopholes and move their funds to or through jurisdictions with weak or ineffective legal and institutional frameworks.

Money laundering has potentially devastating economic, security, and social consequences. It allows drug dealers, smugglers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, and corrupt officials to operate and expand their networks.

Money laundering diminishes government tax revenue and thereby indirectly harms honest taxpayers. This also makes government tax collection much more difficult because the loss of revenue means higher tax rates, and corruption-inflated higher costs of public works.

Money laundering distorts assets and commodity prices and leads to misallocation of resources. This creates an unstable liability base and unsound asset structures for financial institutions, creating risks of monetary instability and even systemic crisis. This crisis further leads to loss of credibility and investors' confidence and the potential of destabilising financial systems, particularly in emerging economies.

The social and political cost of money laundering is serious as this money may be used to corrupt national institutions. Laundered money is also spent as kickbacks to government officials, which undermines the moral fabric in society.

The banking sector is now in the process of implementing Basel III. Automation is one key tool for combating money laundering and terrorist financing and recent progress in the banking sector is noteworthy.

The major achievements in automations include an automated Credit Information Bureau, introduction of LC monitoring system, and modernisation of payment systems.

A delegation of Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering is visiting Bangladesh now to review the preventive steps taken by the Bangladesh government against militancy and terrorism finance and the effectiveness of the banking sector in implementing legal, regulatory and operational measures for the same.

As a nation we cannot afford to have our country's image tarnished because of money laundering and terrorist financing issues, especially in today's global economy. We have to be vigilant and guard the integrity of our financial system for financial and social stability. Failure to effectively combat these dark forces will have adverse impact on us, like our international ratings will go down, and we will lose competitive advantages: cost of foreign trade will be higher, foreign loans will fall, and most importantly, the country's image will suffer. And we cannot afford to have that when we are moving forward to achieve the middle-income country status by 2021.",nam

[16] [17] During the campaign, Tokayev was mocked on social media for his use of photo manipulation software to erase his wrinkles and double chin from official photos. [18] Tokayev was elected president of Kazakhstan on 9 June with 71% of the popular vote. [4] He was congratulated by foreign heads of state such as Xi Jinping, Ilham Aliyev, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Emomali Rahmon, and Sooronbay Jeenbekov. [19] [20] [21] [22]

President Tokayev delivered his first state-of-the-nation address on 2 September 2020. [23] The address focused on strengthening civil society and social security, supporting domestic business and economic development.

In October 2019, it was announced that all potential ministerial candidates needed the approval of Nazarbayev before being appointed, with the exception of Minister of Defence, Interior Minister and Foreign Minister. [24] After the Bek Air Flight 2100 crash, Tokayev declared the following day, 28 December, a national day of mourning and said that ""all those responsible will be severely punished in accordance with the law"". [25] He also ordered the suspension of the flight authorization of Bek Air, the domestic airline involved. [26]

On 29 February 2020, in an interview to ""Informburo"" news agency, Tokayev commented on the fate of Mukhtar Dzhakishev: ""This issue is exclusively within the competence of the court. Of course, I am aware that Dzhakishev has repeatedly applied for parole on ill-health. The session of the court of first instance will be held on 3 March. Lets wait for its decision, which I am sure will be fair."" On 3 March 2020, the Court of the Semey city upheld the motion to grant parole to Dzhakishev. He served a 14-year prison sentence since 2009.

On 15 March 2020, due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, President Tokayev signed a Decree on the introduction of a state of emergency in the country. The state of emergency will remain in effect from 16 March to 15 April. On 16 March 2020, during his televised address to the people of Kazakhstan, President Tokayev stressed that he had signed a special decree on measures to ensure the stability of the state functioning. These documents enable us to increase the efficiency of state bodies, strengthen the vertical of power and make all necessary decisions promptly in a manual mode.

In the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in Kazakhstan in 2020, Tokayev ordered the cancellations of both the Nowruz celebrations as well as the military parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. [27] [28] [29]

On 2 May 2020, Nazarbayev's daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva was removed from the Senate and her role as the Chair by order of President Tokayev. [30] Many theories arose that this was a sign of either Tokayev was expanding his political influence or a growing feud between the ruling elite. [31]

Political reforms[ edit ]

In May 2020, President Tokayev signed the laws On the procedure for organizing and holding peaceful assemblies in the Republic of Kazakhstan, On introducing amendments to the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, On Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan, and On introducing amendments and additions to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan On Political Parties. [32] The new laws are an important part of the measures to strengthen the states democratic foundations, and enhance the role of civil society. [32] In his state of the nation address, he emphasised that ""Kazakhstan must create a multiparty system to build a modern, effective state"", also saying that the ruling Nur Otan party should collaborate more with other parties. [33] [34]

President Tokayev advocated political reforms that would promote the concept of a ""state that listens"" to civil society creating a constructive dialogue. [35] Tokayev initiated the establishment of the new National Council of Public Trust to facilitate this dialogue. [35]

Foreign policy[ edit ]

Tokayev and Moon Jae In in Nur-Sultan.

President Tokayev pledged continuity of foreign policy initiated by President Nazarbayev. This means the continuation of measures to attract foreign investments, multi-vector foreign policy and ensuring security in the region. [36] In his first month in office, he had already met 4 world leaders, 2 of them abroad and the other two in Nur-Sultan. Two weeks after taking office, Tokayev visited Moscow in his first foreign state visit on 4 April, meeting with Putin alongside other Russian officials. [37] During the visit, Putin offered Russian assistance to Tokayev in the construction of a proposed nuclear power plant in the country. [38] On 14 April, Tokayev visited neighboring Uzbekistan for talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. [39] He had also received South Korean President Moon Jae In and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during the month of April. On 1617 May, Tokayev hosted foreign leaders such as Armen Sarkissian and Mamuka Bakhtadze in the capital for the 12th annual Astana Economic Forum, the first to be hosted by its pioneer, President Nazarbayev. [40] He also hosted the regional leaders of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Armenia and Moldova for the Eurasian Economic Union and Supreme Eurasian Economic Council summit on 29 May. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan in late 2019, he visited the House-Museum of Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov in Bishkek, where he met with the late writer's wife and reminisced about his first encounters with Aitmatov in Beijing in 1989. [41] On 4 December, on the eve of a state visit to Germany, he gave an interview to Deutsche Welle, in which he called Germany a ""key European partner for Kazakhstan"". [42] In that same interview, he drew controversy by saying that he did not believe the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation was an invasion while also saying that he believed in the ""wisdom of the Russian leadership"", drawing condemnation from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who issued a demarche in response. [43]

The President maintained strong relations with Kazakhstan's strategic allies, including the U.S. In June 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated President Tokayev on his one-year anniversary of presidency. In his congratulatory letter, Trump expressed his support for the reforms that had been undertaken in Kazakhstan, and reaffirmed his intention to further develop strategic partnership between the two countries.

280,"Deep Learning

Financial services have been revolutionised over the last 20 years by increasingly powerful technology such as big data analytics, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning. Now, Fintech is on the cusp of a truly revolutionary moment, the integration of AI and deep learning into financial services. This combination really has the potential to revolutionise money and the global financial landscape in ways we never could have imagined 20 years ago. This is hardly by accident, a 2015 report by Accenture tracked the global investment in Fintech; revealing it has jumped from $930 million in 2008 to over $12 billion by the start of 2015.

Data Explosion

The explosion of data over the last 10 years has been incredible, and has been so vast that there has been little way to comprehend it without intelligent automated support. As analytics advances, so does the need for increased computational power to crunch the big numbers, and AI systems are becoming easier and easier to develop adapt and integrate.

Many companies already use programs like Kasisto, a KAI powered conversational UX, to help to improve customer service and connect customers to products and services. Kasisto are currently pioneering the use of their bot to help people manage stocks and portfolios (check it out here). However, this has been around for a few years now, and it really only scratches the surface of how AI is going to transform Fintech. AI and Machine Learning is being applied across the financial world, this is the next step in financial evolution. Fintech start-ups such as Affirm, Zest Finance, and Kensho, have applied deep learning to improve decision making and financial processing. Zest Finance are redefining credit scores and challenging the use of  little data , using big data analytics to provide a much more accurate credit score than is possible in the current system.

Machine Learning Algorithms

One of the key features of emerging start-ups has been the use of machine learning algorithms to gain an analytical edge in trading. What tends to vary is the proposed clientele. For example, start-ups like Binatix are aimed more at large data sets and analytics for portfolio and hedge fund management on a wider scale; whereas Williamsburg based Inovance, is attempting to bring machine learning based trading analytics to the rescue of common investors. Similarly, earlier this year, Alpaca (deep learning Fintech start-up) launched Capitalico; a deep learning trading platform, that allows traders to automate their trade ideas without any programming or market investing experience.

This theme runs throughout the evolution of finance, banking is becoming ever-more personalised. Smart wallets like Wallet.ai will help you consider, analyse, price, and consider every single thing you purchase, in a way that no bank, financial advisor or human assistant could begin to attempt. Following many years of having offshored repetitive tasks to lower-cost locations, PWC have predicted that this financial revolution will lead to reshoring and localisation of banking again thanks to the falling costs of automation and AI innovation.

AI analytics can be applied across the entire financial world, the next level of disruption has arrived, and it spells the end for banking as we know it. In the coming years we will see deep learning infiltrate identity authentication, portfolio construction, automated investment, fraud detection, and transactional safety; not a stone will lay un-turned in the financial world. PWC has predicted that the next three to five years are likely to lay the foundations, with modest, evolutionary gains, followed by rapid expansion as the technology becomes cheaper, more widely available, and more accepted by the general populace. The partnership of deep learning and Fintech is still very young, who knows where it could take us?",nam
281,"Money laundering is a very serious criminal activity.

Most people have heard of the term money laundering, but many would need a dictionary (or Wikipedia) to actually tell you what it meant.

Relative to how severe a crime it is, money laundering isnt really that complicated, and is much more prevalent than you might think.

How Does Money Laundering Work? What Even Is It?

A criminal has just inherited a large amount of money illegally. Simply depositing it into a personal or business account of his will assuredly raise suspicion at his bank. So would not claiming it on his taxes, something that might be difficult to explain to the authorities.

So, what does that criminal do with his dirty money? Clean it, of course.

Simply put: money laundering is taking illegally-obtained money and making it look like it was earned legally instead.

This is done by criminals through certain kinds of transactions, investments in assets, and other moves that hide the original source of the funds.

The end result is money that looks legal and is able to be used without raising the suspicion of authorities.

The term allegedly came from notorious mobster Al Capone, who liked to hide his illegal profits as legitimate income in the many laundromats he owned.

Today the term is something of an umbrella term to describe many different methods of deceiving the law about where money came from.

Laundering is a big problem.

In the United States alone, an estimated $300 billion is laundered annually through banks and similar institutions, which accounts for 2% of the countrys entire economy.

Globally, estimates go as high as $2 trillion, or as much as 5% of the worlds GDP.

The advent of digital banking and cash management has made moving money quickly and covertly easier than ever by criminals, making laundering one of the biggest crimes of our time. And with the rise of online gambling, there has been a huge increase in money laundering through online casinos.

The Three Steps of Laundering

Even though the practice has been around for centuries and has gotten increasingly complex, there are still just three basic steps that criminals employ to launder money: placement, layering and integration.

Once dirty money is obtained by criminals, placement is the first step.

This involves putting the funds into a bank account registered to a business (real or otherwise) or to a middleman.

This step is where most would-be launderers get caught, as putting large amounts of money into these accounts out of nowhere generally looks suspicious if not done carefully.

Next the money needs to be layered, or exchanged through multiple transactions so that its original source cant be traced.

Theres many ways that criminals tend to do this, including dispersing the funds to many different bank accounts or buying expensive assets like houses or cars.

Finally, the launderer seeks to get their now-clean money back through integration.

More transactions are made that re-direct the money back to the criminal. Sometimes this may take the form of a salary as head of a newly created business or nonprofit. Other times it may be invested in legitimate businesses, complete with fake invoices attempting to show the money was genuine income.

Ways Criminals Do It

While the basic three steps dont vary that much, theres a huge variety of ways criminals go about laundering their money.

Structuring: During the placement step, the money is broken down into several smaller deposits in order to better avoid detection.

Often this is done by way of purchasing securities like money orders that are then re-deposited again in small quantities.

Casinos and Gambling: The dirty money is converted into chips at a casino, played with for a short while, then cashed out in the form of a check.

Sometimes this is also done through fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as players play and lose a little bit, then cash out so they have a receipt to show as proof of their winnings.

Round-Tripping: Money is placed into the account of a foreign business, then received back as a tax-exempt foreign direct investment.

It can also be when two companies agree between one another to sell and then buy back an asset at the same price. Sometimes this is called a lazy susan.

Cash-Intensive Businesses: Criminal businesses that tend to receive large influxes of cash sneak in illegal money into their accounts, mixing it in with legally earned money.

Common businesses used for this method are strip clubs, casinos, and car washes (as Pacino did and also Walt and Skyler in Breaking Bad).

There are many other ways of laundering, and its a practice thats constantly evolving especially as financial transactions shift to being more digitally-based.

Detection and Punishment

In most western nations, laundering money wasnt actually a crime until the 1980s and 1990s.

Before that, governments were more likely to pin criminals with a similar crime (like tax evasion) if they were suspicious of large amounts of crime-created money being moved.

Prevention measures in many countries require all transactions over a specified amount ($10,000 in the U.S.) to be reported by banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and similar.

Laws also require that banking institutions take actions to confirm the real identity of their customers and businesses. Should a transaction seem unordinary for that particular person, a suspicious activity report is often filed.

These reports usually go to a financial crimes agency or task force that analyzes the data to determine if investigative action should be taken.

Many anti-laundering recommendations are also put forth by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an international organization devoted to stopping laundering.

Punishments for laundering also vary wildly by country, especially since its often done in conjunction with another crime (like tax evasion and whatever was done to originally obtain the dirty money).

In the United States, cases that strictly involve just laundering are punishable by a maximum of 14 years in prison.

For financial institutions, even just neglecting to report activity that might be laundering can carry up to five years.

The Future of Laundering

Some of the proclaimed benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are that transactions are anonymous and not controlled or regulated by any central organization.

However, these strengths are also weaknesses in that criminals can more easily launder money via the digital currencies, which is why governments are working quickly to pass cryptocurrency regulation.

Many countries like China, Russia, Canada, and others have already passed or proposed anti-laundering laws pertaining to digital money.

As cryptocurrencies see an uptick in popularity and usage, it will be interesting to see how governments attempt to stop criminals from using them to launder money.

Somewhat ironically, the person who actually figures out how to do that will likely make a lot money.

So.. the next time someone asks you: How does money laundering work? Youll be able to tell them its not as complicated as they might think!",nam
282,"A ranking of destinations for attractiveness to foreign investors has placed India at the top among 110 countries. China has secured the 65th position and the U.S. is at the 50th. In the 2014 index, India was at the sixth position and Hong Kong was number one.

The ranking is based on an index for baseline profitability that assumes that three factors affect the ultimate success of a foreign investment: how much the value of an asset grows; the preservation of that value while the asset is owned; and the ease of repatriation of proceeds from selling the asset. The index combines measures for each of these factors into a summary statistic that conveys a countrys basic attractiveness for investment.

Investment guidance
Where exactly should they [investors] put their money? The Baseline Profitability Index (BPI) is back for its third year with some answers, and Narendra Modis India is the place to start, wrote Daniel Altman, creator of the index and an Adjunct Professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, in the Foreign Policy magazine.

...economic growth alone doesnt determine the returns to investing abroad; you have to worry about things like financial stability, physical security, corruption, expropriation by government, exploitation by local partners, capital controls, and exchange rates as well. Putting all of these factors together gives a better idea of how big the return will be when it finally reaches your pocket, he wrote.

The big story in the BPI in 2015 is India coming out on top, with growth forecasts up, perceptions of corruption down, and investors better protected following the election of a government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

High returns
A high ranking indicates high returns and improving economic institutions. The index, thus, compares how local policies and conditions affect the same investment in different countries. Or how the value of the principal and the return will change depending only on where the investment is made.

Local factors can erode profits. These include payment of bribes and kickbacks, the risk of which is compared across countries using the Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index, a measure for the perceived levels of public-sector corruption worldwide. In 2014, the country was at the 85th position out of 175 countries as compared to its ranking of 94 out of 177 in 2013.

World Bank index
BPI calculation also uses an index of investor protection compiled by the World Bank. In 2014, the average BPI score across all countries was 0.99; this year it is 1.03  meaning the expected returns over the next five years are about three-quarters of a per cent higher a year.

The calculation of the BPI is an imperfect exercise fraught with assumptions, Mr. Altman says.

For example, how does a survey about perceptions of corruption translate into likelihoods of having to pay bribes, and how big might those bribes be? he wrote when he first introduced the index.

Lower rank in Corruption Index helped India

India came first in the Baseline Profitability Index helped by its improved ranking in the Transparency Internationals Corruption Perception Index  in 2014, the country was at the 85th position out of 175 countries as compared to its ranking of 94 out of 177 countries in 2013.

The calculation of the BPI is an imperfect exercise fraught with assumptions, Daniel Altman, its creator, says. For example, how does a survey about perceptions of corruption translate into likelihoods of having to pay bribes, and how big might those bribes be? he wrote when he first introduced the index.

In 2014, the average BPI score across all countries was 0.99; this year it is 1.03  meaning the expected returns over the next five years are about three-quarters of a per cent higher a year.",nam
283,"Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta (born 26 October 1961) is a Kenyan politician, and current President of the Republic of Kenya. [1] He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gatundu South from 2002 to 2013. Currently, he is a member and the party leader of the Jubilee Party of Kenya. Uhuru was previously associated with the Kenya Africa National Union before joining The National Alliance, one of the allied parties that campaigned for his reelection during the 2017 general elections.

He is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first President, and his fourth wife Mama Ngina Kenyatta. [2] He is married to his wife Margaret Gakuo Kenyatta since 1991 and together they have three children namely; Jomo, Jaba and Ngina. Uhuru was re-elected for a second term in the August 2017 general election, winning 54% of the popular vote. [3] [4] The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Wafula Chebukati. [5] [6] However, Uhuru's election was successfully challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling. A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39% participation.

Early life[ edit ]

Uhuru is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's founding father and the first president of the republic of Kenya (in office 19641978), with his fourth wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta. His family hails from the Kikuyu, a Bantu ethnic group. His given name "" Uhuru"" is from the Swahili term for ""freedom"", and was given to him in anticipation of Kenya's upcoming independence. Uhuru attended St Mary's School in Nairobi. Between 1979 and 1980, he also briefly worked as a teller at the Kenya Commercial Bank. [7]

After St. Mary's school, Uhuru went on to study economics, political science and government at Amherst College in the United States. [8] [9] [2] Upon his graduation, Uhuru returned to Kenya, and started a company Wilham Kenya Limited, through which he sourced and exported agricultural produce. [10]

Uhuru was nominated to Parliament in 2001, he became Minister for Local Government under President Daniel Arap Moi and, despite his political inexperience, was favoured by Moi as his successor. [11] Kenyatta ran as KANU's candidate in the December 2002 presidential election, but lost to the opposition candidate Mwai Kibaki by a big margin. [12] He subsequently became Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. He backed Kibaki for re-election in the December 2007 presidential election and was named Minister of Local Government by Kibaki in January 2008, before becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade in April 2008 as part of a coalition government. [13]

Subsequently, Kenyatta was Minister of Finance from 2009 to 2012, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. Accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of committing crimes against humanity in relation to the violent aftermath of the 2007 election, he resigned as Minister of Finance on 26 January 2012. [14] He was elected as President of Kenya in the March 2013 presidential election, defeating Raila Odinga with a slim majority in a single round of voting.

In the 1997 general election, Uhuru Kenyatta contested the Gatundu South Constituency parliamentary seat, once held by his father, but lost to Moses Mwihia, a Nairobi architect. [15]

In 1999, Moi appointed Uhuru to chair the Kenya Tourism Board, a government parastatal. In 2001, he was nominated as a Member of Parliament, and he joined the Cabinet as Minister for Local Government. [16] He would also later be elected First Vice Chairman of KANU. [16]

In the nomination process in 2002 in what was widely thought as undemocratic and underhand, Moi influenced Uhuru Kenyatta's nomination as KANU 's preferred presidential candidate, sparking an outcry from other interested contenders and a massive exit from the party. This move by Moi was seen as a ploy to install Uhuru as a puppet so that even in retirement, Moi would still rule the country through Uhuru and presumably insulate himself against charges of abuse of office that plagued his presidency.

Uhuru finished second to Mwai Kibaki in the General Elections, with 31% of the vote. [17] [18] He conceded defeat and took up an active leadership role as Leader of the Opposition. [15]

In January 2005, Uhuru Kenyatta defeated Nicholas Biwott for chairmanship of KANU, taking 2,980 votes among party delegates against Biwott's 622 votes. [19]

Uhuru led his party KANU in the referendum campaigns against the draft constitution in 2005, having teamed up with the Liberal Democratic Party, a rebel faction in the Kibaki government, to form the Orange Democratic Movement. The result of this was a vote against the adoption of the draft constitution by a noticeable margin, which was a great political embarrassment to Emilio Mwai Kibaki.

In November 2006, Kenyatta was displaced as KANU leader by Biwott. [20] [21] On 28 December 2006, the High Court of Kenya reinstated Uhuru Kenyatta as KANU chairman. However, further court proceedings followed. [22] On 28 June 2007, the High Court confirmed Kenyatta as party leader, ruling that there was insufficient evidence for Biwott's argument that Kenyatta had joined another party. [23]

In the run up to the 2007 general election, he led KANU to join a coalition (called Party of National Unity""PNU"") with President Mwai Kibaki who was running for a second term against Raila Odinga. [24] PNU won the controversial 2007 elections but the dispute over the poll resulted in the 200708 Kenyan crisis. [25] [26] Under an agreement between the two parties to end the chaos, Kibaki remained as president in a power sharing agreement with Raila as Prime Minister, while Uhuru Kenyatta was Kibaki's choice as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister For Finance in his share of Cabinet slots. [16] [27]

ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo charged Uhuru, who was a PNU leader, as an indirect co-perpetrator in the violence that followed the 200708 Kenyan crisis, and the charges were confirmed on 23 January 2012. [28] The Prosecutor also charged William Ruto who had been a supporter of ODM, rivals of the PNU in the 2007 election. [29] Uhuru resigned as Minister of Finance upon the confirmation of the charges but maintained his innocence. [30] The charges were dropped on 13 March 2015 for lack of evidence. [31]

On 13 September 2007, Uhuru Kenyatta withdrew from the December 2007 presidential election in favour of Kibaki for re-election. [32] He said that he did not want to run unless he could be sure of winning. [33]

Following the election, amidst the controversy that resulted when Kibaki was declared the victor despite claims of fraud from challenger Raila Odinga and his Orange Democratic Movement, Kibaki appointed Kenyatta as Minister for Local Government on 8 January 2008. [34] After Kibaki and Odinga reached a power-sharing agreement, Kenyatta was named Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade on 13 April 2008, as part of the Grand Coalition Cabinet. He was the Deputy Prime Minister representing the PNU, while another Deputy Prime Minister, Musalia Mudavadi, represented the ODM. [35] [36] [37]

Kenyatta and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in on 17 April. [38] [39] Uhuru Kenyatta was later moved from Local Government and appointed Minister for Finance on 23 January 2009. [40] During his tenure, he spearheaded a number of reform measures that changed how treasury and government by extension transact business, such as the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and a fund for the inclusion of the informal sector in the mainstream economy.

In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was elected as the 4th and current president of Kenya under The National Alliance (TNA), which was part of the Jubilee Alliance with his running mate William Ruto 's United Republican Party (URP). [41] Uhuru and Ruto won 50.07% of votes cast, with closest rivals, Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy garnering 42%. [42] Raila Amolo Odinga disputed the election results at the Supreme Court which however held (70) that the election of Uhuru was valid and such irregularities as existed did not make a difference to the final outcome. [1] Uhuru Kenyatta was therefore sworn in as president on 9 April 2013. [43]

Uhuru ran for president in the elections held on 4 March 2013 and garnered 6,173,433 votes (50.03%) out of the 12,338,667 votes cast. As this was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold, he won the election in the first round thus evading a run-off between the top two candidates. [44] He was, therefore, declared the fourth President of the Republic of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).

According to the IEBC, Raila Odinga garnered 5,340,546 votes (43.4%) and was thus the second in the field of eight candidates. CORD, under the leadership of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, lodged a petition with the Supreme Court of Kenya on 10 March 2013 challenging Uhuru's election. [45] On 30 March 2013, Dr Willy Mutunga, the Chief Justice of Kenya, read the unanimous Supreme Court ruling declaring the election of Uhuru Kenyatta and his running-mate, William Ruto, as valid. [46] On 11 August 2017, the Chairman of the IEBC, Wafula Chebukati announced Uhuru's reelection to a second term in office during the 2017 Kenyan general election, with 54% of the popular vote. [3] [4] This was later contested in court and annulled. In the events that followed the annulment, Kenyatta was seen as lacking direction and being a reactionary leader. [ citation needed ] Following this annulment, a second election was required in which Uhuru Kenyatta won with 98% of the vote with a 39% voter turnout. [47]

On 9 March 2018 Uhuru Kenyatta agreed on a truce between the opposition leader, Raila Odinga. [48] This action marked the country's watershed moment that redrew its political architecture. [49] On 27 November 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) in Bomas of Kenya. [50] This is one of the results between him and the opposition leader Raila Odinga as its implementations will foresee some amendments in the Kenyan Constitution. [51]

Although it has been claimed that Uhuru was one of the few ministers who had no scandals attached to their name, [52] on 29 April 2009, he faced a controversial scare after he presented a supplemental budget that was inadvertently approved by the parliament. The budget was aimed to bridge the budgetary gap that had arisen due to slow economic growth. The government required an additional Kshs 38 billion, but compromised on a figure of Kshs 22 billion and non-essential proposed expenditure was postponed as a result. After voting on the bill brought forward by Kenyatta, Gitobu Imanyara raised discrepancy questions as to what exactly had been approved by the house. It appeared that the parliament had approved a budget of Kshs 31 billion as opposed to Kshs 22 billion that they thought they were voting on  a difference of Kshs 9.2 billion. The Deputy Prime Minister initially defended the approval but later admitted that there were computer or typographical errors in the budget bill. Amid the raging debate about the contentious issue, the Speaker ordered the CID and a parliamentary committee to question him on the discrepancies. [53] He was later cleared of any wrongdoing by the Joint Finance and Budgetary Committee. [54]

ICC charges related to 200708 post-election violence[ edit ]

On 15 December 2010, prior to him becoming president, Kenyatta was named as a suspect of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, for planning and funding violence in Naivasha and Nakuru. [55] This was in relation to the violence that followed the bungled national elections of December 2007. In furtherance of his political support for Kibaki's PNU at the time, he was accused of organising a Kikuyu politico-religious group, the Mungiki, in the post-election violence. Overall, the post-election violence of 2007 is said to have claimed about 1300 lives. Uhuru maintained his innocence and wanted his name cleared. On 8 March 2011, while serving as minister in Kibaki's government, he was indicted after being summoned to appear before the ICC pre-trial chamber. He was to appear at The Hague on 8 April 2011 alongside five other suspects. [56] On 29 September 2011, while seeking to exonerate himself, Uhuru Kenyatta put up a spirited fight as he was being cross-examined by ICC Chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo in The Hague, denying any links with the outlawed Mungiki sect. He said Prime Minister Raila Odinga should take political responsibility for the acts of violence and killings that followed the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya. He told the three judges that ""by telling his supporters election results were being rigged, fanned tensions and then failed to use his influence to quell the violence that followed the announcement of the 2007 presidential results.""

Though Uhuru had previously dismissed ICC summons, [57] he changed his decision along the way. Together with his two other co-accused suspects, Head of Civil Service, Ambassador Francis Muthaura and former Police Commissioner Hussein Ali, the trio honoured the ICC Summons that sought to determine whether their cases met the set standards for international trials. [58] On 23 January 2012, the ICC confirmed the cases against Kenyatta and Muthaura although the charges against Muthaura were subsequently dropped. [59] Serious concerns about the case have been raised, particularly the nature of the evidence being used against Kenyatta. There are also serious concerns about witness tampering and indeed, a number of witnesses have disappeared or died, [60] which is the reason cited by the ICC for dropping charges against Mathaura. [61] On a 12 October 2013 speech to the African Union in which he set a belligerent tone, Uhuru accused the ICC of being ""a toy of declining imperial powers"". [62]

On 31 October 2013, the ICC postponed Kenyatta's trial for crimes against humanity by three months until 5 February 2014 after the defense had requested more time. [63]

On 8 October 2014, Kenyatta appeared before the ICC in The Hague. He was called to appear at the ICC ""status conference"" when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld. In a speech to the Kenyan parliament Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity  not as president of the country  so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans. Kenyatta did not speak in court, but denied the charges in comments to journalists as he left the court to catch a flight back home. ""We as Kenyans, we know where we came from, we know where we are going, and nobody will tell us what to do,"" he said. The judges adjourned the hearings and charges were dropped on 13 March 2015. [64] [65] [66]

The National Alliance Party (TNA)[ edit ]

On 20 May 2012, Uhuru Kenyatta attended the elaborately assembled and much-publicized launch of The National Alliance party in a modern high-tech dome at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. His presence at the TNA launch was a strong indication that he would contest for the party's presidential nomination ticket in his quest for the presidency in the 2013 General Elections.

The Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Eugene Wamalwa and Eldoret North Constituency MP William Ruto led more than 70 MPs in attending the function. The Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly, Abdi Ramadhan, Cabinet Ministers Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Jamleck Irungu Kamau, Dr. Naomi Shaaban, Samuel Poghisio, Professor Sam Ongeri and Dr. Mohammed Kuti and MPs Charles Cheruiyot Keter, Aden Bare Duale and Mohamed Maalim Mohamud also attended the event.

Speeches at the launch revolved around the need for a thriving economy, the need for the rights of people of all classes in society to be championed, the need for peaceful co-existence, the need for visionary and committed leadership, the need for transformative leadership, the need for a youthful crop of committed professionals in leadership, the need for free and fair nomination and election processes in the General Election, the need for an economically empowered youth and a call to bring an end to divisive and sectarian interests in politics to safeguard Kenya from sliding to dictatorship. [67] Machel Waikenda was the director of communications and secretary of arts and entertainment of the National Alliance, from April 2012 to August 2013 and he led the media and communications department of the party during the 2013 elections. [68]

By-elections (17 September 2012)[ edit ]

On 17 September 2012, The National Alliance party had its first real test when it contested various civic and parliamentary positions in a by-election that covered 17 seats in total; 3 parliamentary and 14 civic. Overall, 133,054 votes were cast in the by-elections and TNA led the pack after it garnered 38.89% or 51,878 votes, followed by Orange Democratic Movement with 33.7% or 44,837 votes, Party of National Unity with 4.46% or 5,929 votes, Wiper Democratic Movement with 4.44% or 5,912 votes and United Democratic Forum with 4.15% or 5,520 votes.

TNA won civic and parliamentary seats in 7 different counties while its closest challengers, ODM won seats in 4 counties. [69] The National Alliance Party remained a strong contender for the following year's general elections, having received major defections from other big political parties of Kenya. The successful election of TNA's main candidates (Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto) continued to enhance TNA's viability.

In January 2015, however, TNA merged with URP to form the Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP).

Uhuru Kenyatta's party, The National Alliance (TNA) joined William Ruto 's United Republican Party (URP), Najib Balala's Republican Congress Party (RCP) and Charity Ngilu's National Rainbow Coalition party to form the Jubilee Alliance coalition. Various opinion polls prior to the election placed Uhuru as one of the main contenders, and his Jubilee Alliance as among the most popular. The other formidable coalition was the Coalition For Reform and Democracy (CORD), led by Raila Odinga.

In undercover video footage, released in a BBC news report on 19 March 2018, [70] the managing director of Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked to elect Donald Trump in the 2016 American presidential election, boasted that his firm had run successful presidential election campaigns in Kenya in 2013 and 2017, though he did not name Kenyatta explicitly. ""We have re-branded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging,"" Turnbull said, of the campaigns that his company managed in Kenya. ""I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thingso just about every element of this candidate."" [71] A Jubilee Party vice president admitted on 20 March 2018, that the party had hired an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica for ""branding"" in the 2017 election. [72]

Uhuru Kenyatta was officially declared the president elect on Saturday 9 March at 2:44 pm. [73] [74] [75] [76]

As per the IEBC's official results, Uhuru got 6,173,433 of the 12,221,053 valid votes cast ahead of the second placed Raila Odinga who garnered 5,340,546 (43.7%). Uhuru's result was 50.51% of the vote and was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold set out in the 2010 constitution, thus making him the president-elect. [77]

Results dispute[ edit ]

Main article: The Kenya Presidential Election Petition 2013

There was some discontent with the official results, as would be expected in such a hotly contested election, especially in Raila Odinga's strongholds. The inordinate delay [78] in releasing the results and the technical failure of some safeguards and election equipment deployed by the IEBC did not help the perception that the election had been less than free and fair. [79]

Further, an exit poll conducted by UCSD Professor Clark Gibson and James Long, Asst. Prof. and University of Washington suggested that neither Odinga nor Kenyatta had attained the 50% plus one vote threshold. [80] Analysts [ who? ] have contended that even though elections for five other levels were held in Kenya at the same time, their national turnout levels and total vote tallies were about 16% less than the presidential total; e.g. while 10.6 million voters elected candidates for member of the National Assembly, the Senate and the 47 gubernatorial seats, almost 2 million more voted in the presidential election. This has fueled concern and speculations of vote manipulation in President Kenyatta's favor. [81]

Two groups disputed these results and filed petitions challenging various aspects of it at the Supreme Court of Kenya to contest the result. The groups were the Coalition For Reform and Democracy, CORD, led by Raila Odinga, and the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AFRICOG). Uhuru Kenyatta and his running mate were respondents in these cases and were represented by Fred Ngatia and Katwa Kigen respectively. [82]

Supreme Court ruling[ edit ]

The Supreme court judges unanimously upheld the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as Kenya's fourth president after rejecting Raila Odinga's petition in a verdict delivered on Saturday 30 March 2013. Chief Justice Willy Mutunga in his ruling said the elections were indeed conducted in compliance with the Constitution and the law. [83]

Presidential swearing-in at kasarani[ edit ]

After the Supreme Court dismissed the petitions the swearing in ceremony was held on 9 April 2013 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Nairobi, in accordance to Article 141 (2) (b) of the constitution which stipulates that in case the Supreme Court upholds the victory of the president-elect, the swearing in will take place on ""the first Tuesday following the seventh day following the date on which the court renders a decision declaring the election to be valid"". [84]

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia to discuss the situation in South Sudan at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., on 5 August 2014

Presidential Standard of Uhuru Kenyatta

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2017)

During his inaugural speech, Uhuru promised economic transformation through Vision 2030, unity among all Kenyans, free maternal care and that he will serve all Kenyans. He also promised to improve the standards of education in Kenya. During the Madaraka day Celebrations, a national holiday celebrated to the country's independence on 1 June, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced free maternal care in all public health facilities, a move that was welcomed by many Kenyans. [85] [86] [87]

On 1 September 2017, the Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the re-election of Uhuru Kenyatta after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had announced him the winner on 8 August 2017. [88] As a result of that, there was a need for the election to be held once again. It was scheduled for 26 October 2017. After the reelection, Uhuru Kenyatta emerged the winner once again.

He was sworn in on 28 November 2017 for his second presidential term. [89]

Challenges[ edit ]

His major challenges include the high cost of living, rising public debt, a high public wage bill and allegations of corruption among people close to his government. [90] The 2017 general election and its violence is also a challenge that threatened not only his presidency but also the future of the East African Nation

Public Wage Bill[ edit ]

The high public wage cost has been a headache to Uhuru's administration. [91] At the start of his term, the President decried the high wage bill which was at 12% of GDP (as against a recommended 7%). [92] In 2015, the President stated that the wage bill was at 50% of the total annual revenue collection of government. [93] In an attempt to curtail it, the President announced a pay cut for himself and his Cabinet in March 2014, reducing his salary by 20%. [94] It was hoped that the high earners in government would follow suit but this did not materialize. [95] Another measure was the newly created constitutional Salaries and Remuneration Commission which it was hoped would regularize salaries but it has faced an up hill battle against Members of Parliament, who wish to protect their earnings and labor unions. [96] [97] The President thereafter ordered an audit of the government payroll so as to flush out ghost workers. [98] The audit identified 12,000 ghost workers. [99] In the meantime, lower cadre government workers have demanded pay rises, more so by teachers and health workers, who have gone on strikes at various times to demand the increase. [100] [101] The strikes in the health sector mainly affect the counties, Kenya's other level of government, as it is managed by the devolved units. [102]

Foreign relations[ edit ]

U.S. President Donald Trump with President Kenyatta in Washington, D.C., on 27 August 2018

The President's foreign relations had been dominated by the ICC question. [103] His relations with the West were expected to be cold, more so after the West warned Kenyans not to elect him as president. [104] The United Kingdom promised to have only essential contacts with him if he were elected. [105] However, his relationship with the West has thawed significantly and he has participated in the US  Africa summit [106] as well as a Somalia summit in the United Kingdom. [107] The ICC has accused his government of frustrating its investigation efforts into the case, [108] although it has absolved the President personally of any involvement in the frustration. [109]

His activities have however been more robust at the African level where he has pushed more intra-Africa trade and economic independence of African nations. [110] In November 2014, he launched consultations to reform the United Nations Security Council to expand the voice of Africa in the council. [111] He has successfully rallied the AU against the ICC culminating in an Extraordinary Summit of the African Heads of State which resolved that sitting African Heads of State should not appear before the ICC. [112] The AU further asked the Security Council to suspend his trial at the ICC; for the first time ever, the Security Council resolution was defeated by abstention with 9 members of the Council abstaining rather than voting against so as not to offend Kenyatta. [113] The Assembly of State Parties of the ICC would two days later amend the ICC statute to allow for one to appear by video link, a proposal President Kenyatta had made when he was Deputy Prime Minister. [114]

President Kenyatta has led and negotiated peace agreements in the South Sudan [115] and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. [116] At the East African level, he has developed a close relationship with the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda President Paul Kagame, creating the Coalition of the Willing, a caucus within the EAC [117] that has signed on to more joint development and economic agreements than the other EAC partners, including a joint tourist visa.

He attended the funeral of Nelson Mandela and was received warmly by the crowds. [118] He also attended the funeral of President Michael Sata of Zambia in November 2014. However, it had been perceived that his administration's relations with Botswana were strained due to Botswana's support of the ICC process. He has since visited Botswana to remove this perception and Botswana voted in favor of the AU's ICC Resolution. [119]

As expected, he has remained close to China which is funding most of his infrastructure projects. [120]

Further information: List of presidential trips made by Uhuru Kenyatta

In November 2015, it was noted that he was the most traveled Kenyan president compared to his predecessors. One of the leading national newspapers noted that Uhuru Kenyatta had been out of the country 43 times as of November 2015 [121] in a period of about three years since he took office in 2013, as compared to 33 times over a span of 10 years by his predecessor Mwai Kibaki. [122] The president's strategic communications unit [123] came out in defense of these trips stating that these trips had yielded more than what it cost the taxpayers to finance them. [124]

Approval ratings[ edit ]

His government's first year in office received low ratings from the general public. This is after a poll by Synovate indicated that more than half of the population was unhappy with how the government had conducted its affairs. The same polls also ranked the presidency as the second most trusted institution after the media. After his appearance at The Hague for his ICC case in October 2014, his poll ratings improved to 71%, according to a poll by Synovate. [125] [126] A poll by Gallup in August 2014 put his approval ratings at 78%, giving him the third best job approval ratings among African Presidents after Ian Khama of Botswana and Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta of Mali. [127] In 2015, due to allegations of corruption against some members of his government, his poll ratings dropped to his lowest rating yet at 33%, according to an Infotrack poll. [128] By February 2017, his poll numbers had, however, risen to 57%. [129] His poll numbers in 2018 would rise to 74% in light of a renewed effort to battle corruption. [130]

Drones could be used by terrorist groups as ""simple, affordable and effective airborne improvised explosive devices,"" says a report by London-based think tank the Remote Control Project.

The authors suggest manufacturers should program drones with the GPS coordinates of no-fly zones.

The British government should also relax regulations on radio frequency jammers, they add.

In addition, they advise tighter UK licensing regulation.

Currently in the UK, anyone can own and operate for non-commercial purposes a drone that weighs less than 20kg (3st 2lb) - and there are hundreds on the market.

""A range of terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate and activist threat groups have already demonstrated the ability to use civilian drones for attacks and intelligence gathering,"" the report reads.

""The best defence against the hostile use of drones is to employ a hierarchy of countermeasures encompassing regulatory countermeasures, passive countermeasures and active countermeasures.""

It suggests that these could include:

limiting the payload capacity of commercial drones
devising a security alert system when drones appear in no-fly zones
the development of ""innovative less-lethal anti-drone systems""

However, David Dunn, professor of International Politics, at Birmingham University, told the BBC that licensing may not deter terrorists.

""Law abiding citizens are likely to register, but it would be very difficult to stop terrorists and other criminals from purchasing drones abroad and then using them here,"" he said.

""Up until now it was expensive and required skill to be able to fly an aircraft - which acted as a form a regulation in itself.

""Now, you can fly these things relatively easily over people's heads.""

The report also lists recent examples of suspicious activity involving drones:

Unidentified drones have been flown over various landmarks in France, including the US Embassy and the Eiffel Tower
The Metropolitan Police recorded 20 suspicious drone-flying incidents around London between January 2013 and August 2015
So-called Islamic State has released videos showing drones being used for reconnaissance in Iraq

The authors of the report, members of a non-profit group called Open Briefing which describes itself as ""the world's first civil society intelligence agency"", admit that their suggested countermeasures are ""not foolproof"".

""The technology of remote control warfare is impossible to control,"" the report says.",nam
285,", son of the late Bob Marley, working with a partner, has acquired lands in Jamaica for coffee farming and launched Marley Coffee, marrying his father's famous name to another world-class brand, Blue Mountain.

But while the company website advertises its product as organically certified ""with the beans sourced from the highest Class One Specialty grade"", the agency that regulates the coffee trade here says the Marley operation has not yet got its stamp of approval.

Stacian Bennett, legal representative at the Coffee Industry Board, confirmed however that the application from Marley was before the board.

Jamaica's Blue Mountain coffee is a premium bean, which is said to provide a cup of exceptional balance and an exotic and intense aroma.

Marley Coffee chief executive officer Shane Whittle on Thursday said the farm was 52 acres in size, employing six to eight people full-time.

Farm location

""We have started reaping,"" he said via email.

Whittle ignored the query on the farm's actual location.

But the company website gives the Bob Marley Museum on Hope Road in Kingston as the corporate address or place of contact for Marley Coffee.

The CIB's quality assurance manager, Hervine Willis, said that if Marley Coffee were in fact selling beans, it may not be Jamaican coffee and definitely was not Blue Mountain-grown.

""The coffee is not from here,"" said Willis.

""I went to the website and they have indicated using blends from Africa. They do have a farm and they were trying to license to sell the coffee, but they have not done what they need to do, including getting their dealer's licence.""

The Blue Mountain label applies only to coffee grown in that location in the island.

The coffee board notes that licensed dealers are required to maintain a farm/production capacity of 6,000 boxes of cherry coffee per crop year.

""Anything going out of here as Blue Mountain coffee must be certified by this board. Whoever is buying Marley Coffee has no guarantee that it is Blue Mountain,"" said Willis on Thursday.

""The fact is they have not gotten any permission to market and they have not been processing Blue Mountain coffee.""

Organic products are grown without artificial inputs such as chemical-based fertilisers, with the clear intent of tapping into another premium market where natural products, especially in Europe, attract a higher price.

Bennett said that for the CIB to certify coffee products as 'organic', the farm would need to be independently reviewed by ""an appropriate and reputable organisation such as the Jamaica Organic Agri-culture Movement (JOAM).""

JOAM standards and certification committee head, Stacy Bennett, said Thursday that the organisation had not been approached to conduct such a review, but Whittle said the company was ""in the process"" of being certified by international body CERES.

Indeed, other local organic growers with whom the Financial Gleaner spoke note that they have received certification in several European countries, but none from the Coffee Industry Board.

The Blue Mountain brand

Whittle insisted that the Financial Gleaner view a video clip called 'One Cup of Coffee', saying it had full details of the farm - and had initially made it a condition of answering questions emailed to him about Marley Coffee - but the film on the company's website proved difficult to launch.

The Blue Mountain brand is also one of the most expensive to produce, at average rates of about US$7 per pound.

In 2008, Jamaica Blue Mountain and Jamaica High Mountain coffee brands, said to be the most expensive in the world, sold at base rates of US$11.50 per pound and US$7.50, respectively, and earned between US$28 million and US$50 million a year.

The 'Al' box of cherries sold for US$30 per pound and green beans for US$12 per pound.

Willis says most of the local coffee produced this year was exported green or in the raw state, with number one premium grade Blue Mountain now selling for US$33 per kilogramme. Sold as roasted coffee, the price is approximately US$44 per kilogramme. High Mountain fetches up to US$19.80 per kilogramme for raw beans and about US$25 per kilogramme for roasted.

Organic Blue Mountain attracts the highest prices local growers say, with the roasted selling this year for up to US$95 per kilogramme.

Supply of Blue Mountain coffee has fallen short in the past year or two due to the decimation of farms by past storms, and the inability of uninsured farmers to recapitalise their operations.

At the highest levels of production in the 2003/04 crop season, only 523,000 boxes of Blue Mountain and 90 boxes of High Mountain coffee were produced.",nam
286,"Arayik Harutyunyan, the separatist leader of the so-called ""Artsakh Republic,"" has been seriously injured after Azerbaijani military hit the bunker he was hiding in, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's aide Hikmet Hajiyev said in a statement after Armenia's attacks against the country's second-largest city Ganja.

""First of all, Arayik Harutyunyan, you are not at the forefront of the battle. You were hiding in a bunker. But Azerbaijani Armed Forces hit you in the bunker you were hiding in. After a missile strike, Arayik Harutyunyan has been seriously wounded,"" he said during a press conference.

""He was punished for the crimes committed against the city of Ganja and other civilian areas,"" he added.

""Other perpetrators, other war criminals will also be punished as soon as possible,"" Hajiyev said.

Harutyunyan is the so-called ""president"" of the proxy state set up by Armenia in illegally seized Azerbaijani territory. The area under separatist control is not recognized as a sovereign nation by any country on earth including Armenia, which fears such a move will stoke a fully-fledged war with Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said Sunday that one civilian has been killed and four others have been wounded in an Armenian missile attack on Ganja, as fighting intensified over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.

In statements posted on its website, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said Ganja, a city of more than 330,000 in the country's west, and several other civilian areas were under fire from rockets and shelling.

""Indiscriminate missile attacks are launched against Ganja, Füzuli, Tartar and Jabrayil cities of Azerbaijan from territory of Armenia. Ganja is the second biggest city of Azerbaijan. 500.000+ population,"" Hajiyev previously said in a tweet.

""Armenia as state and insane political-military leadership of Armenia remains source of imminent threat to regional peace, security. Azerbaijan will continue to defend its citizens,"" he added.

""Azerbaijan will destroy military targets in Armenia from which Armenia is firing on Azerbaijani cities,"" Hajiyev later said.

The new clashes erupted on Sept. 27 and international calls for a halt to hostilities have gone unanswered, with Armenia continuing its attacks on civilians and Azerbaijani forces, who are the rightful owners of the illegally occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region, as recognized by all United Nations members and the U.N. itself.

Border clashes broke out last Sunday when Armenian forces targeted Azerbaijani civilian settlements and military positions, leading to casualties. Azerbaijan's parliament declared a state of war in some of its cities and regions following Armenia's border violations and attacks in Nagorno-Karabakh.

On Monday, Azerbaijan declared partial military mobilization amid the clashes.

Relations between the two former Soviet nations have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh.

Four U.N. Security Council (UNSC) and two U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions, as well as many international organizations, have demanded the withdrawal of the occupying forces.",nam
287,"JYNWEL Capital may not ring a bell, but the name Low Teik Jho, aka Jho Low, sure does. The 32-year-old high-flying businessman needs little introduction, having shot into the limelight for his influence in oil-rich Gulf countries, parties at exclusive clubs with the likes of socialite Paris Hilton and R&B superstar Usher, and his apparent close ties with top Malaysian politicians.

But beyond his flamboyant lifestyle, the Wharton graduate is back in the news  this time for his business dealings.

Consider this  Jynwel Capital  in which Jho Low is the chief executive officer, has in the last three years been involved in deals worth more than US$7bil (RM22bil).

Based on its deal flows, the firm, which is based in Hong Kong, stands taller than many Malaysian-helmed privately-owned entities. And it has caught the attention of Malaysians and foreigners alike.

Jynwel Capital was co-founded by Jho Low and his brother Szen Low in 2010. This was a year after Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), an entity where Jho Low served as an adviser for about five months from January 2009, failed to take off.

TIA was set up to manage the oil royalty money  amounting to more than RM1bil per year  that the state was getting from Petronas. The original plan was for the state to raise RM6bil and the Federal Government to fork out RM5bil to establish a major fund to spur investments in the state and the country.

But TIA did not take off. However the Federal Government went ahead with the RM5bil fund raising that was used to establish 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

Jho Low and his brother Szen Low are the third generation of the Low family from Penang.

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report has estimated the Lows family wealth to be worth US$1.75bil (RM5.76bil).

A spokesperson for Jynwel Capital and the Low family, however, declines to verify the report, citing reasons of confidentiality and security protocols of the enlarged Low family and its beneficiaries.

Nevertheless, if the estimation by WSJ is indeed correct, then this would put the Low familys wealth on par with some of corporate Malaysias richest tycoons like Tan Sri Vincent Tan of the Berjaya Group; Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King of the Rimbunan Hijau Group, and brothers Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin and Datuk Shahriman Shamsuddin of SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, going by Forbes richest-list ranking.

These personalities have a net worth ranging from US$1.4bil to US$1.8bil, according to Forbes magazines 2014 wealth survey for Malaysia.

While Jho Low may appear to be a prime driver in the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities of Jynwel Capital, the firm has participated as a minority investor in these investments except Myla, a spokesperson tells StarBizWeek.

The Low familys investment trusts (advised by Jynwel Capital Ltd) participated as minority investors in these investments, except for Myla where the Low familys investment trusts took a majority stake.

In certain transactions such as Coastal Energy, The Park Lane Hotel and Myla, Jynwel Capital sourced the transaction, acted as an investment adviser and took the lead in managing the transaction process, the spokesperson says via email.

The spokesperson says majority stakeholders in the investments included entities with significant financial resources ranging from the global private equity firm the Blackstone Groups GSO and sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority to high-net-worth billionaire investors such as David Geffen and Dr Thomas Kaplan.

Jynwel Capital has been more visible, given its cooperation with international blue-chip private equity firms, the spokesperson adds.

Prominent deals

On Tuesday, Jynwel Capital, jointly with Spain-based oil and gas (O&G) company Compañía Española de Petróleos, SAU (Cepsa), said it was in discussions to buy London-listed Salamander Energy PLC  a deal, which if successful, will make it a significant O&G player in Asia with production in excess of 50,000 barrels.

Just in the previous week, Jynwel Capital together with unnamed Abu Dhabi-based funds launched a 1.7 billion euros (RM7.06bil) bid to buy Reebok from Adidas AG.

In November last year, Jho Low created a stir in the O&G circle when he teamed up with Cepsa to take over Canadian-listed Coastal Energy Co. Coastal Energy has principal assets in Thailand and Malaysia.

Elsewhere, Jynwel Capital had invested in global commodities company Electrum Group with Kuwait Investment Authority; and was involved in the US$2.2bil acquisition of EMI Music Publishing jointly with The Blackstone Groups GSO, Sony Corp, David Geffen and Mubadala Development Company.

The spokesperson says Jynwel Capital is positioned as an investment adviser to the Low family investment trusts and other consortium investors, besides being involved in investment and advisory services to professional investors. We do not currently manage third-party funds, the spokesperson states.

According to its website, Jynwel Capital has a focus on high-value investments in a variety of target sectors, including media and entertainment, consumer and retail, energy and resources, real estate and hospitality, precious metals, commodities and infrastructure.

Stronger foothold in O&G

Going forward, sources say that Jynwel Capital may be looking to build a stronger foothold in the lucrative O&G sector.

Sources say Coastal Energy has joined in the running to secure a production sharing contract (PSC) for Block PM9, which is a brownfield O&G development located offshore Terengganu.

The PSC for PM9 was supposed to have been awarded by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to the successful bidder by the end of 2013, according to various news reports last year. But little progress has been made so far.

The frontrunner for the project was then reported to be the joint venture comprising Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd and its Canadian partner Talisman Energy Inc.

Sources, however, tell StarBizWeek that the luck may have flipped, with Coastal Energy now seeming to be the favoured one to be awarded the PSC for PM9 by Petronas.

Coastal Energy already has an existing partnership with Petra Energy Bhd for a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang and Meranti cluster fields located offshore Peninsular Malaysia.

When asked on Coastal Energy possibly being awarded the PM9 field, the spokesperson says the Low family investor, Jho Lows father Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng, is purely a minority passive investor in Coastal Energy, and thus, is not in a position to comment. In addition, the spokesperson notes, Larry is not on the board of Coastal Energy.

For the record, a spokesperson for JynWel Capital and the Low family would like to clarify the following:

1) Jho Low's full name Low Taek Jho, and not Low Teik Jho as published.

2) While the articles on Low stated that investments by Abu Dhabi funds in 2007/08 into Iskandar Malaysia and RHB Capital Bhd did not turn out well in subsequent years as the going was slow in Iskandar while RHB Cap shares did not reach the valuations that Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) had paid, the spokesperson said ADCB went through a bid process and sold its shares for a profit. Although it received offers higher than RM10.80 per share, it ultimately sold its shares to Aabar Investments PJS due to certainty and speed of closing.

3) On Iskandar Malaysia, the spokesperson said while it faced challenges in subsequent stages (after the investment in 2007) due to weak global economic conditions, in the last few years the real estate market there had grown tremendously, and the Mudabala consortium was making a good return.

288,"The amount of financial loss from online fraud suffered by people in Western Australia has almost halved, dropping from A$16.8 million in 2014 to A$9.8 million for 2015, according to a statement this January from the states Attorney General and Minister for Commerce, Michael Mischin.

In addition, the minister noted that losses from relationship and dating fraud have fallen by 55%, to A$4.9 million lost last year.

These are both impressive claims, and at face value, there is truth to the statistics. Both assertions are based on data received by WAs Scamnet, which is the public interface between consumer protection and citizens.

While it is good to see a reduction in the number of losses overall, particularly to relationship and dating fraud, it is highly unlikely that the statistics tell the full story.

An under-reported crime

It is well known that fraud has one of the lowest reporting rates of crime types. Reasons include uncertainly in whether a crime has been committed, not knowing who to report to and the shame and embarrassment of being deceived. Generally speaking, reported fraud losses are understood as the tip of the iceberg of actual money lost and harm experienced by victims.

The ministers statement also covered Project Sunbird, a joint initiative between West Australian Police and the West Australian Department of Commerce. Project Sunbird uses financial intelligence to identify and contact people who are sending money to West African countries and notifies them of any suspicions.

The statistics for Project Sunbird show more modest reductions, with the minister reporting that the overall amount of money sent for romance and investment fraud decreased by 26% in 2015. About 72% of people who received a first letter warning of any suspicions stopped sending money immediately, and half of those who received a second letter also stopped sending money.

Again, the statistics are exciting and point to some positive results from Project Sunbird. But there are also caveats to these statistics.

I am a strong supporter of the Project Sunbird approach and have written before on its benefits. But I also believe there are factors that need to be considered in conjunction with these latest reported statistics.

Scammers on the move

Project Sunbird only looks at transactions to a small cluster of five West African countries  Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leonne and Togo. Historically, these have been hot spots for offenders.

Offenders are now asking victims to send money to other countries, including some in Asia, which are not targeted under Project Sunbird, and other similar projects.

The evaluation period for Project Sunbird is three months and only covers the five West African countries. While people may cease sending within these limits, there is currently no ability to expand the project to other countries for a longer period of time.

There has also been a shift in the ways that victims transfer money overseas. Offenders are increasingly using (often unsuspecting) money mules in Australia to move money.

In my latest research interviewing online fraud victims, a large number of victims were asked to send money via a bank transfer to an Australian account. This has changed from earlier work I did where the main focus was on remittance agencies, such as Western Union and Moneygram.

This new approach appealed to victims who were aware of the risks in sending money overseas. There was an increased sense of legitimacy in transferring the money to an Australian bank account.

But once transferred to the Australian account, the money is quickly shifted offshore to offenders. None of this is captured in the Project Sunbird figures.

Changed tactics

Offenders are also changing the methods they use to ask for money. Rather than sending cash through a remittance agency or bank transfer, there is anecdotal evidence from police that some victims have been asked to buy prepaid debit cards and forward these on.

Offenders still receive something of monetary value. However, the use of prepaid currencies avoids current forms of detection.

There are many other factors that could also be considered. For example, the existence of a few high-loss victims can increase or decrease overall dollar values figures significantly.

It is encouraging to see the current downward trend in statistics of the money lost to fraud. Project Sunbird has done a lot in terms of awareness raising and education for the community. It is also an important tool for law enforcement and consumer protection agencies in their bid to reduce victimisation.

Why do people still fall for scams?

There is a great opportunity to further evaluate the impact of Project Sunbird and its influence/crossover with Scamnet results. But I know that whatever the statistics say, there is still the question of why do so many people fall for it?

My response is simple. Its important to remember the highly skilled nature of offenders. Its critical not to underestimate their skills of persuasion and the many social engineering techniques they use to manipulate and exploit individual vulnerabilities.

Everyone has a weakness which, if targeted in the right way at the right time, may make them susceptible. We need to acknowledge that.

The current figures paint a hopeful picture that sees a decrease in the number of victims and the associated amount of losses, though I would argue it is not cause for celebration yet.

Online fraud still poses a significant problem to Australians. It would be a mistake to think that Project Sunbird has solved the issue based on the combination of these statistics.

Rather we must turn our attention to the evolution of these offences and the new ways offenders are targeting potential victims. We must look for new opportunities to ensure that Project Sunbird and other future approaches to combating online fraud are as fluid and flexible as the offenders they seek to target.",nam
289,"But something baffling arises when one compares the number published by the central government with those published by provincial authorities. By April 29, all of the 31 provincial governments had released economic statistics. Among them, in all defiance of the law of averages, no single province claimed a real GDP growth rate lower than the nationwide number. What gives?

Although apparently surprising, the contradiction between the national and provincial data is nothing more than a continuation of a long-time trend. In 2012, the real GDP growth rates released by all provincial authorities except Beijing and Shanghai exceeded 7.8 percent, the nationwide figure.

In 1985, the national statistics bureau and provincial statistic agencies were separated into two non-interfering systems. Since then, economic data from each province have been gathered and calculated by each provincial agency independently. The national bureau has been charged only with accounting for national economic data, without relying on data briefed by each province. Since 1985, a discrepancy between national and provincial data has been continuously widening. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the sum of GDP figures released by all provincial agencies outnumbered the figure from the national bureau by 2.68 trillion RMB (US$430 billion), 3.5 trillion RMB and 4.6 trillion RMB, respectively. In 2012, the gap grew to 5.73 trillion RMB, approximately 11 percent of China's national GDP.

This discrepancy is partially explained by technicalities. When collecting primary data, the central bureau and provincial agencies sometimes use different basic ""reference point"" data and statistical calibrations. Second, certain inter-provincial economic activities are claimed by all the provinces involved, leading to double counting.

Yet it is hardly possible that technical errors alone can account for such a consistent, substantial, and ever-growing discrepancy. Chinese media and citizens have inevitably speculated that economic data have been artificially modified.

Part of this skepticism traces to the incentive system for Chinese officials. Economic performance is still used as a major criterion for the evaluation and promotion of provincial bureaucrats. This leaves economic statistics particularly subject to political manipulation to serve officials' personal interest. As @ xuehanbo observes on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter, ""The reason why the data published by provincial agencies are falsely high is actually simple: the local authorities are still crazy for GDP growth, which is the key standard used to appraise officials' performance."" During a meeting in April 2012, Ma Jiantang, chief of the National Statistics Bureau, explicitly admitted that data fabrication has been the major source of statistical distortion.

In order to solve the problem, the National Statistics Bureau has proposed several initiatives to reform the bifurcated statistical reporting system. In 2004, the Bureau proposed to monitor all economic data reported by provincial agencies. In 2006 and again in 2011, the Bureau advocated for the merger of the separate systems and offered to take direct charge of provincial economic statistics reporting.

Yet none of these proposed initiatives has been turned into sustained practice. For one, the root cause of statistical corruption would not have been eliminated with reforms. Since the current system of evaluation and promotion of officials provides the primary incentive for statistical manipulation, it is in fact this system that needs to be changed. An recent editorial by the Beijing Youth Daily (@ ?????) suggests as much:

There is only one way to end the contradiction between provincial and national GDP statistics: to reform the official evaluation system and increase citizens' say in the process so that local authorities are not responsible for GDP growth alone, but also the environment, high-quality public services, and sustainable development. Only then will there be hope of freeing ourselves from the awkward GDP fights between localities and the central government.",am
290,"If there was one principal outcome from President Trumps meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on August 20, it was an alignment of expectations for the future US-Iraqi relationship. On the most important US concern, Kadhimi did not promise to eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq, and Trump did not press him on it. He did not need to.

The visit itself, and others like it, is much of how the United States competes with Iran in Iraq: through engagements, visits, and other symbolic gestures, which reinforce the current political trends of an Iraqi populace that simultaneously wants US engagement with Iran, does not want to confront militias militarily, and, above all else, does not want a US-Iran confrontation to materialize on its soil. And that is usually good enough for American national-security interests.

The Iraqi prime ministers visit was important first and foremost as a message to Iraqs public and political class. The visit should be viewed as neither an American concession to Kadhimi nor an American reward for policy steps he has taken, but rather a tool in the competition for political influence between the United States and Iran in Iraq. It is no coincidence that Iran also hosted Kadhimi for a similar high-profile visit a month ago, before he visited the United States and intended to visit Saudi Arabiain Iraqi politics, a victory for Iran.

The meeting provided a message to the same Iraqi audience about Irans influence with Iraqs new leader. Iran similarly used last Novembers visit by the Iraqi populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to send a message to Iraqis protesting its influence over Iraqs internal affairs. Sadr controlled one of the few militias with the capability to defend the protestors, and Iran wanted them to know he would not intervene to protect them, even though Tehran couldnt be sure that this was the case. The symbolism is the message with these visits, not necessarily the immediate policy results.

The second consideration to keep in mind is that the Iranian government does not own the Iraqi prime minister, and neither does the United States. I worked with Kadhimi for years while at the US State Department and always admired his pragmatism, his support for Iraqi nationalism, and his genuine pro-US sentiments, while acknowledging that he, like every single Iraqi politician, was ultimately a realist. Any Iraqi leader who becomes prime minister will represent shades of strategic gray for the United States.

As a predominantly Shia country, and one that is economically tied to Iran, Iraq is unlikely to produce a leader who will share the same perception of regional security as that of US partners such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. However, if the United States plays its cards right, the Iraqis are unlikely to choose a leader from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and their political allies.

Thats enough to both limit Iraqs threat to US partners and shape the Iraqi political environment in a manner that mitigates domestic fallout as we compete with Iran in Iraq and the region.Our policy comfort in choosing among shades of gray will impact how good we are at it. If US officials refuse a visit to the US until Kadhimi does X, Y, and Z, the chances are less likely he will do those things. Its good we didnt.

Third, Iraqis also see this visit as more of a means of affording Kadhimi personal capital and less as some gauzy message about an amorphous bilateral relationship. In Iraq, the United States must gear its policy toward individuals and not institutions, because that is how the Iraqi political game is played. The United States cannot solve the problems of the modern Arab state; when it has tried, most spectacularly in the Iraq War, it has failed. But the United States can focus on necessary short-term results, particularly those that benefit both Iraqis and Americans, rather than gearing its methods to what it thinks Iraq should look like in twenty years. Almost certainly, in the decades ahead, Iraqi politics will still very much be an individual game, with powerful political leaders looking for sponsors.

Virtually every senior politician in Iraq receives some sort of support from one or many regional powers. In a life-or-death political environment, that is necessary. The United States must play this way because it is how the game is played. The tools are visits, visas, investment, aid, and sanctions. The more these can be targeted at an individual level, to reward and punish individuals and compete within the gray zone of Iraqi politics, the better results the United States will have.

Fourth, there will always be redlines. The most pressing strategic problem for the United States are those elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), militias raised and loosely incorporated under the governments aegis, that answer to Iran. During his joint press availability with Trump, Kadhimi completely ducked questions about the militias, instead stressing US help in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the need for economic engagement. He delivered a similarly non-committal message to Iran last month.

Iraqi politicians want to adopt a see-no-evil policy toward the sharper edge of US-Iran competition in Iraq. Last summer, despite a series of explosions at PMF facilities, there was neither a binding Iraqi parliamentary vote to kick out US troops nor a political endorsement of reprisals, because civil war in Iraq is a political loser. Virtually no Iraqi wants the US-Iran competition to play out militarily in Iraq. The Iranians know it, their proxies know it, and Iraqi politicians know it. Thats a victory for the United States as it works to restrain the militias, the Iranians most potent tool.

At the joint press event with Kadhimi, Trump had it exactly right on militias: He said that when there are attacks, we deal with those attacks, but we do not burn down the house that the US and Iraq have built. Like his predecessors, Kadhimi cannot fix the seventeen-year problem of militias in Iraqi territory. The United States must be realistic about this problem, as the US has not been able to fix it either.

Indeed, in forty years of confronting Iran, the United States has never successfully solved the problem of Iranian support for militias acting as states within states. The US relationship with Kadhimi cannot depend on whether he succeeds where we have historically failed. Instead, Washington must compete in the gray zone, for partial victory, with all the tools at its disposal. This visit was a good start.",nam
291,"Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi (Urdu: ???? ??????? ?????; born 29 August 1949) is a Pakistani politician serving as the current President of Pakistan, in office since 9 September 2018. [2]

He was a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from June 2013 to May 2018 and again from August to September 2018. A founding member of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Alvi was elected as President of Pakistan on 4 September 2018 following the presidential election.

[43] He believes that the world is on the verge of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) that would change the overall outlook of the industrial working. [42]

The initiative is being run with the help of public-private partnerships with non-profit and for-profit organizations. [44]

The program has an initial target to enroll as many as 100,000 students within a year. [45]

The program has been launched in the city of Karachi where as many as 12,000 students are enrolled in the 4 disciplines being offered and registration is underway to offer it in Islamabad, and Faisalabad. The program is expected to expand to Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta in the near future. [46]

Women's Inclusion in Technology[ edit ]

One of the most important goals of the PIAIC was to provide a conduit for women to seek and find quality and affordable high tech training in most cities of Pakistan. This has resulted in creation of  Womens Inclusion in Technology , a women's empowerment division in the PIAIC. The division is led by Hira Khan, who is also the COO of Panacloud (Pvt.), Ltd. and a well-seasoned IT trainer and software engineer. She has championed women's empowerment and especially their economic empowerment in Pakistan. [47] [48]

Alvi's first-ever visit to a federal ministry as president was in June 2020 when he visited the headquarters of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs. Alvi launched the Ministry's official website on the occasion of World Ocean Day and was briefed by Maritime Minister Ali Haider Zaidi and Federal Secretary Rizwan Ahmed about the ministry's role and achievements.

292,"Former TVAM presenter Mike Morris died after NHS staff failed to spot warning signs following bladder cancer surgery, an inquest has heard.

Mr Morris, who made his name alongside Lorraine Kelly and Anne Diamond on the breakfast show, was only 66 when he died two years ago.

He had been fully expected to recover from an operation at East Surrey Hospital, to correct bleeding following bladder cancer surgery.

But an inquest in Surrey heard that a succession of failures by doctors, over many hours, led to a cardiac arrest in the early hours of the morning.

Medical witnesses told the coroner how his condition had deteriorated with no action taken to move him from a general ward to a high dependency unit.

Coroner Karen Henderson said: 'Mr Morris died from complications of necessary surgery when post operative deterioration in his condition was not recognised and consequently went un-treated.'

His death had been completely unexpected and no members of his family were present when he died in early hours of the morning at the Redhill hospital in October 2012.

Morris, who got a world exclusive interview with Nelson Mandela on his release from jail, had undergone surgery a week earlier but had developed bleeding in his urine and been re-admitted for surgery to stem significant blood loss.

He was given 5 units of blood and placed on a ward to recover.

An early warning system which monitors vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, breathing and heart rate, soon showed that Morris needed more intensive help than was available on the ward.

But a succession of nurses and doctors failed to act on the warning signs, the inquest was told.

Mr Morris went into cardiac arrest at around 6am and died at 7.10am.

Gregory Armon-Jones, who is married to Mr Morris's daughter, Helen, said the family was shocked by his diagnosis but they had taken heart from the fact his cancer was a low grade and could be easily treated.

He said: 'He had various health problems, including heart problems. He also had bladder cancer but, as far as we were concerned, this was under control.'

He said that the news of his death shocked the family.

Mr Armon-Jones, said: 'He was a larger than life character.

'You only have to watch some of the old videos of him presenting to see that. He had separated from my mother-in-law and lived on his own.

'His whole life revolved around his family, especially his two daughters Helen and Sarah, and his grandchildren.

'One of the reasons myself and Helen moved to Hersham in Surrey was to be closer to him.

Dr Des Holden, medical director at Surrey & Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The review shows aspects of Mr Morris' care after his emergency surgery were below that which he and his family were entitled to expect.

'The trust has apologised to Mr Morris' family and has introduced a range of measures to improve the post-operative care for high risk patients.

'The capacity in both the Intensive Care Unit and the High Dependency Unit have been increased to cope with demand and changes have been made to the way the ICU and outreach teams are staffed and the work patterns within the teams.'

Mr Holden said no members of staff had been disciplined as 'our investigation showed everyone involved in Mr Morris's care was trying to do their best for him.'

Famous for his distinctive moustache, Morris joined TV-am as a sports presenter, eventually becoming the host of Good Morning Britain in 1987. He remained with TV-am until 1992.

293,"Ed. note. This post is the latest in our series on the U.S. Supreme Court case Jesner. v. Arab Bank, a case that is slated to resolve the question of whether corporations can be sued under international law. Oral arguments are today.

One of the causes of action asserted in the Supreme Courts case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, is terrorist financing, an international crime also at issue in the case brought by Ukraine against Russia before the International Court of Justice (see my coverage here). As the Court hears arguments today on the case, this article provides background on the multilateral treaty prohibiting terrorist financing and calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, both criminally and civilly. It also situates this treaty within other multilateral efforts to prohibit various manifestations of terrorism.

The prohibition on terrorist financing finds expression in the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Convention), adopted by the United Nations on December 9, 1999, with Resolution A/54/109. The Convention went into effect on April 10, 2002, and has been ratified by all U.N. states with the exception of Burundi, Chad, Eritrea, Gambia, Iran, Lebanon, Somalia, and South Sudan.

The heart of the Convention is found in Article 2(1), which defines the target offense as follows:

Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:

(a) An act which constitutes an offense within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or

(b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such an act, by its 1nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act.

The prohibited act is complete once the funds are conveyed; it is not necessary to prove that the funds were actually used to carry out a terrorist offense.

The Convention broke new ground by identifying the purpose of terrorism, namely to terrorize the population. The treaty is thus premised upon the actual intention, or knowledge, that the funds will be used to carry out one of the offenses listed in an annex to the Convention. This specific intent element is important because it distinguishes the financing of terrorism from legitimate humanitarian assistance or international investment. It also distinguishes acts of terrorism from ordinary crimesa challenge for all of international criminal law.

An express goal of the treaty drafters was to oblige states to bring to justice those who provided the financial backing for terrorist acts. In addition to the direct perpetration of terrorist financing, the treaty also prohibits attempts, acts of complicity, and individuals who contribute to a group acting with a common purpose. The treaty permits states to apply a whole range of jurisdictional bases, including when the perpetrator is merely present in the state, even if the perpetrator is not a national and the offence did not occur in that state. In this way, the treatylike many other terrorism treatiesprovides for a form of qualified universal jurisdiction over offences.

The Convention also requires state signatories to enable civil liability for perpetratorsincluding legal persons. Article 5 mandates each state,

in accordance with its domestic legal principles, shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has, in that capacity, committed an offence set forth in article 2.

Such liability is incurred without prejudice to the criminal liability of individuals having committed the offences per Article 5 of the Convention.

Prior to the terror attacks of 9/11, the United Nations had adopted twelve thematic multilateral anti-terrorism conventions prohibiting different manifestations of terrorism, such as hijacking, terrorist bombing, or hostage-taking. These are the crimes incorporated by reference in the Article 2(a) definition above.

This patchwork approach reflected the fact that states could not agree on an omnibus definition of terrorism that might undergird a comprehensive convention against terrorism. A number of sticking points emerged as obstacles in this endeavor. Most importantly was the question of whether violent acts committed against privileged combatants representing a state by unprivileged combatants representing a non-state armed group constitute terrorism. Such acts are not considered war crimes by international humanitarian law (a.k.a. the law of armed conflict), so if they were to be prohibited by international law it would have to be under a different basis. This controversy first arose with respect to national liberation movements, such as the fight against apartheid (think: One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter). Today, this question arises in many of the cases before U.S. military commissions that involve acts of violence against U.S. military personnel. Another obstacle to the emergence of a comprehensive definition of terrorism is a lack of consensus about whether there is such a concept of state terrorism.

The Financing Convention actually came close to a comprehensive definition of terrorism when it prohibited the donation or collection of funds to support

[a]ny other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury  when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.

Eleven days post-9/11, the UN Security Council with UNSCR 1373 rendered the suite of terrorism treaties binding on all states, even non-signatories. In particular, this Chapter VII resolution mandated that all States shall . . . [p]revent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts. UNSCR 1373 also set up a monitoring process that obliged states to report within 90 days how they planned to comply with UNSCR 1373.

Given that the Convention is well-subscribed to and that its prohibitions now apply to all states by virtue of their UN Charter obligations, U.S. courts should have no trouble concluding that acts of terrorism also violate customary international law. I took up this question in this article, which argues that the prohibition against terrorism is now sufficiently defined and universal to satisfy the Supreme Courts test in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. This question is not before the Supreme Court in Jesner, but may arise on remand.",nam

Criminal gangs who trick people into investing in worthless shares have been targeted by police in the biggest ever international crackdown on the fraud.

The operation resulted in 110 arrests - mostly in Spain and the UK.

Police targeted the masterminds and facilitators of the ""boiler room"" fraud - so-called because of the cramped conditions they work from.

There are 850 confirmed victims of the gangs in the UK, but the real figure is likely to be in the ""multi-thousands"".

Detectives say the aim of the two-year investigation, codenamed Operation Rico, is to ""decimate"" boiler room fraud in Europe.

They believe it is the biggest ever operation against the crime.

Operation Rico, which culminated in a series of raids this week, was led by City of London Police.

Commander Steve Head, who is the national economic crime co-ordinator, said: ""It is our most important investigation ever, targeting people we believe are at the top of an organised crime network that has been facilitating boiler rooms across Europe and which is suspected of being responsible for millions of pounds of investment fraud.""

Among those under investigation were 10 ""tier one criminals"" with alleged links to organised crime and drugs, detectives said. Nine of them are British; one is South African.

The operation - supported by Spanish police - involved the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Secret Service.

""This is a landmark both from an investigative perspective and in terms of our close working partnership with other law enforcement agencies, most notably the Policía Nacional,"" said Commander Head.

Eighty-four arrests were made in Spain - where most of the boiler rooms are believed to be based - in raids involving 300 police officers, 40 of them from the UK.

Twenty people were detained in Britain, two in the US, four in Serbia.

Police released photographs of a Ferrari and a Ford Mustang seized in Marbella, and an Aston Martin recovered in Barcelona.

Detective Inspector James Clancey, from City of London Police, who was based in Spain for the operation, said: ""This is us seeking to decimate a crime type.""

Police say victims of the boiler room gangs have lost sums ranging from £2,000 to £500,000.

Those who are targeted are usually vulnerable or have a history of share investment, particularly in privatised utilities in the 1980s and 90s.

Most of them are aged 40 and over, with many in their 70s and 80s. Police say some killed themselves because of the financial problems they got into.

Fraudsters cold-call their victims, applying ""high-pressure sales techniques"" and ""confidence tricks"" to persuade them to part with their money.

They are offered returns of 10 to 20% per year, directed to authentic-looking websites and glossy brochures and asked to invest in bonds in well-known firms or in other companies that are officially registered.

Initially, they may receive ""dividends"" to give them confidence their investment is paying off but never receive any more or get their money back.

One of the victims, a woman in her late 70s, invested £23,000 in carbon credits.

She was then persuaded by another salesman to borrow money to buy £140,000 of shares in gold. She never recovered the money.

""I foolishly trusted him,"" she told BBC News, adding: ""My generation is not very streetwise - because we never had to be.""

Another victim, a 72-year-old man from the Midlands, said he and his wife had been ""scammed out of our entire life savings"".

He said that, in the weeks after realising what had happened, ""we hardly slept or ate"".

""It is still very raw to us both and we both have bad days when it is all we can think about,"" he added.

The Financial Conduct Authority has estimated that as much as £200m is lost to boiler room frauds in Britain every year.

The biggest individual loss recorded by police was £6 million.

Officers say the fraudsters spend their proceeds on Rolex watches, Armani suits, fast cars and flashy apartments.

Some are involved in drug dealing and attend drugs parties.

Avoiding detection

Each boiler room network is believed to have an accountant, money launderer and lawyer, as well as people who do the ""sales"".

These tend to be university students or travellers who speak English, including some from Scandinavia, who have answered adverts for salespeople.

They use false names and build up a ""legend"" - a cover story and false history.

""They're young people who want to earn good commission and want to drink themselves into the ground,"" said DI Clancey.

Operation Rico is the first time there has been a multi-agency and cross-border investigation against different networks of boiler room fraudsters. Previously there was more of a piecemeal approach.

However, despite some successes, criminals had become adept at avoiding detection by frequently moving offices and wiping computers.

DI Clancey said the Spanish authorities were fully behind the operation. ""The Spanish want to drive it out of Spain - it's tainting them,"" he said.

Detectives acknowledge that boiler room fraudsters will not disappear but they are more likely to operate in future in the more ""hostile"" environments of Thailand, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.",nam
295,"The conflict in Syria is far from over, and Bashar al-Assads regime now faces the difficult task of organizing its forces to win the war and ensure the peace afterward. Further consolidation of Syrian sovereignty may cause a new wave of full-scale hostilities. Even if the regime fully controls Syrian territory, there will be a long period of internal instability with the risk of another uprising and regional separatism. Therefore, the development of the army remains a high priority for the Syrian government and its allies. The current poor state of the countrys armed forces is a result of hurried, ad-hoc steps during the war for survival, but a pause in hostilities makes it possible to streamline and reform the armed forces. The main issue remains choosing whether the Syrian armed forces (SAF) will focus more on conventional operations or internal security.

Russia can be a key player in the future of Syrian forces. The Russian command has already experimented with reforming the Syrian army, forming new large-scale, quasi-regular units and integrating various irregular and rebel groups into these units. It is difficult to expect the restoration of the prewar army, which was orientated to full-scale conventional war with external opponents.

The realities of the Syrian conflict make an internal security force a more likely option for reform. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, such a restoration would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. Apart from the lack of money, the shortage of manpower has been a critical issue for several years already. The Russian experience in Syria demonstrates that the main challenges facing SAF postwar reform are unit organization and effectiveness, force structure, and the integration of former rebels.

Russian Impressions on the State of the Syrian Army

In 2015, when planning to intervene in the Syrian civil war, Russian political leaders expected a quick victory. They thought that with the support of the Russian Air Force, the Syrian army and auxiliary progovernment forces would quickly turn the tide on the ground and regain the countrys territory. The whole active operation was conceived to be only for three to four months. Therefore, initially, no plans for large-scale Syrian military modernization were made. This clearly demonstrates insufficient Russian familiarity with the situation on the ground, despite the fact that Russia supported the regime from the very beginning of the civil war.

Like other external powers involved in Syria, Russia quickly realized that air strikes alone were not enough for success on the ground. According to the first commander of Russian military forces in Syria, colonel general Alexander Dvornikov, by the summer of 2015, the Syrian armed forces had completely exhausted themselves, the personnel were demoralized, the officer corps degraded, and the armed forces showed extremely low efficiency in command and control.

Victory could only be achieved by seriously improving the SAF or by creating new friendly forces. Russia is experienced in forming small, friendly armed forces. Over the past thirty years, the Russians have participated in the creation of quasi-regular military formations in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. In recent years, with the support of Russia, two bigger military forces were formed from scratch in separatist regions of Ukraine. These are heavy formations numbering tens of thousands of fighters equipped with hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-aircraft complexes, and drones. At the same time, modern Russia has little experience interacting with irregular formations. It is not surprising that in Syria, Russia chose to work with the regular army, leaving irregulars to Iranian influence.

The Russian military and political leadership have not officially announced plans for the future development of the Syrian army, but Russia began to participate in its improvement even before it entered the war in September 2015. After the official start of the intervention, these efforts grew significantly in scale. They suggest how Russia sees the future of the Syrian army.

First Attempt at Modernization: 4th Corps

The first Russian attempt to modernize Syrian forces was the creation of the 4th Assault Corps, which began shortly before the start of the Russian Air Force operation in September 2015. This modernization was mostly administrative. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a diverse mix from the 2nd Infantry Division, the 103rd Republican Guard Brigade, the 1st Assault Brigade, the 48th, the 53rd Special Purpose Regiment, and the Marines Battalion become part of the new formation under the control of a new headquarters in Latakia. New units created from National Defence Force irregulars and conscripts from Latakia were also included. Eventually, the 4th Corps contained more than twenty separate assault groups of about one hundred soldiers each. Thus, the entire corps barely exceeded 2,000 frontline fighters and did not reach the strength of a full-fledged division.

Russia also helped with the repair of 4th Corps heavy military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers. Recruits also received quick and basic combat training from Russian military advisers. Nonetheless, there was no sizable Russian investment in this corps, particularly in small scale equipment. The main added value was supposed to be better command and control. Senior Russian officers were assigned as advisers to the corps and units headquarters, and helped manage operations and coordination with Russian air forces.

The first offensive operation of 4th Corps began on October 8, 2015, just a week after the start of the Russian intervention. Assault groups were sent to al-Ghab Plain and the mountainous region of Latakia to remove the threat to the province and the Russian air base there. Intense Russian air strikes and cruise missile attacks supported the corps offensive. The recapture of the mountainous region of the province of Latakia took six months, while Ghab Plain is yet to be controlled by Damascus.

Even though the Ghab/Latakia operation did not meet with complete success, some of the experience gained in Russia-Syria military interaction quickly spread to other parts of the country. Advisers from senior ranks of the Russian army were appointed to nearly every battalion, brigade, and division of the regular government army. The Russian military and state-hired private military contractors also worked with some quasi-regular formations, such as the elite Tiger Forces.

The Russian Ministry of Defense admits that sometimes Russian advisers played a more active role than it had planned. After the death of the commander of the 124th brigade of the Republican Guard in May 2017, the unit was effectively run by a Russian adviser for a week, until a Syrian replacement was sent. Russia thus assessed that reorganization based on existing units with minimal investments would be ineffective, and their combat value would be insufficient. Problems arose not only with the command and control structure but also with the motivation of the troops, their training, and combat effectiveness. Therefore, Russia decided to spend much more attention and resources on creating a new 5th Volunteer Assault Corps, also known in Syria as the 5th Legion.

A Model for the Future? 5th Corps

From November 2016, a much more ambitious attempt to create a new combat-ready unit of the Syrian army began. Even though the assault on East Aleppo had ended successfully by that time, it was obvious to the Russian command that the existing progovernment forces, regular and irregular alike, were still extremely ineffective.

The new 5th Corps was composed completely of volunteers, to avoid the typical conscript challenges with desertion and insufficient motivation. Fighters received 200300 U.S. dollars per month, which is quite an attractive salary in war-ravaged Syria. It is not known where the funds for the financing of the corps came from, but apparently Russia is one of the primary sources of weapons, equipment, and combat vehicles for the corps. Personnel received basic training from Russian instructors, as well as more prolonged and extensive tactical training.

Due to the lack of human resources, the 5th Corps composition became mixed. It brought together units of very different origins and motivations, mostly former irregular units outside the military command structure, such as the National Defense Forces or loyal Baath Battalions. Additional units were formed by recruiting new volunteers and demobilized veterans. Dedicated recruitment centers for the 5th Corps were created all over Syria, including in Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Tartus, Latakia, and Sweida. In 2018 former rebels from Daraa Province were also recruited into the 5th Corps.

Initially, the Russian military not only advised Syrian commanders but was in total command of the new corps at operational and tactical levels, which was necessary to break the problem of the rotten Syrian command and control structure. As Syrian personnel have gained more combat experience, the situation has shifted toward Russian advisers having less power in the 5th Corps.

An important difference from the typical Russian or Ukrainian separatist army corps was the almost complete absence of corps-level support units. In the regular army, the corps would have numerous artillery, missile, air defense brigades and regiments, and specialized support battalions, trained to fight together. The 5th Assault Corps remained organized as mostly independent infantry units, united by a joint command. Only a few select units received additional heavy weapons, but unlike for the 4th Corps these were not only outdated tanks. In addition to the old T-62M, these select 5th Corps units received upgraded T-72B3 tanks and T-90A tanks, which are purchased even today by the Russian army.

The newly created militia and irregular units, including those in the 5th Corps, are already being equipped with machine guns and pickup trucks mounted with automatic cannons. Attached artillery include multiple rocket launchers installed on the same automobile chassis. Such formations are seriously inferior in combat effectiveness to mechanized infantry, but because of their low price, they are the most affordable option for creating and re-forming future regular military units.

Despite this, challenges remain. The 5th Corps remains unstructured. While the total number of fighters in the corps is difficult to estimate, it probably exceeds 10,000 people. For Syria, the formation of such a large and relatively heavy military unit from scratch is a great achievement.The practice has shown that this corps project was more successful than with the 4th Corps. The 5th Corps was used to storm Palmyra, to establish control over the Syrian desert, to de-blockade Deir Ezzor and to capture the Euphrates valley and Daraa. In March 2019, the corps, almost in full composition, was sent to prepare for the attack on opposition-held Idlib Province.

The Russian military command highly praised the effectiveness of the 5th Corps. Especially noteworthy was the fact that the all-volunteer and relatively well-paid structure was sufficiently loyal to be used not just regionally, but all over the country. In terms of mobility, the 5th Corps has caught up with the most combat-ready Syrian units, such as the 4th Armored Division and elite Tiger Forces. Still, an important issue is whether this corps and its followers will remain relatively light in composition or later receive additional heavy military equipment and a more heavy structure? Today such a structure is compensated by the Russian air power, but self-sufficiency may require heavier native firepower.

Future Structure: Heavy or Light?

It is difficult to expect the restoration of the heavy prewar army, oriented for full-scale conventional war with external opponents. Outside threats are not a priority for Syria at this moment. Also, it would be too expensive for a war-ravaged country. There is no way for Syria to restore the previous number of tanks and armored vehicles, aircraft, and air defense systems available before the war. Their only source can be Russia. But so far no plans for large-scale procurements have been announced, and those that took place were limited. This is especially true for sophisticated modern weapons.

The only significant supply of S-300 air defense systems was a situational reaction by Russia to the loss of an IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft to the friendly fire of Syrian air defense weapons. There has been no full restoration or a serious buildup of the countrys air defense forces to a level capable of effectively protecting it from Israel and the United States. There have been no purchases and deliveries of new aircraft, either fixed or rotary wing. In the near future, Syria can expect only a small delivery of transport helicopters vital for supporting the mobility of the Syrian army.

The experience of supplying advanced tanks to Syrian forces was not very successful. The crews that lacked sufficient training used them with the same tactics as the ancient T-55 and T-72 models without much effect on the battlefield. Vital to the war effort was Russian assistance in the restoration of armored vehicles. More than 1,100 tons of spare parts for armored vehicles were transferred to Syria. Russia helped to set up the Homs tank repair/overhaul facility and smaller repair shops in Jabla and Latakia. In 20152017, they repaired 3,572 armored vehicles and another 1,244 in 2018. Such a high level of support allowed the countrys land forces to maintain some armored combat capability over the years, despite heavy losses.

Russia was also generous with the supply of heavy infantry weapons, such as 23mm ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, large-caliber machine guns, and Kornet anti-tank systems, which are also used as multipurpose support weapons. Anti-tank guided missiles played an increasing role in Syrian ground force action and gave the the SAF a necessary technical edge over rebel forces. Such infantry weapons are not only cheaper, but easier to master, and they are ideal for the tactics of small and quasi-regular units. Still, mass training and retaining high-quality officers and soldiers capable of operating sophisticated modern weapons is a challenging task for modern Syria. This is a severe limiting factor in the restoration of a heavy army.

The Problem of Integrating Former Rebels Units

The reinstatement of government control over vast swaths of territory in 2018 and numerous supposed reconciliation deals with former rebel regions have given the government an important source of personnel to rebuild Syrian regular forces. Nonetheless, there is no indication that the Syrian government has developed a unified approach to the reintegration of former rebels into national armed forces.

The regime prefers to pursue a policy of disarming surrendering rebel units, then dissolving them and recruiting individual fighters. Such an approach makes former rebels a dormant source of much-needed manpower. For many surrendering rebels, service in the army or auxiliary troops remains the only way to make a living and to avoid political persecution.

In addition to the apparent doubts about questionable loyalty of large ex-rebel contingents, their weapons and equipment are not in line with those of progovernment forces, which makes supply difficult. Fighters have mixed levels of training, and many do not have any. As a result, reconciled units, in general, do not represent a coherent and combat-worthy force useful for induction into the army and would require a complete overhaul anyway.

There are only a few examples of small rebel formations of company and battalion size that transferred to serve and fight in Syrian auxiliary units as a whole. Russia also showed flexibility in making local, temporary alliances with nongovernment forces like tribal militia units in the valley of the Euphrates River and YPG factions of Syrian Democratic Forces there. In the final stages of the defeat of the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Syria in December 2017, Russian officers and soldiers of Special Operations Forces were sent to these YPG factions as military advisers. The Russian Air Force provided close air support for the advancing Kurds. A joint headquarters was created to coordinate the actions of Russia and the militias of the Euphrates valley.

However, this was an exception to the rule, and there is no reason to expect that this approach will change concerning rebels forces in Idlib and At-Tanf. Here the government will likely prefer to disband local forces even if they manage to reach a peace agreement with them. Given the long history of armed hostility and the large number of radical Islamists in their ranks, the reliability and loyalty of such units will be always questionable.

The future of forces in the territories now under Turkish control will depend entirely on the conditions of a political settlement. But after Operation Peace Spring, it is clear that Turkey is not going to leave Syria. Of the former rebels there, Turkey formed a well-organized proxy, the Syrian National Army. It is difficult to imagine that these units, which are completely loyal and controlled by a hostile foreign state, can be somehow integrated into the Syrian armed forces, even in the long term.

The situation is different in the SDF-controlled region of the country. The Turkish operation Source of Peace in October 2019 pushed the Kurds toward reconciliation with the central government. The Syrian armed forces are now peacefully deployed on a substantial amount of SDF territories. The Syrian Ministry of Defense announced its readiness to integrate SDF troops into the regular army. The SDF General Command cautiously announced its readiness for such a step in the future, but not before a full political settlement between the Kurdish regions and the central government of the country. Such rapprochement is definitely possible, given the low level of hostility between the parties throughout the conflict.

Inevitably, the question of the fate of the SDFs well-organized and battle-hardened forces will arise. Dissolving Kurdish units and subsequently conscripting individual fighters would be ineffective. The regime must find another way to integrate them into the military, while striking a delicate balance between the autonomy of SDF units and their subordination to central command.

One method to strike this balance could be through government-run headquarters of divisions or army corps. The existing SDF brigades and battalions could be subordinated to these headquarters, which would lead on operational control and planning, personnel, supply, and logistical management and financing.

Conclusion

Russia does not plan to recreate the Syrian army in its prewar form. Modern Syria is not able to pay for this, and other allies cannot sponsor it. The ultimate goal of Russia is to create a self-sufficient SAF that will be able to maintain the unity and internal stability of the country without direct military assistance. Such a goal well coincides with the interests of the Syrian regime and will provide an exit strategy for Russia.

Russian plans to unite forces under a single command are in direct conflict with the interests of Iran, which Syria relies on for an extensive network of loyal yet irregular formations. These units are financed by Iran and are therefore more faithful to Tehran than Damascus. The final word on the composition of the regular army will still be with Russia, and it is unlikely that Russia is ready to yield to Iran in this matter. A tightly integrated vertical command structure is a critical element of Russian military strategy.

In any case, the mobile armored fist of the few elite mechanized units will remain. Its presence is necessary not only for the rapid concentration and unity of forces but also for reasons of national pride. The model tested in the 5th Corps offers a cost-effective way of organizing a mix of many different small units into larger, better-managed military structures. Unifying the chain of command is necessary to transform irregular units into regular and quasi-regular status. Such a structure would allow, if necessary, the easy integration of opposition units, including the SDF because their organization, tactics, and weapons are not very different from those of the SAF.

A serious challenge for the Syrian regime will be the need to establish its own effective command and control structure after the departure of Russian advisers. Also, it will not be easy to find financing to motivate the whole army the same way as the 5th Corps. The armament of the Syrian armed forces will consist almost exclusively of outdated equipment for the foreseeable future. From pure necessity, the government must concentrate on resources already on the ground. Significant development of the Syrian air, air defense, and naval forces is not a priority.

The Syrian army should be sufficient to suppress local uprisings and maintain the integrity of the country. At the same time, in this context the SAF would not pose a serious threat to neighbors, including Israel and Turkey. Since Russia is trying to maintain good relations with regional powers, this is a crucial deciding factor.

The main problem for the regime remains the loyalty of the renewed army. At the beginning of the conflict, entire military units changed sides. In recent years, Assad has been able to stop such cases by combining better material rewards, building patriotism among the people, and using brutal repression. If a large number of former antagonists were to be included in the army, even these means might not be enough, so maintaining the loyalty and stability of the armed forces will always remain a headache.

In the more distant future, after establishing lasting peace in the country, the structure of the army may change again. Given the nations decades of history of employing heavy mechanized military units, the SAF will inevitably gravitate to a heavier regular structure. Still, such a prospect will require significant strengthening of the economy and the political stability of the regime and is not even on the horizon.",nam
296,"A user's online actions and behaviors inside of a browser can help define who they are. That's the basis of a new patent from IBM researchers designed to help limit the risk of e-commerce fraud.

""At a high-level what we have patented is the ability to help prevent fraudulent transactions before they occur,"" IBM Master Inventor Brian O'Connell told eSecurityPlanet. ""We look at a lot of Web browser metrics that we transmit to a server on the backend and before a transaction takes place. We compare the transaction to a profile based on previous interactions from the user with the website.""

Twist on Two-factor Authentication

Based on an existing profile, it is possible to make a determination on whether or not the transaction is legitimate, O'Connell explained. The system is fundamentally a form of two-factor authentication for users, he added.

The user behavior that IBM examines involves a number of different attributes. Those attributes include how long a user typically hovers their mouse over a link before it is clicked, how a user scrolls through a page, and whether he uses the page-up/page-down keyboard buttons or just the mouse wheel.

""By measuring the attributes we are able to determine how likely a person is who they say they are,"" O'Connell said.

In a two-factor system, a user needs a second password (or factor) in order to gain access to a site or service. With IBM's invention, that second factor is the user's own browser behavior. In other forms of two-factor authentication, the user is typically aware of the factor being used, explained IBM Master Inventor Keith Walker.

""In this case, people are exhibiting behaviors as they interact with a Web page entirely subconsciously,"" Walker said.

Fraud detection systems have long leveraged anomalous behavior to help identify potential fraud. Noticing if a user is making a transaction from a different location than normal is a common fraud detection tactic today. The IBM patent is complementary to the traditional approach to fraud detection, Walker said.

More Patents on the Way

""In our patent we do reference current technology, so if a user is making a transaction and it's 3 a.m. and it's atypical for them, then that is an indication fraud might be going on,"" Walker said. ""All this technology can work together.""

Walker and O'Connell originally filed the patent for a ""user-browser interaction-based fraud detection system"" in April of 2006. U.S. Patent #8,650,080 was officially granted in February of this year, though IBM is only now officially announcing the patent. Walker noted that the time it takes for patents to be granted varies and is beyond his control. That said, he added that parts of the invention are now found inside IBM's Trusteer Pinpoint technology.

IBM has many more inventions that are patent pending to further mitigate the risks of online fraud. Walker noted that there is a patent in the system now related to fraud detection on mobile devices, for example.

""We took the concept of user behavior detection and thought through how to implement the invention in a keyboard-less touchscreen interface, where user behavior is very different than on a keyboard,"" Walker said.",nam
297,"The eldest brother of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been appointed to head a government body responsible for investigating the funding of terrorist activities, including illegal money-laundering activities.

Ahmed Saeed Hussain Khalil was appointed to the job in a decree issued on Sunday by Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, along with several other members of the board of trustees.

The Unit for Combatting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, which was founded in 2002, is authorized to access bank accounts in seeking to prevent money laundering that supports terrorism.

As a senior judge, Sisi's brother is already deputy head of the Court of Cassation, and has experience in dealing with financial issues related to trade and banking. In Sunday's decree, he was named Ahmed Saeed Hussain Khalil, the name is normally uses for professional purposes, although his full name includes the family name ""al-Sisi"".

Other members of the board named in the decree include: deputy governor of Central Bank of Egypt Gamal Abdel Aziz; head of Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority Sherif Samir Sami; deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak; and representatives of the general prosecution and the Federation of Egyptian Banks.

Sunday's announcement has been criticized by some, due to the close family relationship between the unit's new head and the president of Egypt. In addition, some have questioned the failure of the decree to make mention of the Sisi family name in announcing the appointment.

""The decree itself is not something new, but choosing [judge] Sisi to head the unit raises lots of questions,"" a source at the Court of Cassation told Al-Masry Al-Youm.

""The unit has been headed for years, since the rule of toppled president Hosni Mubarak, by Serry Siam, the former president of the Court of Cassation and former head of the Supreme Judicial Council. But nobody is aware of what it has accomplished during those years,"" said the anonymous source.

""Now, after all these years, it is to be presided over by a judge from the top judicial body in the country, who is the brother of president!""

Meanwhile, another source close to judge Sisi said that he is well qualified to head the unit, since he has experience in trade disputes, which relates to the unit's focus on banking and financial issues.

The source described judge Sisi as affirmative and strong, focused on his own professional responsiblitities, never seeking to benefit from his brother's name in the context of his work.

According to judicial sources, the Court of Cassation approved the new appointment at the request of the Cabinet. The appointment lasts for two years.",nam
298,"Tens of thousands bid farewell to the silent screen goddess at her funeral, which was dubbed the most spectacular funeral of the century by The New York Times. Film historian Mark Cousins wrote in Prospect that the procession through Shanghai was three miles (4.8 km) long, and during the march three other women committed suicide, so overcome were they by their grief for Ruan. The funeral was far beyond even that for Rudolph Valentino, the Hollywood silent film star whose death in 1926 only heightened his romantic appeal.

But in 2001, two other versions of Ruans suicide note surfaced. In one of the notes, the late actress blamed the womaniser tycoon Tang for mistreating her and breaking her heart, while accusing Zhang of his malicious act in shaming her publicly. There was great public speculation about which of these notes most got to the heart of why she did it  in part because of the phenomenal success of Centre Stage and Maggie Cheungs portrayal of Ruan. Cheung won the best actress prize at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1992 for her performance in Centre Stage, which the US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum named as the best film of the 1990s.

A couple of years later, in 1994, a stage drama about Ruans life was performed in Beijing  it was revived for another run in 2013. And the actress Jacklyn Wu Chien-lien would go on to portray Ruan in a Chinese TV series about her life that spanned 30 episodes.

The true cause for Ruans suicide remains a mystery. But regardless of the reasons for her untimely death, Ruan accomplished a great deal in her short life as the brightest star of early Chinese cinema. And with her education, modern style and portrayal of independent women onscreen  even if those women could sometimes be subject to abuse by men, as she was herself  she became an icon of Chinas republican era, sealing her status as an immortal goddess in the hearts of modern day film buffs.",nam
299,"On 21 November 2016 the FCA issued a booklet aimed at consumer credit firms setting out good and bad practice on compliance with obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLR). While directed at consumer credit firms, the booklet is, of course, relevant to all firms subject to the MLR.

AML Focus

Financial crime is one of seven regulatory priorities for the FCA according to its 2016/17 Business Plan. It also remains an area of enforcement focus with the FCA. Most recently, on 12 October 2016, the FCA fined Sonali Bank £3.25m for a series of money laundering systems and controls failings. The Banks MLRO was also fined and prohibited from holding the MLRO function and from performing any MLRO or compliance oversight function.

Risks

The risks posed to consumer credit firms differ from risks for other financial services firms. According to the JMLSG, in the consumer finance context the main money laundering risk arises from an acceleration in the repayment schedule whereby the borrower may seek to use tainted funds to repay borrowings and launder money in that way. Lenders also have to deal with fraud and identity theft issues which can also feed into money laundering concerns.

The Checklist

We set out below the key messages from the FCA together with recommendations on action that firms should take.

Risk Assessment Carry out a risk assessment proportionate to the nature and scale of your activities. The carrying out of risk assessments should be a continuous process. The suggestion in the FCA booklet is that too often these are regarded as one-off or annual exercises. However, firms need to conduct a regular review of risks.

Adequate resources should be focussed on areas of risk identified.

Policies and procedures Effective, up to date and accessible policies and procedures should be prepared. Polices and procedures should be reviewed and kept up to date. The practical application of policies and procedures should be reviewed/audited regularly to ensure that they are appropriately applied and implemented. This should also highlight whether changes should be made to existing policies and procedures.
Governance Senior management must be fully engaged in oversight of financial crime matters and must be aware of the financial crime risks to which the firm is subject. They should also set the right tone from the top. Firms should ensure that senior management responsibility for financial crime risks is appropriately documented. This assists in demonstrating clarity around the allocation of responsibilities and assists in evidencing compliance.

Tone from the top can be a cliché. However, active hands on involvement by senior managers in dealing with financial crime issues will show that the issue is taken seriously across the organisation.

Senior management should receive management information on financial crime risks, including the output of risk assessments. Senior management involvement in financial crime issues should be documented, for example, through board minutes or minutes of other compliance committees or forums.

Staff Awareness Relevant financial crime training must be provided to staff in key roles. Monitoring and HR processes should ensure that staff compliance with financial crime requirements and processes is reviewed and any deficiencies addressed. The FCA cite as an example of good practice the monitoring of employees work to ensure that they have an understanding of risks relating to the firm.
Data Security Firms must have written data security policies and appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure customer data is kept safe. Data security must not be treated as exclusively an IT or privacy issue, but financial crime risks must also be taken into account. Access to data should be limited to those who require access in order to perform their roles. From a governance perspective responsibility for data security should be allocated clearly. Beware when outsourcing that appropriate controls are put in place.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Where firms are subject to the Money Laundering Regulations they must establish and maintain systems and controls to reduce the risk that the may be used to handle the proceeds of crime. AML procedures should be risk based so that the same customer due diligence (CDD) procedures should not be applied across all customers and products.
Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Where there is a higher risk of money laundering, from certain clients such as PEPs or higher risk jurisdictions, firms must undertake EDD. Senior managers should be involved in approving higher risk customers and be aware of what additional checks are required.
Ongoing monitoring / Suspicious Activity Reporting Firms must conduct on-going monitoring of their business relationships on a risk-sensitive basis. Firms should draw on the information they have about their customers and their activities with a view to detecting unusual or suspicious behaviour.
Record-keeping The FCA requires retention of customer identity records for five years after the business relationship. Make sure that your firms policies and procedures reflect this requirement. Practically, it is also important that this information can be retrieved quickly and easily for compliance staff and also should the regulator ask to see it. Where reliance is placed on third parties make sure that they have adequate procedures as your business remains responsible.

Of all the above issues, there are two in respect of which firms should place special emphasis.

Governance

Governance: the accountability of senior managers to guard against financial crime is provided for under high level standards in the FCA Handbook in respect of systems and controls. In this regard, a firm must allocate to a director or senior manager (e.g. the money laundering reporting officer) overall responsibility. It is vital that proper reporting lines are in place and that information can reach management and relevant committees in a timely fashion for consideration and action, where necessary. With the roll out of the Senior Managers and Certified Persons Regime to all financial services firms in 2018, the incentive on managers to ensure that reasonable steps have been taken will be further increased.

Data Security

There is also the threat posed by cyber attacks and the corresponding need to ensure data security. The growing use of technology in delivering services to clients, the sheer amount of data and its nature makes cyber security a key issue. The Data Protection Act 1998 requires that information must be kept securely and protected against criminals who would, for instance, commit identity theft. Good data security policies and appropriate systems and controls are a necessity in ensuring that staff understand their responsibilities and in demonstrating compliance to regulators, including the Information Commissions office with their growing penalty powers.",nam
300,"Rahul Pangam worked at Google for seven years focusing on reducing fraud, and now he's taken that expertise to his startup Simility. Pangam founded Simility with the goal of reducing online fraud via a combination of human data scientists and the right amount of machine learning.

Pangam, who is also CEO of Simility, started building the company in May 2014 with a number of fellow former Google engineers. The effort has culminated in the Simility platform, which became generally available on May 26.

To date, Simility has raised $7.2 million in venture funding from a number investors, including Accel and Trinity Ventures.

""At Google, we were instrumental in building and scaling up a lot of the abuse and fraud detection efforts across various products,"" Pangam told eWEEK. ""At Google, we had the resources to build very sophisticated platforms, but what we realized is that the larger market had a real need for a better fraud prevention system.""

The core technologies behind Simility are a mix of open-source and purpose-built proprietary code. Pangam explained that Simility makes use of the open-source Cassandra NoSQL database to help make decisions in real time on potential instances of fraud.

""We use open-source technology as much as we can and then on top build our proprietary machine learning models,"" Pangam said. ""We focus on where we can make a big difference.""

The key innovation for Simility, though, isn't its core technology but rather how it can be customized to fit specific use cases. For example, Pangam said that in an online travel business, understanding where a flight ticket is purchased and where a user is going has an impact on determining fraud. But for a gaming company, the metrics for understanding fraud are somewhat different, as it's important to understand how a user buys an in-game credit and how soon thereafter that credit used.

""Specific attributes can make a huge difference to differentiate between fraud and regular user behavior,"" he said. ""We try to customize the model for specific customers.""

The challenge of customization is that it can often require professional services. Simility tries to minimize the need for professional services with a step-by-step process that drives an automated technique to enable customization, Pangam said. From a deployment perspective, organizations tie into the Simility platform by way of a line of JavaScript or an integrated API. Simility makes use of cloud data centers around the world for its back-end infrastructure.

The market for fraud detection technologies is a competitive one, including such vendors as Experian and Equifax. Key differentiators for Simility, according to Pangam, are its customization capabilities and its use of hands-on data scientists to help customers. Customers get weekly consultations with a data scientist to help continuously adjust and improve the model in an effort to reduce fraud.

""We have built a hybrid approach that lets customers have a degree of policy control and not be entirely at the mercy of machine learning models,"" he said.",nam
301,"A New Zealand physiology professor says transgender athletes have advantages over their female competitors and more research needs to be done by sporting regulators before they should compete against each other.

Otago University professor in physiology Alison Heather has researched transgender changes, particularly in top level sport.

She is adamant international sporting regulation bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have rushed a decision to include transgender athletes in male and female categories, as there has not been enough research.

Heather says the controversial inclusion of Kiwi weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is a good example of the IOC not taking the time to research the science behind a transition.

""It could be seen as an advantage and that is why they have male categories and female categories.""

Heather believes there is a potential muscle memory effect for Hubbard, having competed previously as a man.

She said the increased numbers of myonuclei (muscle fibres) could potentially allow Hubbard's muscles to train better than if she had not previously been a male.

""Also, whether hormone therapy has reduced the larger skeletal muscle fibre area of her previous male physique is questionable.""

In 2015, the IOC changed their regulations to include trans women in the women's category of events if they remained under the testosterone levels of 10 nanomoles per litre (NMOL/L) a year prior to competing, as well as during competition.

However, a CIS female (a born female) can reach nowhere near the testosterone level of 10 NMOL/L. The average female sits at 2.8 NMOL/L and the average male 23-25 NMOL/L. This means the likes of Hubbard competes at three times the amount of testosterone to other weightlifting females.

""It hasn't been studied, but logical science will tell you someone who has three times more testosterone has the advantage physically. We need to do more research before arguing either way.

""I don't know what the solution is, but right now it is not fair on CIS females competing against transgender women.""

Heather said not only can testosterone levels give trans women an advantage over their CIS female competitors, after transitioning a trans woman's muscle mass, lung capacity and muscle memory all remain the same as when they were CIS male. That could give the trans female athlete a possible advantage when competing in activities that involve physical strength.

""The physiological attributes of males that makes them naturally stronger including anatomical and biological features such as size, muscle mass, lung capacity, and heart size would be an advantage.""

Heather said higher testosterone levels could give an athlete an advantage for power and speed sports.

""Higher testosterone levels could potentially have performance enhancing effects.""

The IOC settled on a maximum level of 10 NMOL/L for trans female athletes - a level Heather deemed as set ""without adequate research"".
""There has been very little research into elite male to female transgender athletes.

""Whether this normalising of hormone levels (and at 10 NMOL/L it is debatable whether they are normalised enough) removes the vast majority of the advantage of having been male is still an unanswered question.""

Heather said there has been only one study of eight non-elite recreational runners who had transitioned from male to female, and their performance times were very similar. She said it was unfair to base restrictions and regulations on one study.

As current regulations sit with the IOC, there is also no restriction around the level of haemoglobin (increased haemoglobin increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood). Scientifically testosterone positively influences haemoglobin levels.

""Given the lack of research, there is a real need to study what physical advantages transgender females carry after hormone therapy with consideration required for different sports, trainability and for performance.

""Until then, it is very difficult to conclude that it is a level playing field for CIS women versus trans women.""

The IOC based the 10NMOL regulation on the lower level of a CIS male of 10 NMOL/L - the upper range for a female is 3.1 NMOL/L.

At highest level, a CIS female with polycystic ovary syndrome can have up to two times or more higher levels of testosterone, meaning around 6 NMOL/L.

Disorders of sexual development (DSD) women have testosterone levels in the lower male range of around 10 NMOL/L, and this is another controversial point when competing at an international level of sport, says Heather.

In 2015, Indian athlete Dutee Chand challenged the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) in the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS).

The CAS ruled there was evidence that high testosterone levels do increase lean body mass, creating a competitive advantage and the IAAF must produce sufficient evidence about the relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance.

They suspended the 10 NMOLl/L ruling, and DSD women were allowed to compete without hormone therapy to lower testosterone levels.

Earlier this year, British Journal of Sports Medicine scientists Stephane Bermon and Pierre-Yves Garnier found there was statistically significant differences in the performance of higher testosterone female athletes versus lower testosterone athletes at the 2011 and 2013 International Athletics Federation World Championships across five separate events.

However there has been no change on the suspension of the 10 NMOL/L threshold for DSD athletes - but in the meantime, the new regulations for transgender women were set. Meaning trans gender athletes and DSD athletes are at odds also.

AT A GLANCE:
Transgender athletes
- Presently, they are allowed to compete with 3X higher testosterone levels than the high range CIS female.
- Although there is no scientific evidence to support that this provides them with an advantage, it is known that testosterone (androgens) provide an advantage to females.
- Increased endogenous androgens increase explosive performance.
- Exogenous androgens can be used to enhance performance  increased power, strength and training capacity.",nam
302,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces killed at least one anti-government protester using live gunfire and wounded at least 40 others in the southern city of Basra on Friday, security sources and a rights official said.

It was the first killing of a protester by security forces in Basra since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office in May.

Iraqs interior ministry confirmed the death but said in a statement that no Iraqi security forces were being allowed to use weapons against demonstrators and that it was investigating the incident.

Deadly flare-ups have been rare since protests against Iraqs ruling elite and demanding jobs and services largely subsided earlier this year.

During months of anti-government protests that erupted under his predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi in October 2019, more than 500 people were killed, mostly young unarmed demonstrators.

The Basra security sources and rights official said several dozen protesters had taken to the streets in the countrys southern oil hub on Friday demanding jobs and basic services.

They were angry that Kadhimi had generally failed to deliver on both and that protest camps had been cleared by security force in Basra and Baghdad, the rights official said.

Kadhimi, who visited Basra on Thursday to tour energy projects and meet provincial officials, has pledged to protect non-violent Iraqi protesters and bring justice for the families of those killed last year by security forces and unidentified gunmen.

Security forces in Baghdad last month were ordered not to use live fire in dealing with protests to mark the anniversary of the 2019 demonstrations.",nam

Mattarella was previously Minister for Parliamentary Relations from 1987 to 1989, Minister of Public Education from 1989 to 1990, Deputy Prime Minister of Italy from 1998 to 1999 and Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2001. In 2011, he became an elected judge on the Constitutional Court. On 31 January 2015, he was elected by the Italian Parliament to serve as President of the Italian Republic.

Early life[ edit ]

Sergio Mattarella with his father Bernardo, in 1963

Sergio Mattarella was born in Palermo, in a prominent Sicilian family. His father, Bernardo Mattarella, was an anti-fascist who, alongside Alcide De Gasperi and other prominent Catholic politicians, founded the Christian Democracy (DC), which dominated the Italian political scene for almost fifty years, with Bernardo serving as a minister several times; [1] while his mother, Maria Buccellato, came from an higher middle class family of Trapani. [2] [3]

During his youth, Mattarella moved to Rome, due to his father's commitments to politics. In Rome, he became a member of Catholic Action (AC), a large Catholic lay association, of which he became the regional chairman for Lazio from 1961 to 1964. [4]

After attending the classical lyceum San Leone Magno in Rome, [5] he studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he joined the Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI). [6] In 1964 he graduated with merit with the thesis The function of political direction. [7]

In 1967, he became a lawyer in Palermo, becoming particularly involved in administrative law. [8] After a few years, Mattarella started teaching parliamentary procedure at the University of Palermo, where he remained until 1983. His academic activity and publications had mainly concerned constitutional law topics, the intervention of the Sicilian Region in economy, bicameralism, legislative procedure, expropriation allowance, evolution of the Sicilian regional administration and controls on local authorities. [9]

In 1966, he married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, former rector of the University of Palermo, with whom he had three children: Laura, Francesco and Bernardo. [10]

Mattarella's parliamentary career began in 1983, when he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies in a left-leaning faction of the DC that had supported an agreement with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) led by Enrico Berlinguer, the so-called Historic Compromise. The following year he was entrusted by the Secretary of the Christian Democrat, Ciriaco De Mita, to ""clean up"" the Sicilian faction of the party from Mafia control, at a time when men of honour of Cosa Nostra like Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino were powerful political figures. [13] In 1985 Mattarella helped the young lawyer Leoluca Orlando, who had worked alongside his brother Piersanti during his governorship of Sicily, to become the new Mayor of Palermo.

Mattarella was appointed Minister for Parliamentary Affairs in the governments led by Christian Democratic Prime Ministers Giovanni Goria and Ciriaco De Mita, and in 1989 he became Minister of Public Education in the sixth cabinet of Giulio Andreotti. Mattarella stood down from his position, together with other ministers, in 1990 upon parliament's passing of the Mammì Act, liberalising the media sector in Italy, which they saw as a favour to the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. [14]

Sergio Mattarella in 1994

In 1990 Mattarella was appointed Vice-Secretary of Christian Democracy. He left the post two years later to become director of Il Popolo, the official newspaper of the party. Following the Italian referendum of 1993 he drafted the new electoral law nicknamed Mattarellum. [15] In 1994, when Christian Democracy was dissolved in the wake of the Tangentopoli corruption scandal, he helped found the Italian People's Party (PPI), along with its first leader Mino Martinazzoli and other former Christian Democrats. [14] In the ensuing 1994 general election (in which the newly founded PPI fared poorly) Martinazzoli was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies. [16] He soon found himself engaged in an internal dispute after the election of a new party leader, Rocco Buttiglione, who wished to steer the Italian People's Party towards an electoral alliance with Berlusconi's Forza Italia. [14] Following Buttiglione's appointment, Mattarella resigned as director of Il Popolo in opposition to this policy. [17]

Mattarella was one of the first supporters of the economist Romano Prodi at the head of the centre-left coalition known as The Olive Tree (L'Ulivo) in the 1996 general election. After the electoral victory of the centre-left, Mattarella served as President of the PPI's parliamentary group. Two years later, when Prodi's first government fell, Mattarella was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the government of Massimo D'Alema, then-leader of the Democrats of the Left (DS). As Minister of Defence, he supported the NATO Intervention in Yugoslavia against the Serbian President Slobodan Miloevi?; he also approved a reform of the Italian Armed Forces which abolished conscription. After the resignation of D'Alema in 2000, Mattarella kept his position as Minister of Defence in the government of Giuliano Amato. [14]

2000s[ edit ]

In October 2000 the PPI joined with other centrist parties to form an alliance called The Daisy (DL), later to merge into a single party in March 2002. Mattarella was re-elected to the Italian Parliament in the 2001 and 2006 general elections, standing as a candidate for The Daisy in two successive centre-left coalitions  The Olive Tree and The Union (L'Unione). [16]

In 2007 he was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD), a big tent centre-left party formed from a merger of left-wing and centrist parties which had been part of The Olive Tree, including The Daisy and the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the Italian Communist Party). [14]

On 5 October 2011 he was elected by the Italian Parliament with 572 votes to be a judge of the Constitutional Court. He was sworn in on 11 October 2011. He served until he was sworn in as President of the Italian Republic. [18] [16]

Main article: 2015 Italian presidential election

Sergio Mattarella with his predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano

On 31 January 2015 Mattarella was elected President of the Italian Republic at the fourth ballot with 665 votes out of 1,009, with support from the Democratic Party (PD), New Centre-Right (NCD), Civic Choice (SC), Union of the Centre (UDC) and Left Ecology Freedom (SEL). [19] [20]

Mattarella was officially endorsed by the Democratic Party after his name was put forward by the Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. [21] Mattarella replaced Giorgio Napolitano, who had served for nine years, the longest presidency in the history of the Italian Republic. However, since Napolitano had resigned on 14 January, Senate President Pietro Grasso was the Acting President at the time of Mattarella's inauguration on 3 February. Mattarella's first statement as new President was: ""My thoughts go first and especially to the difficulties and hopes of our fellow citizens"". [22] [23] [24]

His first presidential visit was on the day of his election, when he visited the Fosse Ardeatine where, in 1944 during World War II, the Nazi occupation troops killed 335 people as a reprisal for a partisan attack. Mattarella stated that ""Europe and the world must be united to defeat whoever wants to drag us into a new age of terror"". [25]

On 6 May 2015 Mattarella signed the new Italian electoral law, known as Italicum, which provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.

Mattarella and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, April 2017

On Sunday 4 December 2016, a constitutional referendum was held in Italy. [26] Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, [27] as well as the division of powers between the State, the regions, and administrative entities.

The bill, put forward by then- Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber), and, eventually, its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 (Senate) and 12 April 2016 (Chamber). [28]

In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution, a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one-fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, [29] since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote. [30] 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect. [31] This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic; the other two were in 2001 (in which the amending law was approved) and in 2006 (in which it was rejected).

The constitutional reform was rejected with almost 60% of votes, and on 7 December 2016, Prime Minister Renzi announced his resignation. On 11 December Mattarella appointed the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs Paolo Gentiloni as new head of the government. [32] [33]

2018 general election[ edit ]

Main articles: 2018 Italian general election and 2018 Italian government formation

The March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The election was seen as a backlash against the establishment with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League becoming the two largest parties in the Parliament. [34] [35]

After the election's results were known, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the M5S, and Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League, each urged that Mattarella should give him the task of forming a new cabinet because he led the largest party or coalition, respectively. [36] On 5 March, Matteo Renzi announced that the PD would be in the opposition during this legislature and that he would resign as party leader when a new cabinet was formed. [37] On 6 March, Salvini repeated his campaign message that his party would refuse any coalition with the Five Star Movement. [38] On 14 March, Salvini nonetheless offered to govern with the M5S, imposing the condition that League ally Forza Italia, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, must also take part in any coalition. Di Maio rejected this proposal on the grounds that Salvini was ""choosing restoration instead of revolution"" because ""Berlusconi represents the past"". [39] Moreover, a Five Star leader, Alessandro Di Battista, denied any possibility of an alliance with Forza Italia, describing Berlusconi as the ""pure evil of our country"". [40]

The consultations between Mattarella and the political parties on 4 and 5 April failed to result in a candidate for Prime Minister, forcing Mattarella to hold another round of consultation between 11 and 12 April 2018. [41]

On 18 April 2018 Mattarella tasked the President of the Senate, Elisabetta Casellati, with trying to reconcile the issues between the centre-right and the Five Star Movement, in order to break the post-election political deadlock and form a fully functional new government. [42] [43] However she failed to find a solution to the conflicts between the two groups, especially between the M5S and Forza Italia. [44] [45] On 23 April 2018, after Casellati's failure, Mattarella gave an exploratory mandate to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Roberto Fico, to try to create a political agreement between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party. [46] [47] [48] However, on 30 April, following an interview of the PD's former leader Matteo Renzi in which he expressed his strong opposition to an alliance with the M5S, Di Maio called for new elections. [49] [50] [51]

On 7 May, Mattarella held a third round of government formation talks, after which he formally confirmed the lack of any possible majority (M5S rejecting an alliance with the whole centre-right coalition, PD rejecting an alliance with both M5S and the centre-right coalition, and the League's Matteo Salvini refusing to form a government with M5S unless it included Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, whose presence in the government was explicitly vetoed by M5S's leader Luigi Di Maio); as a result, he announced his intention to soon appoint a ""neutral government"" (ignoring M5S and the League's refusal to support such an option) to take over from the Gentiloni Cabinet which was considered unable to lead Italy into a second consecutive election as it represented a majority from a past legislature and suggested an early election in July (which would be the very first summer general election in Italy) as an option in light of the ongoing deadlock. [52] The Lega and M5S agreed to hold new elections on 8 July, an option that was however rejected by all other parties. [53] [54] [55]

On 9 May, after a day of rumours, M5S and the League officially asked Mattarella to give them 24 more hours to strike a coalition agreement between the two parties. [56] Later the same day, in the evening, Silvio Berlusconi publicly announced that Forza Italia would not support an M5S-League government on a vote of confidence, but would nevertheless maintain the centre-right alliance, thus opening the door to a possible majority government between the two parties. [57] On 13 May, the Five Star Movement and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, likely clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but they could not agree regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the prime minister. M5S and League leaders met with Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government. [58] At their meeting with Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program, as well as a prime minister to lead the joint government. Both M5S and the League announced their intention to ask their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend.

On 21 May 2018, a private law professor, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister in the 2018 Italian government. [59] [60] [61] Despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government, [62] Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace on 23 May 2018 to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet. [63] [64] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the ""defense lawyer of Italian people"". [65]

However, on 27 May, Conte renounced his mandate, due to conflicts between Salvini and Mattarella. Salvini had proposed university professor Paolo Savona as Finance Minister, but Mattarella strongly opposed the appointment, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German. [66] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the Eurozone and that, as the guarantor of the Italian Constitution and the country's interest and stability, he could not allow this. Mattarella subsequently gave economist Carlo Cottarelli the presidential mandate to form a new government [67] [68] [69]

Mattarella's decision prompted furious reactions from the Five Star Movement, who called for Mattarella's impeachment, a move also supported by opposition party Brothers of Italy. [70] The League did not support this action. [71]

Calls for impeachment were strongly criticized by Italian and international press: Luciano Fontana (editor of Corriere della Sera) defended Mattarella and said that ""Di Maio and Salvini are responsible of this crisis"", Mario Calabresi (editor of la Repubblica) dismissed impeachment proposals as ""delirious"" while La Stampa called Di Maio and Meloni's proposal ""extremely irresponsible"". [72] HuffPost editor Lucia Annunziata dismissed Di Maio and Salvini as ""liars"", newsmagazine L'Espresso called them ""subversive"", while Le Monde praised Mattarella as an ""intransigent guardian of the Constitution"". The president was also defended by The Guardian, Libération and Der Spiegel; German business newspaper Handelsblatt even titled ""Forza Mattarella!"" (""Go Mattarella!"") [73] [74] [75] [76] Marco Travaglio and Maurizio Belpietro (editors of Il Fatto Quotidiano and La Verità) criticized Mattarella's move as an abuse, but recognized that it was not sufficient to start an impeachment procedure. [77] [78]

On 31 May Giuseppe Conte received again the presidential mandate to form the new cabinet. [79] The new government was sworn in on 1 June.

2019 political crisis[ edit ]

President Mattarella during the August 2019 consultations.

In August 2019, deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini announced a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority. [80] Many political analysts believe the no-confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in Parliament, ensuring that Salvini would become the next prime minister. [81] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte harshly accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who ""had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest"", [82] the prime minister resigned his post to President Mattarella. [83] On the following day, Mattarella started the consultations with parliamentary groups. [84]

During the round of the so-called consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party. [85] On 28 August, PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti announced at the Quirinal Palace his favorable position on keeping Giuseppe Conte at the head of the new government, [86] and on following day, Mattarella received Conte to give him the task of forming a new cabinet. [87] On 4 September, Conte announced the composition of his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day. [88] On 9 September 2019, the Chamber of Deputies granted the confidence to the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against and 3 abstentions. [89] [90] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of the new government and 133 voted against. [91]

Coronavirus pandemic[ edit ]

Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy

During Mattarella's presidency, Italy was hit by a major outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, Italy became one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. [92] As of September 2020, more than 300,000 coronavirus cases and 35,000 deaths were confirmed, affecting mainly the regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont. [93]

On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country. [94] On 8 March 2020, the Italian government extended the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under lockdown. [95] On the following day, the government extended the quarantine measures previously applied only in the so-called ""red zones"" to the whole country, putting de facto 60 million people in lockdown. [96] [97] At the time of its application, this measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history. [98] [99] [100] [101] On 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms. [102] The possibility to travel between different regions was restored on 3 June. [103]

He was married to Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, a professor of Roman law and rector of the University of Palermo. His wife died in 2012. He has three children: [104] Bernardo Giorgio (born 1968), [105] Laura (1968) and Francesco (1973).

His brother, Piersanti Mattarella, was murdered in 1980 in Sicily by Cosa Nostra while serving as President of the Regional Government of Sicily. Another brother, Antonio Mattarella, has been appointed Managing Director of the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs from 2005 to 2017. [106] [107]

His daughter, Laura, acted as de facto First Lady, accompanying her father in the official trips outside Italy.

305,"Harald V king of Norway from 1991, succeeding his father, Olav V.

Harald was the youngest of three children born to Olav and Crown Princess Märtha. However, as the only son he became crown prince when his father assumed the throne in 1957. Harald attended the Norwegian Military Academy and Balliol College, Oxford, and attained the rank of captain in three branches of his countrys armed forces. Like his father he was a fine athlete and excelled at yachting.

Haralds courtship of a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, caused some controversy, and he reportedly threatened to never wed if the couple were prevented from marrying. Olav eventually gave his consent, and, after some nine years of dating, the pair were married on August 29, 1968. Harald and Sonja had two children, Märtha Louise (born 1971) and Haakon Magnus (born 1973).

Harald became king of Norway upon the death of his father on January 17, 1991. Although the succession law had been changed in 1990with the eldest child, whether male or female, assuming the throneit applied only to those born subsequently, and thus Haakon became crown prince. Like the duties of other Scandinavian monarchs, Haralds were largely ceremonial.",nam

German police are investigating a ""probable terrorist attack"" after a man ploughed a lorry into a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.

The driver, a Pakistani asylum seeker who entered Germany last year, is being questioned.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be ""particularly sickening"" if he were proven to be a refugee.

He was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terror links.

German media say police have searched a refugee shelter at a defunct Berlin airport where the suspect was believed to be staying.

Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man was probably from Pakistan, and that his application for asylum had not yet been processed.

The suspect denies involvement, Mr de Maiziere said.

Live: Latest updates

Berlin attack: What we know

""We have to assume this was a terrorist attack"", Mrs Merkel said in a short statement on Tuesday.

Those behind the attack would be punished ""as harshly as the law allows"", she added.

What happened?

The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in Berlin's west.

The attack happened in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which was damaged in a World War Two bombing raid and preserved as a symbol of peace.

The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), one of its busiest times. It crashed through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.

The DPA news agency said police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area.

What do we know about the suspect?

German media have identified the suspect, citing security sources, as a 23-year-old Pakistani named Naved B who entered the country in either late 2015 or early 2016.

Reports said special forces had stormed a hangar at Berlin's Tempelhof airport where they believed the suspect had been living in a shelter before the attack.

Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said he was seized after leaving the lorry and fleeing on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.

A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.

Where did the lorry come from?

Police said a Polish man, believed to be the original driver, had been found dead on the passenger seat.

Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.

""We don't know what happened to him,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him.""

The truck was registered in Poland, but it is unclear whether it was travelling from Poland or returning from Italy, as some reports suggest.

How has Germany reacted?

Chancellor Merkel said she was ""shocked and very saddened"" by the attack but added ""we don't want to live with fear of evil"".

Germany's interior ministry said Christmas markets in Berlin would remain closed on Tuesday but other markets outside of the capital will operate as normal.

A senior member of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Marcus Pretzell, blamed Mrs Merkel for the attack, linking it to her open-door migration policy which saw the arrival of more than one million people last year.

What do eyewitnesses say happened?

A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press that the 25-tonne lorry had missed him by only about three metres as it smashed through stands and knocked down a large Christmas tree.

""It was definitely deliberate,"" said the tourist.

He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.

Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed ""blood and bodies everywhere"".

""I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed.

""I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there.""

'I heard the noise and the screams'

Is this the first such attack?

A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Ten people were killed and dozens more injured in separate gun, bomb, axe and machete attacks in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg in July.

A year of terror in Germany

But Monday's incident was reminiscent of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).

The mayor of Nice, Philippe Pradal, said the Berlin incident shared the same ""blind violence"" as the attack on his city.

Both IS and al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds.

image copyrightReuters

The US labelled the tragedy an apparent ""terrorist attack"" and pledged its support.

President-elect Donald Trump blamed ""Islamist terrorists"" for a ""slaughter"" of Christians in the German capital.

""Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!"" he tweeted.

307,"As the date for the referendum on the UKs membership of the EU approaches, the focus of debate has settled on the impact that so-called Brexit would have on security, the economy and immigration.

For the financial crime-combating community, the question of Brexit brings together two of these issues: security and the economy  or, more precisely, the issue of fighting crime and the position of the UK as the leading international global financial centre. The latter point has received much media coverage, with most current practitioners in the financial sector expressing a preference to remain part of the EU given the benefits that accrue to locating a financial services business within the EU and passporting activity seamlessly into the other member states without incurring further regulatory impediments. The former issue  security/crime-fighting  has also been widely discussed by politicians and former security and intelligence leaders in broad terms; however, the impact that Brexit would have on tackling financial crime has so far been neglected.

The UK has, over the past two years, placed considerable national security emphasis on the importance of tackling financial and economic crime. The recently published Action Plan for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance reiterates the governments commitment to protecting the security and prosperity of citizens and the integrity of Britains world-leading financial system by vigorously pursuing those who abuse it for illicit means. It therefore seems right to question the extent to which this commitment would be affected by the UKs exit from the EU.

It would seem that, prima facie, leaving the EU would be entirely negative for the UKs efforts to tackle financial crime (including terrorist financing) for the simple reason that, given the globalised nature of finance, tackling the associated crime needs more, not less partnership. The former heads of the Security Service and of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI5 and MI6) have drawn attention to the importance of the cross-border data sharing within the EU on which the UK relies to help reveal the associations and activities of terrorists and cyber-attackers. This co-operation is equally imperative for combating the financing of such malevolent actors and identifying those that perpetrate extortion, money laundering and corruption.

Finance is a highly globalised industry. Payments, particularly those associated with corruption, trade-based money laundering and sanctions circumvention, are necessarily transnational and can only be disrupted if information can be exchanged between nations and financial institutions efficiently. As evidenced by the hand-wringing of international leaders after each of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe and further afield, accomplishing arrangements for the sharing of information is a challenging task. Lack of trust and different cultural approaches to  and legal positions on  data privacy frustrate, at the best of times, the sharing of information to disrupt all forms of crime and terrorism, including financial crime and the financing of terrorism.

Of course, Brexiters will retort that many of the structures created to combat financial crime and terrorist financing are themselves global and are thus unrelated to EU membership. First among these is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance. The UK is, in its own right, a leading member of this group of 35-member jurisdictions and two regional organisations, and it would continue to benefit from the FATFs work regardless of its status within the EU.

Likewise, the UK Financial Intelligence Units membership of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units would be unaffected by Brexit, as would the UKs membership of the G20 and G7, other bodies that busy themselves with matters related to financial crime and terrorist financing. Similarly, the status of the UK banks that are members of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of thirteen global banks which aims to develop frameworks and guidance for the management of financial crime risks, would also be unaffected by Brexit, since their membership is a function of their size and global importance. Yet most of these structures are focused on policy, not the operational reality of disrupting financial crime, which requires close, cross-border co-operation and information sharing.

As with everything currently discussed within the Brexit debate, the interconnectedness of the UK with other EU member states means that it is simply impossible to walk away from the EU and not continue to feel the impact of its rules and regulations. The recent Schrems case provides a timely reminder that non-EU countries data privacy laws must be  essentially equivalent  to EU law if data is to be shared with a country outside the EU. In that case, an Austrian citizen, Maximillian Schrems, argued that  contrary to the view laid out in a 2000 European Commission directive  the US did not comply with the EUs data protection standards. The European Court of Justice found that, given the 2013 Snowden revelations, the Commissions directive was now invalid. Given the significant financial links between the UK and the rest of the EU  both for business and for tackling financial crime  it is hard to imagine that the UK would risk breaking critical information-sharing links by turning its back on Brussels-derived data protection regulation, even though this regulation at times frustrates the UK governments efforts to widen its own data sharing and surveillance powers. So if the UK wants to maintain its information-sharing links it must abide by EU data protection regulation, yet leaving the EU would mean having no say in the development of this regulation.

The value of EU membership for fighting crime, particularly cross-border crime, has been well argued: it provides civil judicial co-operation measures; it provides access to EU police and criminal justice tools that ensure effective collective action and also grants access to European criminal records information. In addition to these general crime-related procedures and agreements, EU membership also gives the UK access to specific financial crime-fighting systems such as FIU.net and other initiatives run by Europol.

While some might welcome escaping the clutches of allegedly  bizarre  EU legislation such as the 4th Money Laundering Directive, which advocates greater scrutiny of domestic politicians, the globalised nature of finance and the necessarily cross-border nature of efforts to respond to associated criminality mean that  at a time when the sharing of information to combat financial crime and terrorist financing is an international imperative  any action that reduces the UKs ability to participate in information-sharing mechanisms and forums would seem counter-intuitive.

For those tasked with tackling financial crime and fulfilling the UK governments pledge to make the country a more hostile place for those seeking to move, hide or use the proceeds of crime and corruption or to evade sanctions, Brexit would be a significantly retrograde step.",nam
308,"Corruption, graft, and palm-greasing are a real and growing drag on the global economy  and they open the door to a host of evils like drug smuggling and human trafficking. Bribes to the tune of about $1.5 trillion change hands every year, according to the International Monetary Fund, or about 5 percent of global GDP.

And the true cost of corruption doesnt just boil down to money, either. You cant have narco-trafficking without bribery, human trafficking without bribery, or even terrorism without bribery, said Alexandra Wrage, president and founder of the anti-bribery organization TRACE International.

TRACE says that bribery is getting worse, with global graft on the rise, according to a new study. Some 60 percent of countries have an increased bribery risk compared with the 2014 study, while only 32 percent have a decreased bribery risk, the group says. While anti-bribery laws and enforcement are on the upswing in many countries, government transparency and capacity for civil society oversight of anti-bribery are not.

The study shows the cleanest  and most graft-prone  countries around the world, ranking countries on a scale of 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher bribery risks.

See how each country stacks up here:

Sweden comes out on top with a score of 10, followed by New Zealand at 15 and Estonia at 17. The most bribery-prone country in the world is Nigeria, with a score of 99. Russia is actually getting cleaner, TRACE says, improving from a score of 65 two years ago to 58 today. China, despite a huge anti-corruption drive in Beijing, sits immobile with a score of 66.

Even the United States even saw a slight increase in bribery risk, going from a score of 27 in 2014 to a score of 34 in 2016, though its still a lot closer to Sweden than Swaziland. The United States improved anti-bribery laws, according to the study, but saw its score rise because of increased business-to-government interactions and a slight backslide in civil society oversight of bribery.

Generally, more places have gotten worse than have gotten better, Virna Di Palma, senior director of global strategy with TRACE, told Foreign Policy. In particular, the Americas, Africa, and East Asia are backsliding on fighting corruption, Di Palma said.

Corruption hemorrhages public trust in governments. A Transparency International study released in November found, after surveying 60,000 Europeans and Central Asians, 53 percent thought their governments handled corruption poorly, while only 23 percent thought they were doing well. One in three surveyed thought their governments officials and lawmakers were mostly corrupt. Even in the supposedly cleaner and more advanced West, public ire at corruption  whether real or perceived  helps fuel populist political movements.

All is not necessarily lost, though, says Wrage. Corporate behavior is getting more legal scrutiny around the world. And if bribery scores are high now, it may be because bribery was simply more difficult to track in the past. Its not that theres more bribery, its that its more visible, Wrage said.

Companies are also learning that dirty business can be bad business, says Di Palma. Additionally, small and medium-sized companies  not just multinationals  are beginning to take anti-graft measures more seriously.

We see the world trending in the right direction, Di Palma said. Initially companies were only interested because of increased anti-bribery enforcement, but in the last few years weve seen a change, she said, adding that companies are recognizing that bribery is a bad business strategy.",nam
309,"How safe is your pension? As COVID-19 shutdowns hobble the U.S. economy, the question has taken on more urgency.

While risks associated with underfunded pensions for state and local government employees have been known for years, a new concern has arisen, pension rights advocates say. It centers on the growing trend of insurance companies taking over pensions for employees of private companies.

This is what weve worried about  when companies sell off their pension plans, said Karen Friedman, policy director at the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit focusing on workers retirement security. Is it safe to transfer money out of pension plans insured by the [government-backed] Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insurance companies where the protections for consumers are scant?

Pension obligations are costly and companies have been eager to jettison them in recent years. Insurers have been happy to take on their assets  such deals have totaled $110 billion since early 2015.

But pensions taken over by private insurers are not protected from default by the government-backed PBGC, which protects the pensions of most private company employees. In addition, insurers are regulated by the states, not the federal government, and some are now affiliated with private equity firms, whose focus is often on short-term profits which can conflict with insurers' long-term obligations.

Concerns for health insurance loom as unemployment numbers rise

June 3, 202001:31

Insurance company Athene Holding, a relative newcomer to the arena, has vaulted to the number-two position in pension buyouts. Created in 2009, Athene is affiliated with Apollo Global Management, the publicly traded private equity giant co-founded by billionaire Leon Black. Athene, whose stock trades publicly, is Apollos biggest investment. Apollo has $330 billion in assets under management, with over $100 billion related to Athene, its filings show. The insurer pays significant fees to Apollo each year  Athene's investment management fees to Apollo accounted for 27 percent of Apollo's total such fees in 2019.

Athene has acquired $12 billion in corporate pension obligations recently, including those of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dana Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Today, roughly 178,000 people rely on Athene for pension benefits, the company says. The entity taking most of the obligations is Athene Annuity & Life Co.

Athene Holding has performed well, but in the first quarter of 2020, it reported a $1.1 billion loss, in part reflecting financial market turmoil. Some $300 million of that loss came from Athenes 7 percent stake in Apollo.

Financial markets have recovered since March 31, shoring up Athenes Apollo holding.

Still, the loss raises questions about risks in Athenes investments.

Researchers at the Federal Reserve Board published a paper in February warning of risks among a handful of insurers that are structured like Athene. The study, which cited Athene as an example, concluded, Life insurers have become more vulnerable to an aggregate shock to the corporate sector.

Joseph M. Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University and a longtime authority on the industry, told NBC News that he thinks private equity firms like Apollo are not well-suited to partner with insurance companies.

I think private equity firms are in it for the quick buck and that is what troubles me, Belth said. Policyholders are pawns in the hands of people like Black.

Asked to respond, Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Apollo and Black said in a statement that Athenes and Apollos interests are closely aligned. Athene was founded with long-term capital from blue-chip insurance investors, not from a private equity fund, she said. ""Athene does not invest in Apollos flagship PE funds, nor does it lend to Apollos PE portfolio companies.""

Athene's spokeswoman, Karen Lynn, said in a statement: ""Athene strongly disagrees with various characterizations of our business asserted in this article. We are highly rated, disciplined and financially strong as one of the best-capitalized businesses in the financial sector.""

8.6 million Americans

About 8.6 million Americans over 65 are receiving pension payments from a private company plan, and millions more who are still working are paying into private plans. Most of those plans are insured through the government-backed Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. PBGC says it protects around 40 million workers in 23,400 pension plans.

When a company defaults on its pension obligations, PBGC pays the pension, in most cases. Some 84 percent of participants in private company plans taken over by the PBGC received all their vested benefits, a 2019 study showed. The remaining 16 percent saw their benefits fall by an average 24 percent. As of 2019, PBGC has assumed the pension obligations of almost 5,000 plans and more than 900,000 retirees.

When private insurance companies take over pension plans, they typically offer participants a group annuity that pays the same amount as the private plan. An annuity is an insurance contract that can provide lifetime monthly income. The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees enforcement of pension rules, has not objected to these takeovers.

However, those pensions are no longer backed by the PBGC. They are backed by the insurers, which must be disclosed when the transfer takes place.

Insurers are not regulated by the federal government. That task falls to each state in which the companies do business.

Athene Holding is based in Bermuda, while its unit Athene Annuity & Life Co. is in Iowa. In April, the New York insurance overseer accused Athene Holding of failing to register its pension takeover business there. Athene Holding paid $45 million to settle the matter, neither admitting nor denying the allegations.

State insurance regulators require insurers to file annual reports detailing their investment portfolios and the assets they have to cover policyholders claims. The key figure  surplus  is the difference between an insurers assets and liabilities. The bigger the cushion, the better.

Athene Annuity & Life, the insurer backing most of the pension obligations, has $54 billion in assets, filings show. And a $1.2 billion surplus  which is roughly $1 billion above the level at which the regulator overseeing the company would have to move in to protect policyholders.

If an insurance company gets into trouble, its assets are sold to pay policyholders' claims. If insufficient, policyholders must rely on state guaranty funds financed voluntarily by other insurers. Unlike the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has a pre-funded insurance pool protecting depositors against bank failures, state guaranty funds raise money only after a failure occurs.

States impose limits on how much policyholders can receive in a failure. In Alabama, Colorado and Iowa for example, the most annuity holders can receive is $250,000.

When Athene Annuity & Life takes over a pension, it receives assets backing those obligations from the company that formerly ran it. Athene sends 80 percent of those assets and liabilities to an affiliated reinsurer in Bermuda, the companys filings say, and keeps the remaining 20 percent in U.S. entities.

Thomas Gober, a certified fraud examiner in Virginia who analyzes insurance companies and has worked as a consultant to and witness for the U.S. Department of Justice, questioned Athenes heavy reliance on related companies to reinsure or backstop its policyholder obligations.

A strong group of independent, well-capitalized reinsurers can strengthen an insurers financial backbone, said Gober.

In a typical reinsurance or coinsurance arrangement, an insurer will pay an unrelated company to provide a backstop to cover the initial insurers obligations if necessary. Under such an arrangement, the initial and secondary insurers share profits and losses based on a preset ratio.

Athene Annuity & Lifes most recent regulatory filings show 95 percent of its reinsurance and coinsurance deals were with affiliates  $54 billion of $57 billion. This defeats the purpose of a backstop, Gober said. New York Life Insurance Co., which carries the highest ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, has zero reinsurance or coinsurance deals with affiliates.

One affiliated reinsurer is Athene Re USA IV, which provided a $1.4 billion backstop to Athene Annuity & Life as of 2019. The reinsurers risk-based capital falls well below mandatory levels, under National Association of Insurance Commissioners rules, filings show. Thats because one of the assets it uses to compute its capital  letters of credit for $137 million  is not admitted per the NAIC. Its rules dont allow letters of credit as assets because they represent the risk of a bank, not the insurance company, said David Provost, deputy commissioner of the captive insurance division of the Vermont department of regulation.

Vermont regulators, where Athene Re is domiciled, did allow the letters of credit to be included as an asset. We are making a regulatory judgment that this is acceptable, said Provost. He did not disclose the identity of the banks backing them.

Karen Lynn, a spokeswoman for Athene, said its Bermuda-based reinsurers are strong and have capital consistent with a AA-rated company. (An AA rating is considered high quality; AAA is the highest.)

But outsiders can't analyze the reinsurers' books because Bermuda doesn't require extensive public disclosures. Athenes annual Bermuda filings consist of 5 pages and few details, versus the Iowa subsidiarys over 1,000-page annual state filing. And policyholders can typically collect only from the insurer that wrote their policies, which is why the $1.2 billion in surplus held by Athene Annuity & Life Co. should be the focus, according to Gober.

Policyholders who are unfortunate enough to get caught up in an insurance company failure face another challenge: litigation can drag on for decades. In January 2020, for example, a federal appeals court ruled on a case involving money owed on an annuity written by Executive Life. That company failed in 1991.

After Executive Life collapsed, many of the insurers assets were picked up at significant discounts by Blacks firm, Apollo.

Special and symbiotic

The relationship between Apollo and Athene, the subsidiary that backs pensions, is special and symbiotic, Black told investors in March.

For Apollo, the arrangement is lucrative. Over the past three years, Athene has paid Apollo $1 billion in management fees.

For Thomas Gober, however, the relationship between the companies is problematic. There is nothing illegal about Athene's practices, but Gober sees problems with the company's relatively thin surplus, the quality of Athenes investments, and the habit of Athene of investing in Apollo-related entities. Apollo owns 35 percent of Athene, and Athene owns seven percent of Apollo.

The Federal Reserve researchers also expressed concerns, concluding that private-equity backed insurers may test the ability of the insurance industry, and the financial system more broadly to withstand direct and indirect shocks to the corporate sector.""

The Athene spokeswoman said the Fed report did not provide ""comprehensive insight into how we manage our business. We have maintained, and will continue to maintain, very strong liquidity within our diversified investment portfolio, and we take great care to invest behind predictable, surrender charge protected, long-dated policyholder obligations.""

In a corporate pension buyout, a company, say Bristol-Myers, hands its pension assets and obligations over to Athene. To meet these obligations, insurers typically invest policyholders money in corporate bonds, government obligations, and mortgages.

When an insurance company sells a policy or annuity, it agrees to pay the holder a set amount under certain circumstances. To meet these obligations, insurers typically invest policyholders money in corporate bonds, government obligations, and mortgages.

With Apollo guiding Athenes portfolio, the insurer has invested heavily in Apollo-related entities, regulatory filings show. Athene Annuity & Life holds $4.1 billion in stocks, bonds and mortgage loans of its ""parent, subsidiaries and affiliates,"" up from $172 million in 2015.

Compared with the insurers surplus of $1.2 billion, this is a troubling concentration of assets, said Gober.

Thats too many eggs in one basket and an affiliated basket, he said. If the insurer gets into trouble, the question would be whether the affiliates bonds would be collectible because the affiliates are so dependent upon the insurer for revenues.

By comparison, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corp. has total assets of $54 billion and surplus of $6.4 billion  roughly the same assets as Athene but five times the surplus. Its investments in parent, subsidiaries and affiliates total just $231 million.

NBC News asked Lynn, the Athene spokeswoman, how its policyholders can be sure these investments are good for them and not just good for Apollo affiliates. Because Apollo owns 35 percent of Athene, she said it is ""completely aligned with all Athene stakeholders to find the highest quality risk-return assets for Athenes balance sheet as possible."" She also said Athene's investment in Apollo shares would not be used to pay insurance policyholders claims, including pension benefits.

Bill Wheeler, Athene's president, said in a statement: ""The premise of your story contains the assertion that an affiliation with Apollo means more risk. This is clearly untrue."" Moreover, all of its pension takeovers ""have been vetted and selected by plan fiduciaries and committees whose sole responsibility is to consider the interest of participants and beneficiaries.""

Asked how Athene shareholders and policyholders can assess whether amounts paid in investment management fees to Apollo are fair, Lynn said Athenes relationship with Apollo has fueled the insurers high performance in recent years.

To manage the conflicts of interest arising from Athenes ties to Apollo, Lynn said the companys board has a committee that approves the deals. The transactions are also vetted by disinterested directors at Athene, with both groups advised by independent legal and financial advisers.

The conflicts committee is comprised solely of directors who are independent of Apollo, she said.

But the Athene proxy filings show all three conflicts committee members are or were directors of Apollo affiliates, including Apollo Residential Mortgage Inc., Apollo Tactical Income Fund and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.

Asked about these affiliations, Lynn said Athenes governance practices adhere to requirements set out by the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares trade. Athene declined to make the directors available.

While corporate bonds dominate Athenes investments, it is also a big buyer of commercial mortgages and securities that bundle debt together, known as collateralized loan obligations. The company also holds securities backed by aircraft leases, retailers, oil companies, car rental companies and hotels, all hurt by COVID-19 closures.

Gober studied thousands of pages in regulatory filings of Athenes major subsidiaries comparing risks in their investments with the cushion the companies have to pay policyholder claims  the surplus.

The biggest problem with the investment portfolio is it is high risk and illiquid, Gober told NBC News. Given how thin their surplus margins are, its relevant to compare how much more they have in risky stuff.

Lynn disputed the view that the companys policyholders face risks. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that any of our subsidiaries are inadequately capitalized, she said, when considering the strength and accessibility of capital across our consolidated business. Athene has more than $12 billion of consolidated statutory capital supporting $112 billion of policyholder reserves, reflecting a ratio which is meaningfully higher than other A+ and AA- rated insurers, as well as other fixed annuity providers.""

The quality of Athenes investments raises questions as well, said Gober. Its most recent filings show more than one-quarter of the securities it intends to sell before they mature were either nonrated or rated below investment grade by agencies such as Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors.

Asked whether policyholders should be concerned about these holdings, Athene says it prefers to use the ratings method put forward by NAIC. Under this system, only 5.7 percent of the securities are rated below investment grade, its filings say.

Athenes filings also warn that many of our invested assets are relatively illiquid, meaning potentially difficult to sell. The company relies on Apollo for risk management support, its filings say.",nam

311,"For well over a year Malaysias mystery tycoon, Taek Jho Low has been adamantly denying his links with the shadowy sovereign wealth fund 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

As recently as this March the US public relations firm Edleman issued a statement on Jho Lows behalf, again denying that his flamboyant investment activities are supported with Malaysian public money borrowed by the fund.

The statement, which was made to the online business news portal Mkini Biz vouched:

Neither Low nor any company in which Low is a shareholder has ever received any compensation directly from TIA [Terengganu Investment Authority], 1MDB or the Government of Malaysia, or from any activity related to TIA

But, now research by Sarawak Report has identified UK High Court evidence, which shows that Mr Taik Jho Lows claims are at best misleading and certainly open to serious question.

We can demonstrate that in January 2011 1MDB submitted a letter on behalf of Low and his private equity company The Wynton Group pledging to back a share purchase of the prestige Coroin hotel group (which includes the leading London hotels Claridges, The Connaught and The Berkeley) against rival bids from the UKs Barclay brothers.

That pledge backed Wynton to the tune of a final offer of £1.028 billion (RM5.7billion)!

As it turned out, the shareholders turned down the Malaysian bid, in favour of what they viewed as a more reliable lower offer for the shares.

Evidence backed by a judge

The details of the Coroin bid and the involvement by 1MDB in Jho Lows privately owned company Wynton Groups attempted buy out are clearly detailed in a 158 page judgement produced on 10th August 2012 by Justice David Richards of the Chancery Division of Britains Royal Courts of Justice.

In the interests of transparency it is available for all to read online.

The judgement details how in 2011 rival bidders were attempting to buy up a controlling number of shares in the Coroin Group from the distressed businessman Derek Quinlan (approximately 39% of the company).

The property magnates known as the Barclay brothers were to emerge as the victors in the takeover, but other shareholders questioned their methods, resulting in the legal case and ensuing judgement by Justice Richards.

In the course of that judgement the judge recorded a number of other bids that had been made during the takeover rivalry and one of those came from Malaysias Jho Low representing The Wynton Group along with his brother.

The judge made it clear on a number of occasions that Low was representing himself and his company as an entity backed by a Malaysian Government sovereign wealth fund. In this court document the British judge begins by relating:

The Malaysian based investor was Jho Low, a businessman with some backing from
a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. Through an entity called The Wynton Group,
offers were made to the company and its shareholders in January and February
2011?[ Approved Judgement  Patrick McKillen v. Misland (Cyprus) Investments Ltd & 10 others  Royal Courts of Justice Para 50 ]

However, it is clear that the British businessmen selling the shares were not convinced either by Mr Low or the trustworthiness of the Malaysian Government support, according to the judge. As he put it these [offers] were not at the time taken seriously by most of the shareholders [paragraph 50].

1MDB provided a written support offering to back Jho Lows bid

But Jho Low did not give up. He later came back with further strengthened bids and he produced a number of written third party assurances as well, including a letter of 15th January 2011 from 1MDB confirming its support of the offer, as recorded by the judge.

It is these which provide the damning evidence that despite all the denials by the Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is the Chairman of the fund and by Jho Low himself, the private equity dealings of this youthful tycoon have been linked to and closely supported by 1MDB.

The twenty six year old big-spending tycoon also had the backing of a Malaysian bank explained the judge and Jho Low himself claimed in a further letter that financing for the offer had been in principle fully underwritten by the Malaysian government:

As mentioned earlier, it appears that Wynton was controlled by a Malaysian businessman, Jho Low, and his brother. In mid-December 2010, advisers to Wynton made an indicative offer for the shares of the company. Mr McKillen [a shareholder] met Jho Low and his advisers at Claridges on 29 December 2010. A revised letter of intent was sent to the shareholders on 3 January 2011, proposing an acquisition of all the shares on the basis of an enterprise value of £1 billion, subject to due diligence and agreement of documentation including warranties and indemnities. An accompanying letter from a Malaysian Bank indicated that it was intended to seek to raise up to £950 million of debt and/or mezzanine finance and £50-£100 million of equityThe provision on 15 January 2011 of a letter from 1 Malaysian Berhad, an investment vehicle wholly owned by the Malaysian government, confirming its support for the offer, did not allay the concerns of the majority of the shareholders. A further letter from Wynton dated 24 January 2011 stated that the financing for the offer had in principle been fully underwritten by Malaysian government-backed investment funds. [Judge Richards  Paragraph 135-138]

As the above makes clear, however, despite the formal letter of support by 1 Malaysian (sic) Berhad, the UK shareholders did not feel confident it was a reliable offer.

The judge explains:

Mr Murphy on Mr Quinlans behalf described it as pure fantasy  In an email dated 11 January 2011, after Mr McKillen had had his meeting in Doha on 9 January 2011, he wrote my sense is that it is an offer that cant really be delivered either in time or structure. The delivery of the Malaysian government bond is not guaranteed and the deal may end up in an open ended bridging situation because it does not have the proper financing. I also sense that some Malaysian government may have a political motive and that will naturally delay execution. I am conscious that on paper the Malaysian deal is better to me personally, however, we should be looking at credibility and execution. Mr McLaughlin was of the same view. Even Mr Buchanan was not confident that Wynton would deliver

The comments show a devastating lack of confidence by these top businessmen in the credibility of Jho Low and also the Malaysian Government.

However, it confirms that the offer referred to by Justice Richards had been placed on the table with the written backing of 1MDB for a bid of just over £1billion pounds.

Denials

Contrast this enormous commitment with the series of denials, as all concerned have sought to distance 1MDB from the controversial night-clubbing pal of Najibs step-son Riza Aziz.

The role of Jho Low as far as 1MDB is concerned is zero, said 1MDB CEO Datuk Shahrol Halmi, denying that Low has received compensation for his previous role in the firm. [ Malaysia online ]

Despite this, in company CVs Low does acknowledge links to unspecified sovereign wealth funds.

The line appears to be that his investors are all from the Middle East and are the parents of kids he made friends with at school in the UK and US.

Its a pity that Jho Lows most famous and closest acquaintance appears to be the fellow Malaysian Riza Aziz, whose Dad is the PM and head of 1MDB from which billions are currently inadequately accounted for.

Time to stop hiding the truth

With so much information now contradicting the party-loving Jho Lows various versions of his life story, leading from college grad to major tycoon in no time flat, it is time for the truth.

The Chairman of 1MDB, Prime Minister Najib Razak, should explain transparently exactly which projects the fund has supported or offered to support, rather than relying on the pathetically over-due annual report that came out last week, which admits merely that the money is being invested by an anonymous fund manager in the Cayman Islands on anonymous projects with no guarantees whatsoever that the funds are secure!

These are billions of ringgit of public money borrowed at high interest rates supposedly to invest in Malaysian development.

Yet the money has gone no where near Malaysia and no no one is telling where it is or what it is being used for.

It is even being invested at a lower rate of interest than Najib borrowed it for in the first place!

We have questions

The only exception to this news blackout about what has happened to all this borrowed public money has come from the evidence we have now obtained from this British law case, showing that back in 2011 1MDB funds were offered to secure the purchase of some London Hotels by a private company owned by 26 year old Taek Jho Low!

Sarawak Report is therefore entitled to question certain matters that are hard to explain, unless Jho Low is still being supported by 1MDB. Key queries include:

 Was the US$100 million upfront investment by Najibs step-son Riza Azizs company Red Granite Productions in the film Wolf of Wall Street in any way financed or guaranteed by 1MDB?

 Does Jho Lows lavish expenditure on entertainment, which has broken records in nightclubs in many of the worlds most expensive hot spots, owe in any way to support from Malaysias publicly funded sovereign wealth fund?

 Was the reason Jho Low gained a rare personal credit at the end of Wolf of Wall Street because it was he who financed the entire film project, as people who worked on the project understood was the case?

 Since Jho Low has been demonstrated as having employed a guarantee from 1MDB to back his personal buy-out attempt of a London hotel group, is it not fair to conclude that Jho Low is in fact an agent for the fund and is acting to transfer this public money into private hands abroad rather than investing it in Malaysian development?

Libel?

When Sarawak Report first asked about the sources of Riza Azizs enormous funds, libel threats were issued by the Hollywood lawyers Loeb & Loeb, threatening immediate action unless the posts were removed.

The posts were neither removed nor amended and four months later the threats have not been carried out.

Indeed it is now Loeb & Loeb who are removed from the brief and Red Granite Productions have hired a separate legal team.

A subpoena is believed to exist for Riza Azizs financial records with the Hollywood wealth management company NKSFB, where his account manager is Debra Johnson.

Debra is the wife of Channing Johnson, who was the senior partner at Loeb & Loeb in charge of overseeing the legal threats against Sarawak Report by Red Granite Productions.",nam

In South Africa Standard Bank accepts a letter verifying a persons address from a tribal chief for certain accounts, while Postbank offers a Mzansi account, which does not require any proof of address but only offers basic transactional services and has a balance limit of 25,000 South African Rand (£1,362).

However, international banking standards set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Taskforce recommend that people opening an account provide specific documents. These know your customer (KYC) guidelines are not new, and have prevented poorer communities from accessing bank accounts for years. But there is increasing concern that KYC is becoming more restrictive, making access to finance harder for local banks and populations and damaging developing economies opportunity to grow.

KYC requires banks to check that potential customers are not involved in money laundering or terrorism by providing a verified proof of identity and address when opening an account. This is difficult for people living in informal housing or rural areas, who rarely have utility bills or lease agreements as proof.

Richard Ketley, director of international economics consultancy firm Genesis Analytics, says although South Africa allows its banks to offer simple accounts without proof of address, some banks have ceased offering them because they were unprofitable. He says the South African government has also failed to address the needs of migrant communities, who do not have identification documents. Not having a bank account means people risk losing their savings and makes them targets for criminals.

In many lower-income markets research shows poor people are enormously exposed to loss of savings through theft, he says. They keep money under the bed, get robbed, the house burns down, or they bury money and someone else digs it up.

Instead of loosening KYC criteria to improve financial inclusion, however, banks are tightening implementation more than ever before. Three years ago, partly in response to the global financial crisis, the Financial Action Taskforce recommended that countries toughen sanctions against banks that fail to deliver on anti money-laundering and terrorism checks. In August 2014, Standard Chartered had to pay $300m to the New York State Department of Financial Services after its screening systems failed to spot suspicious transactions in UAE. As a result, the bank closed thousands of accounts with small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the country.

Closing such international accounts, known as derisking, hurts developing countries because without relationships with big international banks, accessing finance for importing and exporting goods and transferring money abroad becomes harder and more expensive. Roy Melnick, an associate director working on money laundering for PwC South Africa, says the global standards for safeguarding are there for good reasons, but derisking disproportionately affects innocent people. Probably 99.9% of the population is law-abiding, its that 0.1% that make it so much more difficult for the rest, he says.

Banks have become particularly cautious of money transfer services such as Western Union, which are perceived as particularly open to abuse. Somalia has no formal banking service, so when Barclays Bank tried to close its Somali MSB services in 2013, removing the only money transfer service available in the country, it faced outcry. The issue was taken to the high court, which ruled Barclaysmust continue its Somali banking services. The example illustrates how vulnerable some countries are.

The cost of meeting regulations is another reason banks are increasingly closing international relationships. Banks have to prove annually they have sufficient money laundering and terrorism prevention procedures in place for every bank with which they connect. According to KYC Exchange Net AG managing director Joachim von Hänisch, this can cost the bank £10,000 for each reporting process. The bank running the checks also incurs expenses. If a bank isnt making enough money from a relationship with another bank then its simply not worthwhile, he says. Banks see derisking as a simpler solution.

Hänischs company addresses the problem by encouraging banks to use a standard, online reporting platform, KEN, that enables local banks to produce a single report a year. Three international banks have already signed up to the system since it launched in January 2014. Hänisch says it saves banks time and money, and could dissuade them from closing relationships.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also trying to tackle the problem. As a non-commercial entity, it finances trade in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but carries the risk itself. Deputy director of financial institutions Rudolf Putz says in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Armenia, EBRD is one of the few international institutions still providing trade finance facilities. We have sufficient staff and money to analyse and take risk, which commercial banks would not be able to do, he says.

He is concerned that if countries are unable to access trade finance from international banks, people will be forced to manage money in riskier ways. Ironically, this is exactly what KYC set out to prevent.",nam

314,"SAN ANGELO  Days after being sworn in as Chief Deputy of the Tom Green County Sheriff's office, a retired Texas Ranger announced his run to become the next sheriff.

A crowd gathered around the Tom Green County Courthouse steps on the cloudy Monday afternoon as John ""Nick"" Hanna made the announcement.

""I retired (from the Texas Rangers) because I wanted to bring my experience in tough situations, my judgement and my West Texas character and values,"" Hanna said. ""I wanted to bring it home to Tom Green County where I could focus specifically on this county.""

Hanna, if elected, plans to continue high standards for the sheriff's office and said he looks forward to the challenges ahead.

The career of Texas Ranger John ""Nick"" Hanna

Hanna started his long career in law enforcement with the Big Spring Police Department in 1989 before eventually moving on to the Department of Public Safety. He stayed with DPS for 24 years, 16 of which were with Ranger Company ""E.""

In that 16 year span, Hanna would become well-known in a case that rocked the country. At Eldorado in 2008, the YFZ Ranch was raided in a case involving the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints group and child sexual assault.

At the time of the initial distress call, he was the closest Ranger. In a 2018 interview, Hanna revealed his experience in the huge case.

""To this day, Im still super proud of our State, Eldorado and San Angelo, and of course the Rangers, and our many law enforcement partners for interrupting a culture of sexual abuse in the FLDS community, which other states hadnt been able to accomplish.""

He started as an investigator, then quickly became an evidence custodian and a case agent. His efforts stretched international lines, earning recognition by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2017.

Sgt. Terry Jacklin of the RCMP noted that Hanna's assistance helped bring several FLDS members to trial, resulting in criminal convictions for the transportation of underage girls across international lines for the purpose of sexual abuse.

Hanna was also involved in the investigations of Brandon Lawson's mysterious disappearance, the cold case death investigations of Sally McNelly and Shane Stewart and the murder of Naomi Michelle Miller.",nam
315,"SINGAPORE - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has intensified efforts to stamp out money laundering and terrorism financing, but more could still be done, assistant managing director Chua Kim Leng said on Thursday (July 27).

Mr Chua told a financial crime seminar organised by the Association of Banks in Singapore that stepping up such efforts is ever more important today as criminals are constantly finding more creative ways to perpetrate crimes, be it laundering money, financing terrorism or weapons proliferation, or engaging in fraud or insider trading.

Technology can help, he added, noting that the MAS is working closely with a group of banks in Singapore that have come together to build a joint utility for Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.

""Robust KYC processes are the frontline of our defences. The utility... can free up resources and allow banks to focus on the more complex aspects of customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, including monitoring and investigating unusual and suspicious transactions,"" he said.

""A well-designed and well-executed utility can also offer efficiencies of scale and reduce the need for customers to provide the same information to multiple institutions.""

Such a utility is pertinent, as the MAS has observed, through the course of its supervisory work and industry engagement, that one common way criminals get their funds into the financial system is by abusing offshore companies and investment funds.

""A small number of individuals may use trust and company service providers to set up a large number of corporate structures in multiple countries. Many of these are shell companies with no apparent economic purpose,"" he said.

These companies and investment funds open numerous bank accounts in different jurisdictions, then move large sums of money back and forth among themselves.

Such ""layering"" and ""pass-through"" methods are used to disguise the origin and ultimate destination of the money, as well as the true beneficiaries and purpose of these transactions.

And so banks need to know their customers well, and be alert to patterns, behaviours and transactions that are inconsistent with what they know of their customers' wealth, business and risk profile, because these could potentially be tell-tale signs of illicit activities, Mr Chua said.

He added that there is also room in the area of transactions monitoring and, here, technology could also help.

Current systems largely flag out transactions based on pre-set rules, thresholds and scenarios, which generate a high rate of false positives. These alerts require extensive human effort to review.

""Throwing more 'warm bodies' at the problem is not a sustainable solution,"" he said.

""This is where better use of technology can help. The next generation of surveillance systems utilise sophisticated, techniques, such as machine learning, which can help identify unusual patterns of transactions across a network of entities and across time.""",nam
316,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said action against a few corrupt entities should not be seen as the government crackdown on the corporate sector, as he sought to allay doubts over his regime's intentions.

Speaking at centenary celebrations of Kirloskar Brothers, he said the attempt was to allow the industry to create wealth fearlessly in a transparent environment where there are no obstacles.

In this endeavour, the government is attempting to rid the industry of web of laws, the Prime Minister said, adding during the past five years his government has worked honestly.

The attempt has been to bring transparency, efficiency and accountability in tax system, and reduce human interface with the tax department, he said.

Also, corporate tax has been reduced to their lowest so as to propel corporates to invest, he said.

The Prime Minister asked industry to shun pessimism, saying the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with India Inc in its attempt to expand business in any nook and corner of the country.

317,"Carolyn Campbell, founding partner of a $2 billion private equity fund focused on Africa, is bullish about the continent and quick to note that 14 African countries have better ratings on public integrity (pdf) than India, while 35 are seen as less corrupt than Russia, generating favorable comparisons with two other fast-growing economies seen as more welcoming to foreign investors than Africa.

But one thing Campbell says that her fund, Emerging Capital Partners, cant do is fill the massive gap in public investment in basic infrastructure: Europe, rebuilding after the devastation of World War II, spent 8% of its GDP on infrastructure. Today, China and India spend between 6% and 7%, while more mature economies spend about 3%. African countries average just 2% of public spending on infrastructure.

These types of comparisons arent easy to make across countries or time periods of fluctuating public spending; heres a more granular view produced by McKinsey in January 2013, with Africas spending rolled into the Middle East:

For investors like Campbell, this deficit can be seen as an opportunity. Africas growth leaders, including Nigeria, Ghana, Mozambique, and Ethiopia, are set to expand their economies at rates of 6% or more this yearand thats with relative underinvestment in infrastructure.

This week, African leaders have gathered in Washington for several days of talks with US officials, with the hopes of encouraging more foreign investment, particularly for electricity generation in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of the population lacks access to power. Not coincidentally, the summits other main theme is reducing corruption, including illicit financial flows made possible by US law. The challenge of infrastructure investment is that the public sectors participation, the amount of cash involved and the propensity of such projects to go completely over-budget makes corruption a much bigger risk.

Managing the spending needed to make up this deficit, estimated at about $90 billion a year by the World Bank in 2010, and the vast differences in the providers of major infrastructure investmentfrom the Chinas opaque investments and aid from Western governments to domestic tax dollars and private investmentwill help determine whether African markets can replicate the miraculous catch-up growth seen in other developing countries.",nam

319,"Intelligence  artificial or real  is only as good as the information it uses. Location intelligence helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. How can location intelligence be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives to help combat financial crime?

Introduction

Intelligence (artificial or real) is only as good as the information it uses. A higher volume of relevant information provides deeper context to a situation, resulting in heightened intelligence, increased value, and better outcomes.

Location intelligence is a data asset that helps contextualize a situation and can augment machine learning and other applications of artificial intelligence. This post considers how location intelligence can be applied to regulatory compliance initiatives, specifically fraud examination and forensic audit, to combat financial crime.

Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit

Fraud examination is the discipline of resolving allegations of fraud from tips, complaints, or accounting clues. It involves obtaining documentary evidence, interviewing witnesses and potential suspects, writing investigative reports, testifying to findings, and assisting in the general detection and prevention of fraud *.

Forensic audit is the process of investigation used to build a case that supports fraud examination. It is the intersection of financial principles and the law, and therefore, applies the following:

Technical skills of accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, and certain areas of the law and research;
Investigative skills for the collection, analysis and evaluation of evidential matter; and
Critical thinking to interpret and communicate the results of an investigation.

Points 2 and 3, above, are particularly relevant to this post. The collection and analysis of evidential matter needs a variety of data assets to support a comprehensive investigation. Critical thinking  sometimes referred to as lateral thinking, or thinking outside the box  is a disciplined approach to problem solving and guides our thought process and related actions. Critical thinking is required to contextualize patterns and connections across evidential matter.

Location Intelligence Is Context

Think about where you are right now. You may be at a specific address. If you have location services enabled on your phone, you are also located at specific coordinates relative to the rest of the world. However, the intelligence of your location is more than that.

The neighborhood that you are in can be characterized by demographics and consumer preferences. It also can be described in relation to the proximity of other neighborhoods that may have similar or very different characteristics. The people around you have mobile devices that are interacting with social media, streaming a live event, or making a purchase. Video is capturing movement, and machine sensors are analyzing usage and scheduling maintenance.

Location intelligence applies the multiple layers of information that surround you. The better you are able to logically connect these layers of information, the more location intelligence you have.

Back to Evidential Matter

Location intelligence continues to grow as a critical component of analytics, and it is being applied to more and more scenarios across industries through social media, connected devices, distributed systems, the internet of everything, and overlaying all of that with just about any dataset that can be collected.

In financial services, location intelligence provides an important and actionable level of information that ties together a customer profile, from on-boarding to know-your-customer and financial crime investigations. Referring back to Fraud Examination and Forensic Audit, above, location intelligence can be a critical component of evidential matter.

A Scenario

Party A is a bank customer that, by all accounts, is squeaky clean.
Party A executes a financial transaction with Party B from a place Party A has never been to before.
Party B registered their place of business as being in an upscale business park, but a satellite view shows that the actual location is in an abandoned industrial area.
Party B makes many transactions with Party C that very closely correlates to the sum that was originally sent from Party A.
Party C is located in very close proximity to a HIFCA designated zone. [To get a sense of what proximity risk is, look at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) and High Intensity Financial Crime Area (HIFCA).]

Should Party A be investigated? It is a questionable circumstance, at least.

As it relates to forensic audit, location intelligence provides additional layers of information that tighten the interrelationship among auditing, fraud examination and financial forensics in a dynamic way that adapts to political, social, and cultural pressures over time.

Summary

Fraud examination and forensic audit encompasses much more than just the review of financial data; it also involves techniques such as interviews, statement analyses, public records searches, and forensic document examination to identify questionable circumstances.

Location intelligence can help identify transaction anomalies more quickly, verify customer place of business visually and more efficiently, and flag sensitive cross-border conditions and proximity risk. All of these are vital in securing the proper documentation needed in a robust forensic examination.

*Notes:

The organizations obligation is to report suspicious activity, not to stop it, by submitting a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report). There are two levels to this:

Level 1 - The Sniff Test: A questionable activity or a correlation of circumstances is identified (Something seems fishy here).
Level 2 - Investigation: A disproportionate amount of time can be spent manually collecting supporting documentation. A good set of data access tools that links relevant data points, including location intelligence, can optimize this process, making it faster and with better quality.",nam

321,"Tehran, Iran  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said it does not matter who wins a surprisingly tight US presidential election and that his country has planned for difficult conditions in the future.

In a televised speech on Wednesday, the Iranian leader said whoever the next president in Washington was, he should respect international treaties and laws.

We want to be respected, not subject to sanctions [by the US]. No matter who wins the US election What we want is for the US to return to law to return to international and multilateral accords, he said in reference to a nuclear deal Iran signed with world powers in 2015.

In May 2018, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the landmark deal and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran.

His Democratic challenger Joe Biden says he will return to the nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Iran in an effort to restart wider negotiations.

Rouhani on Wednesday said if the next US administration chooses to change course, that could change facts on the ground, but that Iran is not holding its breath and would prepare for the worst.

We have planned based on the assumption that the methods and behaviours of the US will not return to the correct approach, he said.

If the Americans come to a realisation  that they must choose another way, so much the better. But if not, our decisions are based on how to run the country if conditions are difficult.

Since abandoning the nuclear deal, Trump has followed a maximum pressure campaign that has blacklisted the entire Iranian financial sector.

The long sanctions have significantly damaged the Iranian economy, leading to sharp currency devaluation and high inflation.

Iran says it will not be pressured to renegotiate the nuclear deal and will adhere to all its commitments once the US lifts all sanctions and returns to the negotiating table.

In a speech on Tuesday, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the outcome of the US presidential elections would not affect Iranian policy towards the US.

Some people talk about what will happen if this or that one is elected. Yes, certain events may happen but they dont concern us. Our policy is calculated and clear. he said.",nam
322,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has begun work on a regulatory structure for digital currencies such as bitcoin, its central bank governor said on Wednesday, aimed at further securing Malaysia against money-laundering and terrorism financing.

Governor Muhammad Ibrahim told a counter-terrorism financing summit that from next year those converting crypto currencies into conventional currency will be designated as reporting institutions under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act.

Reporting institutions are required by law to undertake preventive measures to prevent their firms from being used as a conduit for money laundering and terrorism financing activities, according to the central bank.

This is to prevent the abuse of the system for criminal and unlawful activities and ensuring the stability and integrity of the financial system, Muhammad said.

He did not say when the regulations would be finalised.

Commenting on terrorism financing in Malaysia, Muhammad said the total number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from financial institutions have increased this year.

In the first six months of this year, Malaysian authorities received 346 STRs related to terrorism financing which have led to 34 disclosures to law enforcement agencies, compared to 93 reports in 2015, the central bank governor said.

Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. The Southeast Asian country has been on high alert since suicide bombers and gunmen linked to Islamic State launched multiple attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in January 2016.

A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June last year wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, the first such attacks on Malaysian soil.

Meanwhile, Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the country has been sharing intelligence with Indonesia, Malaysia and others in the region for many years.

Any information that we have that is relevant to the security of our friends in the region, we will share. My expectation is that will be reciprocated, Keenan said at the summit.",nam
323,"Corruption Watch

ONE of the most progressive pieces of legislation to fight corruption is the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act (Chapter 10:31).

The law was enacted in 2018 to provide for the proper governance of public entities in order to comply with Chapter 9 of the Constitution, which speaks to principles of good public administration and leadership.

The Act also provides a uniform mechanism for regulating the conditions of service of members of public entities and their senior employees.

Section 194 of the Constitution outlines the basic values and principles governing public administration as follows:

A high standard of professional ethics;

Efficient and economical use of resources;

Development-oriented public administration;

Impartiality and fairness in the provision of services;

Public participation in policy-making;

Public administration which is accountable to Parliament and the people;

Cooperation between institutions and agencies of Government at all levels;

Provision of timely, accessible and accurate information;

Cultivating good human resource management and career development practices to maximise human potential;

Public administration broadly representative of the diverse communities of Zimbabwe; and Employment, training and advancement practices based on merit, ability, objectivity, fairness, the equality of men and women and inclusion of persons with disabilities.

I have repeatedly pointed out that the bulk of the job of fighting corruption would be accomplished by the mere implementation of these basic values and principles. Transparency and accountability are at the heart of all these values and principles. Transparency means that decisions taken and their enforcement are done in a manner that follows rules and regulations.

It also means that information is freely available and directly accessible to those who will be affected by such decisions and their enforcement.

It also means that enough information is provided, and that it is provided in easily understandable forms and media.

Accountability is a key requirement for the successful fight against corruption. Not only governmental institutions but also the private sector and civil society organisations must be accountable to the public and to their institutional stakeholders.

In general, an organisation or an institution is accountable to those who will be affected by its decisions or actions. Accountability cannot be enforced without transparency and the rule of law.

That is exactly what the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act is trying to achieve. I must applaud the Office of the President and Cabinet Corporate Governance Unit for championing reforms in public entities corporate governance practices.

These reforms are in line with global trends.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), State-owned enterprises today account for over a fifth of the worlds largest enterprises as opposed to 10 years ago where only one or two of the enterprises could be found at the top of the league table.

This means that high standards of corporate governance of these entities are critical to ensure financial stability and sustain global growth.

One of the key reforms being actively considered by Government in order to bring sanity in State-owned enterprises is adopting the decentralised ownership model and move away from the current centralised ownership whereby line ministries act as the owners and regulatory authorities at the same time.

In its publication entitled, Ownership and Governance of State-Owned Enterprises: A Compendium of National Practices (2018), the OECD says most of the countries it had surveyed had either adopted a centralised model for State ownership, had established a central holding company for an important portfolio of State-owned enterprises, or had established a central co-ordinating agency, often charged with monitoring performance or co-ordinating governance practices across the State-owned enterprise sector.

Some countries had a highly decentralised system, with the ownership of State-owned enterprises being exercised by a multitude of line ministries and no co-ordinating agency in place.

Adoption of this model in Zimbabwe may assist in addressing the issue of newly-appointed ministers moving quickly to dissolve State-owned enterprises boards and appointing their own people.

Mr Willard Manungo, the Secretary for State Enterprise Reform, Corporate Governance and Procurement, recently told a virtual meeting organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe, and the Public Accountants and Auditors Board that Government was cognisant of the need for continuous reform of the governance of State-owned enterprises by aligning laws that govern these entities with Section 2 of Second Schedule of Public Entities Corporate Governance Act, which includes separation of ownership functions from other State functions.

This is popularly known as the decentralised governance model. This governance reform is already being implemented in various countries and it has reduced corruption practices in their State enterprises sector, Mr Manungo said.

There are several provisions in the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act which if enforced can ensure the principles of public administration and leadership outlined above are given life.

The Act has provisions which promote disclosure and transparency, which are key provisions of an effective law in the fight against corruption.

Section 34 requires a member of a board or senior staff member of a public entity to disclose any interest they may have in any matter under board consideration. Section 11 requires full disclosure of members appointed to public entities boards with regard to qualifications, other boards they sit on and criteria of appointing them.

The list of all members with disclosures shall be kept up-to-date and available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times during the Ministrys normal office hours.

Sections 13 (5) and 19 (6) require that a copy of model conditions of service and of any amendment or replacement be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the public entity.

Section 22 (4) requires that a copy of the strategic plan be made available in electronic form for inspection by members of the public on the website of the unit and of the entity. Section 30 requires that Board Charters and Codes of Ethics be kept at the State Enterprise and Parastatals office, where they may be inspected by members of the public free of charge at all reasonable times during the entitys business hours.

Part IV of Public Entities Corporate Governance (General) Regulations 2018, provides for the declaration of assets by board members and senior staff members of public entities. Another important provision is Section 23 (10) of the regulations which protect a board member or employee of a public entity who, in good faith, submits objections to questionable instructions.

Such officers who report on a questionable instruction shall not be dismissed or have their contract of appointment or employment terminated or any measure or sanction of a disciplinary nature on account of their objections to questionable instructions.

When it comes to investigations, Section 40 allows special investigations to be undertaken at any Public Entity with regards to affairs or dealings of the entity.

The investigations can take the form of forensic audits. This provision gives room for detecting any corrupt practices.

Governments make commitments to adopt international standards on fighting corruption. This has seen Zimbabwe ratify and domesticate standards enshrined in international conventions aimed at combating corruption and corruption-related offences.

In this regard, Zimbabwe is a signatory to the following corruption related Conventions: the United Nations Convention against Corruption (ratified on March 8, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (ratified on December 12, 2007); the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (acceded to on July 20, 1993); the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (ratified on December 17, 2006); and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol against Corruption (ratified on October 8, 2004).

The adoption of the principles from these conventions is now part of the Zimbabwean law that deals with corruption.

Therefore, the legal framework is in line with international best practice in terms of fighting corruption.

These international commitments also send a positive signal on Governments intention and seriousness in adopting international standards in fighting corruption.

The legal framework in Zimbabwe to fight corruption, which is aligned to internationally acceptable standards, provides basic benchmarks for an effective legal framework.

The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) will, however, continue to push for further legal reforms to ensure the legal framework is water-tight to curb corruption.

Mr Manungo is indeed correct when he says legislation has the effect of deterring corruption by making it costly to engage in corruption practices through surcharges, fines or custodial penalties.

And to ensure enforcement of any law, he says there should be strong institutions that have powers, skills and reputation to detect corruption and enforce the law.",nam
324,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is ready to work with whoever wins the U.S. election, two top Turkish officials said on Friday, despite a friendship with President Donald Trump that has helped the two countries through turbulent times.

Regardless of which candidate takes office in the U.S., we will pursue a sincere approach to improve our relations, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.

The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankaras closer ties with Moscow, its ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and an erosion of rights in Turkey.

Cavusoglu said Turkey had worked with Democrat and Republican administrations alike and overcome difficulties with both.

He spoke as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took a narrow lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia, putting the White House within Bidens reach as undecided states continued to count votes.

Washington has threatened sanctions on Turkey for purchasing Russian missile defence systems but Trumps administration has avoided imposing sanctions.

Of course, individuals have an impact, positive and negative. The sincere friendship between our president and Mr. Trump continued through the most difficult times, Cavusoglu said.

Analysts say Turkeys bilateral ties could suffer if Biden becomes U.S. president. The lira, which is already trading at a record low against the dollar, could come under more pressure.

However Erdogans top aide, Vice President Fuat Oktay, said Ankara was not afraid of sanctions.

No country, including America, has the chance to implement a foreign policy, programme or policy in the region in spite of Turkey or by excluding Turkey, Oktay told broadcaster A Haber.

In the face of these advancements, banks and fintech companies are starting to collaborate, but that collaboration often fails to effectively address fundamental risks associated with money laundering and other financial crimes.

When a bank partners with a startup firm, the risks related to anti-money-laundering compliance have particularly attracted the attention of global financial services regulators. And all too often, bank leaders are nervous about pursuing a relationship or new account with a fintech company because of the AML and regulatory concerns. Monitoring a fintech partner over time can also amplify overhead spending. For example, internal AML systems often need to be adjusted to account for fintech data and relevant risks, and expanded resources may be needed to effectively perform and document ongoing due diligence of the fintech providers' adherence to AML roles and responsibilities.

Each of a bank's accounts, partnerships and other relationships with fintech companies is unique, and each requires thorough vetting and due diligence before the bank determines whether a fintech company fits into its culture, risk boundaries and strategy.

These three strategies can help banks manage AML concerns of working with a fintech partner.

Define Risk Appetite and Tolerance
AML compliance officers should have discussions with their senior management teams and boards of directors about the impact of fintech on the traditional banking system and strategies related to the consideration of becoming partners with fintech companies. As opposed to establishing a blanket prohibition of certain types of customers, such as those processing third-party payment activity, the bank should consider the attributes, criteria and market compensation that it would find appropriate, and the infrastructure and resources that would be needed to effectively manage the risks associated with such companies.

Each time a new potential fintech relationship or other opportunity arises, it is far easier and more efficient to assess the new business opportunity against an existing board-approved statement of the bank's risk appetite and tolerance than it is for the compliance officer to chase down the personal opinion of key decision-makers throughout a bank.

Be Assertive
Does the bank want access to the fintech company's customer data to better support transaction monitoring, customer risk rating, and sanctions screening? If so, the bank should ask for it directly. Fintech companies generally have a lot of data, and most are more than willing to share permissible information with banks if it means being able to retain a strategic banking relationship.

Better yet, the bank and fintech company should have a contractual agreement about the format, frequency and content of the data the fintech company would provide, and the bank should integrate the data directly into its AML systems. A seamless integration of data within a bank's AML systems can improve both efficiency and assurance that money laundering risks are being appropriately addressed.

Regulate Your Partners
The bank needs to clearly define the AML requirements, roles and responsibilities that are expected of a fintech company that maintains an account with the bank. The two parties should develop a formal agreement stating those roles, and the bank should hold the fintech company to its contractual requirements.

An agreement could include such requirements for the fintech company to meet as retaining qualified AML compliance personnel, undergoing annual AML audits performed by a bank-approved and trusted vendor and supplying ongoing AML metrics related to agreed-upon AML performance or risk indicators. Banks that clearly define such responsibilities  and, more important, monitor adherence to them over time  are more likely to be able to monitor and respond effectively to changing AML risks or deteriorating AML controls in a timely manner.

Ideally, the depth, breadth and frequency of the bank's ongoing due diligence and testing will align with the areas of elevated risk the company presents.

The age of digital disruption in the financial services industry has only begun, but unfortunately many bankers and fintech companies are partnering without addressing the relevant risks. It is time for them to collaborate to tackle the emerging AML risks of the fintech boom.",nam
326,"Democrat Mark Kelly has defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona, NBC News projected on Friday, giving Democrats a Senate pickup in the state.

Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, declared himself the winner earlier in the week.

""I am deeply honored that Arizonans have trusted me to be their next United States Senator and to serve in this seat once held by Senator John McCain,"" he said in a series of tweets Wednesday night.

""We woke up today still facing a pandemic, a struggling economy, and deep division in our country,"" he wrote. ""We need to slow the spread of the virus, get our economy back on track, and defend health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And I know that together, we can.""

Kelly, 56, is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in 2011 at a constituent event. The couple founded the Giffords Foundation, which supports gun control laws around the country.

The win puts both of the states Senate seats in the hands of Democrats - Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. Sinema congratulated Kelly in a tweeted statement Wednesday. ""I am confident Mark will uphold the Arizona values of seeking common ground and putting country above party,"" she wrote.

The win solidifies Arizonas swing-state status after years of Republican control, and comes as Democrats suffered a series of setbacks in their hopes of taking control of the Senate. They flipped one seat in Colorado, but lost another in Alabama and their big-money pushes aimed at unseating Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins in Maine both failed.

Although they held a seat in a tight race in Michigan, they're also trying to flip a seat where they're currently trailing in North Carolina and two seats in historically conservative Georgia, at least one of which is projected to head to a runoff on Jan. 5.

Kelly, in his first bid for public office, ran as a moderate who would be above the partisan bickering in Washington.

McSally was appointed to the seat in 2018 after the death of John McCain. Tuesday was a special election for the last two years of McCains term  the winner on Tuesday will have to run for re-election in two years  and was viewed as a must-win for Democrats' Senate hopes.

McSally trailed Kelly in the polls throughout the race and raised significantly less money.

McSally, a former Air Force pilot who opposed Donald Trump in 2016, found herself in a difficult position trying to hold on to the presidents base supporters while also appealing to moderates who would decide the election. McSally campaigned on multiple occasions with Trump and did little to distance herself from his administration.

Trump also created unique problems for McSally in Arizona because of his unpopularity with older voters, suburban voters and Mormons, key voting groups in the state. The Republican Partys relative stability among some Hispanic voters also did not benefit McSally quite as much in Arizona, where most of the fast-growing Hispanic population is Mexican American, a group that tends to be less conservative than Cuban Americans.

McSally argued that despite Kellys independent rhetoric, he would vote to advance a liberal agenda if he were elected, echoing an attack Trump frequently used against Joe Biden and calling him counterfeit Kelly.

Kelly repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would vote for Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, to be majority leader if the party takes control of the Senate, and refused to stake out a position on whether he would vote to eliminate the filibuster.

In his tweets Wednesday, Kelly said, ""I am preparing for the job of being an independent voice for all Arizonans, regardless of who they voted for.""",nam

328,"The Use of Offensive Tactics to Stop Fraud

Criminals engage organizations that manage customers assets in a battle of wits: They exploit technological and human weaknesses to commit financial crimes and fraud, leaving the organization and its customers holding the bag. A holistic approach to fraud protection should consider both offensive and defensive measures to combat criminals and fraud schemes. In part one of this two-part blog, we will explore the use of offensive tactics to stop fraud at the source.

Offense: Going for the Source of Fraudulent Transactions

The best way for a criminal to initiate a fraudulent transaction is in the shadow of a legitimate customer. This could be accomplished via a malware infection on a device that a legitimate customer uses to conduct business, a form filled with the victims stolen personal information or a phone call into an unsuspecting call center rep with the correct answers to security questions.

Seeing Fraud Coming Is Hard, but Preventing It from Taking Hold Is Harder

This is a pivotal moment in a fraud scheme. Preventing criminals from getting the fraud off the ground will reduce the amount of work needed to defend against fraud down the road. Delay would involve finding and verifying a fraudulent transaction among numerous genuine transactions.

Fraud protection at the source isnt trivial because it is hard to consider all the possible ways in which fraudulent transactions can be created. It is even more difficult to extend the reach of the organizations security measures in such a way that they can be present at the source of fraud. Thus, knowing a fraudulent transaction is coming is the next best thing.

Cyber Protection Is Key to Stopping Fraud at the Source

Customers can choose from many ways to engage the enterprise. The convenience and speed of online and mobile customer engagement channels has shifted a significant portion of offline customer activity to these channels. Also note the rapid adoption of online and mobile banking over the past few years.

With ease of use and convenience comes higher fraud risk, enabled by malware and phishing. These threats enable criminals to collect credentials and personal information and to operate undetected from customer devices. This data is used by criminals to operate in the shadow of the user when transacting across all channels.

Frustrate the Fraudsters by Making Fraud a Costly Endeavor

The organization can stop criminals from getting this valuable data by using a set of offensive measures, including malware and phishing protection, account takeover detection and more. Offense forces fraudsters to go back to the drawing board and change their tactics. This is costly and has real implications for their productivity. That said, offensive measures require up-to-date intelligence of criminal plans and tools. This evolving intelligence is essential to match their shifting tactics.

Fraud Protection: An Ounce of Offense Can Save You a Pound of Defense

Offense is a way to wreak havoc among cyber criminals. It reduces effective attack surface area and creates an early barrier that stops the attack before it reaches the enterprise back office. However, offense comes at a cost and requires highly flexible, intelligence-driven operations that can closely match criminals evasive maneuvers.

To create a truly holistic approach to fraud protection, strong offense must be complemented by effective defense. We will cover this in part two of this blog.",nam
329,"Juan Zarate, a former Treasury official and now adviser to Coinbase, writes in his book Treasurys War that financial warfarehas started to form a central part of international security strategies. By understanding the financial networks underpinning drug cartels, terrorist organizations and rogue nations, U.S. law enforcement and the Treasury Department have been able to pursue more sophisticated strategies aimed at disrupting them.

As a result of the widespread adoption of this approach, both in the U.S. and abroad, financial institutions around the world are held to higher standards than ever before with regard to detecting, reporting and mitigating financial crime. This is viewed by many businesses as a burdensome and costly task. Complaints about Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls in particular are common. Fintech companies, however, ought to recognize an opportunity to seize a competitive advantage.

Banks are generally weak with regard to financial crimes compliance, including AML/KYC controls and related operations such as information security and fraud prevention. The Department of Justice, for example, recently stated that the controls at HSBC were so bad that revealing them could potentially cause  serious criminal activity. Some went so far as to question whether HSBC is so large and complex that it is inherently impossible to govern.

In an unrelated piece about the ongoing sanctions compliance issues at Standard Chartered, the Financial Times highlighted two major causes of the banks headaches: a culture of disdain for American banking regulations and poor technology. Cultural and technological failures are industry-wide characteristics in banking, and they present a ripe target for fintech to gain an advantage.

Financial crime prevention can broadly be said to consist of three parts: reporting, intelligence and enforcement. Enforcement is, and always will fall under, the purview of governmental agencies and thus should only interest businesses tangentially. Intelligence and reporting, however, are naturally interrelated functions and give rise to business concerns due to regulatory requirements. Without a sound idea of what activity merits reporting, many institutions blindly generate tens of thousands of reports annually, several of which are very low-quality and of little use to law enforcement.

A recent discussion of flaws in the United Kingdoms AML laws pointed out that in that country, more than 350,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were filed in a year, resulting in law enforcement agencies being overwhelmed. This shotgun approach significantly reduces the value of reports in terms of mitigating risk to the institution, and often requires the mass hiring of expensive and often ineffective workers.

There are several reasons to think that fintech as an industry can and should do better. To begin with, regulators are beginning to pay more attention to their products and practices. John A. Cassara, a former Treasury Special Agent, recently wrote an excellent piece praising measures by the small African nation of Lesotho to regulate mobile payments and calling for the same in Western countries.

Innovative products in the financial space will ultimately run into regulators, and fintech companies need to be prepared for it. As Matt Levine wrote, Tech is an industry of moving fast and breaking things. Finance is an industry of moving fast, breaking things, being mired in years of litigation, paying 10-digit fines, and ruefully promising to move slower and break fewer things in the future.

But preparation aside, there are even greater advantages to be had by winning in this area. Fintech firms are technologically equipped to understand the activity occurring through their products in a way that banks simply are not, and thus they are better positioned to provide law enforcement with useful intelligence as opposed to scattershot reporting.

Aside from the usual advantages of pleasing regulators, behaving this way will squeeze traditional financial institutions on two fronts. First, it will drive standards in the industry, forcing them to invest more dumb money in areas where they are already grossly inefficient. Second, it will leave fintech businesses less exposed to the record-setting fines that are hamstringing banks. Driving these two costs will further decrease margins in vulnerable aspects of banks businesses. This will ultimately provide an opportunity for fintech firms to obtain another competitive advantage over traditional financial firms.",nam
330,"If you thought Googles Prediction API was just a handy tool for web programmers and weekend hackers, think again. A Folsom, Calif.-based startup called Pondera Solutions is pushing what it calls Fraud Detection as a Service, which is based on a variety of Google (s goog) services, including the Prediction API machine learning tool.

Pondera has actually been offering its service since November 2011, but this is the first Ive heard of it. I spotted it in a Wednesday-morning Google Enterprise blog post announcing that the Iowa Workforce Development agency has selected Pondera to power its unemployment-fraud detection efforts. The agencys system for analyzing unemployment claims highlights a portion of the Google services Pondera uses:

With FDaaS, suspicious claims are proactively flagged by the system, which alerts IWD employees about potentially fraudulent claims. The claims are plotted on a heatmap built on Google Maps to identify areas with the highest fraud incidents and determine where to put more investigative resources. We also use Google Street View to check the validity of businesses that submit claims.

Ponderas website lays out the rest:

Googles data centers, where FDaaS runs, which allow for immense scalability without the need to purchase on-premise hardware or software. Because FDaaS is in the cloud, unexpected spikes in UI claims can be handled without system failure or processing time lags.
Googles Prediction API, which trains, tunes and updates prediction models that check individual claims for anomalies or suspicious activities. Google prediction technologies discover and report trends, patterns, clusters, and other variables.
Google Big Query, which mines large amounts of transaction data to uncover previously undetected patterns and trends.
Google App Engine, which identifies factors such as UI claimants who have been rehired, those who may be using a fraudulent identity, and computers that have been previously used in fraudulent claims.
Google Search Appliance (GSA), which aids investigation of potential fraud or improper payments across both structured and unstructured data. Analysts and investigators can research cases using the GSAs intuitive, familiar Google search box.

Actually, this isnt the first time Googles Prediction API has been publicly cited as the basis for some real-world work. In 2011, Ford Motor Co. discussed how it was using the service to predict drivers behavior based on the data that cars sensors have captured in the past.",nam

(Persian: ??? ???????, Standard Persian pronunciation: (listen); born Hassan Fereydoun (Persian: ??? ?????? [7] [8] is an Iranian politician serving as the seventh and current President of Iran since 3 August 2013. He was also a lawyer, [9] academic, former diplomat and Islamic cleric. He has been a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts since 1999, [10] member of the Expediency Council since 1991, [11] and a member of the Supreme National Security Council since 1989. [6] [12] Rouhani was deputy speaker of the fourth and fifth terms of the Parliament of Iran (Majlis) and Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council from 1989 to 2005. [6] In the latter capacity, he was the country's top negotiator with the EU three, UK, France, and Germany, on nuclear technology in Iran, and has also served as a Shia mujtahid (a senior cleric), [13] and economic trade negotiator. [14] [15]:138 He has expressed official support for upholding the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. [16] In 2013, he appointed former industries minister Eshaq Jahangiri as his first vice-president. [17]

On 7 May 2013, Rouhani registered for the presidential election that was held on 14 June 2013. [18] He said that, if elected, he would prepare a ""civil rights charter"", restore the economy and improve rocky relations with Western nations. [19] [20] Rouhani is frequently described as a moderate. He was elected as President of Iran on 15 June, defeating Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and four other candidates. [21] [22] [23] He took office on 3 August 2013. [24] In 2013, Time magazine named him in its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In domestic policy, he encourages personal freedom and free access to information, has improved women's rights by appointing female foreign ministry spokespeople, and has been described as a centrist and reformist who has improved Iran's diplomatic relations with other countries through exchanging conciliatory letters. [25] [26] [27] Rouhani won re-election in the 2017 election with 23,636,652 votes (57.1%). [28] He became the third Iranian President, after Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to win a presidential victory as an incumbent with an increased electoral mandate.

Name[ edit ]

He was born Hassan Fereydoun (or Fereydun, in reference to a just king in Persian mythology, Persian: ???? ???????, Persian pronunciation: [hæ?sæn-e fe?ej?dun]) and later changed his last name to Rouhani, which means 'spiritual' or 'cleric'; [29] also transliterated as Rowhani, Ruhani, or Rohani). It is not clear when he officially changed his last name. He was named as ""Hassan Fereydoun Rouhani"" (Persian: ??? ?????? ???????) in a list of Majlis representatives on 5 July 1981, [30] while photos of his identification card (in Persian transliteration: shenasnameh) taken around his presidential campaign in 2013 only say ""Rouhani"" is his last name. [8]

Early life and education[ edit ]

Hassan Rouhani (born Hassan Fereydoun) was born on 12 November 1948 [8] in Sorkheh, near Semnan, into a religious Persian family. [31] His father, Haj Asadollah Fereydoun (died 2011), [32] had a spice shop in Sorkheh [33] and his mother lived in Semnan until her death in 2015 with her daughters and sons-in-law. [8] [34] Asadollah Fereydoun is reported to have been politically active against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, and arrested first in 1962, and then more than twenty times before the Iranian Revolution in 1979. [35]

Rouhani started religious studies in 1960, first at Semnan Seminary [9]:55 before moving on to the Qom Seminary in 1961. [9]:76 He attended classes taught by prominent scholars of that time including Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, Morteza Haeri Yazdi, Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, Soltani, Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, and Mohammad Shahabadi. [9]:81 In addition, he studied modern courses, and was admitted to the University of Tehran in 1969, and obtained a BA degree in Judicial Law in 1972. [6] [9]:309312 In 1973, Rouhani entered military service in the city of Nishapur. [36]

Rouhani continued his studies at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, graduating in 1995 with an M.Phil. degree in Law with his thesis entitled The Islamic legislative power with reference to the Iranian experience and a PhD degree in Constitutional Law in 1999 for a thesis titled The Flexibility of Shariah (Islamic Law) with reference to the Iranian experience. [37] [38] Rouhani's Caledonian research was initially supervised by Iranian lawyer and scholar Professor Sayed Hassan Amin and later by Islamic law scholar Dr Mahdi Zahraa. [39]

The website of the Center for Strategic Research, a think-tank headed by Rouhani, misattributed his PhD to Glasgow University rather than Glasgow Caledonian University and confusion ensued as a result on whether he was a graduate of either university, especially as he was known during his student years by his birth name ""Hassan Fereydoun"". [40] Glasgow Caledonian University carried out an internal investigation to confirm Rouhani's alumnus status and after confirming it, it published Rouhani's theses abstracts and a video showing him being capped, as Scottish academic tradition provides, during the University's 1999 graduation ceremony. [41] [42]

Main article: Hassan Rouhani plagiarism allegations

Allegations regarding Rouhani's plagiarism were first raised in 2013 when it was claimed that he had probably ""lifted"" sentences from a book by Afghan author Mohammad Hashim Kamali. Glasgow Caledonian University, Rouhani's graduation school, argued that the sentences were both cited properly. The issue was raised again amid 2017 Iranian presidential election when a student campaign claimed that they had for the first time investigated Rouhani's whole thesis using plagiarism detection tool iThenticate and that chapters one through four of Rouhani's thesis had been plagiarized at least 39%, 43%, 40% and 82%, respectively. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Kalantari, a member of the Assembly of Experts, Shiraz University faculty member and one of the alleged victims, said that ""major segments"" of Chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis had been translated from his book without being referenced. [43]

Reformist Sadegh Zibakalam accused Rouhani's rival of politicizing the case right before the elections. Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, head of Iranian Parliament 's Commission on Education and Research, said that he had found major plagiarisms in chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis and that the case would be investigated in Education and Research Commission. [43] 50 student-run organizations [44] as well as Shiraz University faculty professors asked Ali Akbar Kalantari to prosecute the case in separate letters. [45]

As a young cleric, Hassan Rouhani started his political activities by following the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the beginning of the Iranian Islamist movement. In 1965, he began traveling throughout Iran making speeches against the government of the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (king) of Iran. During those years he was arrested many times and was banned from delivering public speeches. [9]:232

In November 1977, during a public ceremony held at Tehran's Ark Mosque to commemorate the death of Mostafa Khomeini (the elder son of the Ayatollah Khomeini), Rouhani used the title ""Imam"" for the Ayatollah Khomeini, the then exiled leader of the Islamist movement, for the first time. [9]:375 [31] It has been suggested that the title has been used for Khomeini by others before, including by the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, although Rouhani was influential in publicizing the title. [46] [47] [48]

Since he was under surveillance by SAVAK (Iran's pre-revolution intelligence agency), the Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti and the Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari advised him to leave the country. [9]:385

Outside Iran he made public speeches to Iranian students studying abroad and joined Khomeini upon arriving in France. [9]:410

Political career during the 1980s and 1990s[ edit ]

Early years of Islamic Republic[ edit ]

Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Rouhani, who had been engaged in revolutionary struggles for about two decades, did his best to stabilize the nascent Islamic Republic and as a first step, he started with organizing the disorderly Iranian army and military bases. [9]:515 He was elected to the Majlis, the Parliament of Iran, in 1980. During five terms in the Majlis and for a total of 20 years (from 1980 to 2000), he served in various capacities including deputy speaker of the Majlis (in 4th and 5th terms), as well as the head of defense committee (1st and 2nd terms), and foreign policy committee (4th and 5th terms). [31]

Among responsibilities shouldered by him in the post-revolution era was leadership of the supervisory council of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) from 1980 to 1983. [6] In July 1983, while Rouhani was heading the council, the council members and Rouhani had conflicts [49] with Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani the then head of IRIB, which led to temporary replacement of Hashemi by first Rouhani and then immediately Mohammad Javad Larijani. [50] The conflict was resolved by the Ayatollah Khomeini intervening and insisting on Rafsanjani staying as the head of IRIB. [51]

IranIraq War[ edit ]

Main article: IranIraq War

During the IranIraq War, Rouhani was a member of the Supreme Defense Council (19821988), member of the High Council for Supporting War and headed its Executive Committee (19861988), deputy commander of the war (19831985), commander of the Khatam-ol-Anbiya Operation Center (19851988), and commander of the Iran Air Defense Force (19861991). [6] He was appointed as Deputy to Second-in-Command of Iran's Joint Chiefs of Staff (19881989). [6]

When Robert C. McFarlane, Reagan's national security adviser, came to Tehran in May 1986, Rouhani was one of the three people who talked to McFarlane about buying weapons. Eventually, this weapons sale became known as the IranContra affair. [52] [53]

At the end of the war, Hassan Rouhani was awarded the second-grade Fath (Victory) Medal along with a group of commanders of the Iranian Army and the Revolutionary Guards. In another ceremony on the occasion of the liberation of Khoramshahr, he and a group of other officials and military commanders who were involved in the war with Iraq were awarded first-grade Nasr Medal by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Ayatollah Khamenei.

Rouhani was offered and turned down the post of Minister of Intelligence of Iran in 1989. [54]

After the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was amended and the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) came into being up to the present time, he has been representative of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, at the council. [6] Rouhani was the first secretary of the SNSC and kept the post for 16 years from 1989 to 2005. He was also national security advisor  to President Hashemi and President Khatami  for 13 years from 1989 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2005. [6] In 1991, Rouhani was appointed to the Expediency Council and has kept that post up to the present time. He heads the Political, Defense, and Security Committee of the Expediency Council. [6]

After the Iran student protests, July 1999 he, as secretary of Supreme National Security Council, stated in a pro-government rally that ""At dusk yesterday we received a decisive revolutionary order to crush mercilessly and monumentally any move of these opportunist elements wherever it may occur. From today our people shall witness how in the arena our law enforcement force . . . shall deal with these opportunists and riotous elements, if they simply dare to show their faces."" [55] and led the crackdown. [56]

In the midterm elections for the third term of the Assembly of Experts which was held on 18 February 2000, Rouhani was elected to the Assembly of Experts from Semnan Province. He was elected as Tehran Province 's representative to the Assembly's fourth term in 2006 and is still serving in that capacity. He was the head of the political and social committee of the assembly of experts (from 2001 to 2006), member of the presiding board, and head of Tehran office of the secretariat of the assembly (from 2006 to 2008). On 5 March 2013, he was elected as a member of the Assembly's ""Commission for investigating ways of protecting and guarding Velayat-e Faqih"". [57]

In addition to executive posts, Rouhani kept up his academic activities. From 1995 to 1999, he was a member of the board of trustees of Tehran Universities and North Region. Rouhani has been running the Center for Strategic Research since 1991. He is the managing editor of three academic and research quarterlies in Persian and English, which include Rahbord (Strategy), Foreign Relations, and the Iranian Review of Foreign Affairs.

Hassan Rouhani, 29 January 2005

Rouhani was secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for 16 years. His leading role in the nuclear negotiations which brought him the nickname of ""Diplomat Sheikh"", first given to him by the nascent Sharq newspaper in November 2003 and was frequently repeated after that by domestic and foreign Persian-speaking media. His career at the Council began under President Hashemi Rafsanjani and continued under his successor, President Khatami. Heinonen, former senior IAEA official, said that Rouhani used to boast of how he had used talks with Western powers to ""buy time to advance Iran's programme."" [58] His term as Iran's top nuclear negotiator, however, was limited to 678 days (from 6 October 2003 to 15 August 2005). That period began with international revelations about Iran's nuclear energy program and adoption of a strongly worded resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In June 2004, the board of governors of the IAEA issued a statement which was followed by a resolution in September of the same year, which focused on Iran's nuclear case with the goal of imposing difficult commitments on Iran. That development was concurrent with the victory of the United States in Iraq war and escalation of war rhetoric in the region. The international community was experiencing unprecedented tensions as a result of which Iran's nuclear advances were considered with high sensitivity. [15]:120126

As tensions increased and in view of the existing differences between Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Atomic Energy Organization, a proposal was put forth by the foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, which was accepted by the president and other Iranian leaders. According to that proposal, a decision was made to establish a politically, legally, and technically efficient nuclear team with Hassan Rouhani in charge. The team was delegated with special powers in order to formulate a comprehensive plan for Iran's interactions with the IAEA and coordination among various concerned organizations inside the country. Therefore, on the order of President Khatami with the confirmation of Ali Khamenei, Hassan Rouhani took charge of Iran's nuclear case on 6 October 2003. [15]:138140 Subsequently, negotiations between Iran and three European states started at Saadabad in Tehran and continued in later months in Brussels, Geneva and Paris.

Rouhani and his team, whose members had been introduced by Velayati and Kharazi as the best diplomats in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, [15]:109,141 based their efforts on dialogue and confidence building due to political and security conditions. As a first step, they prevented further escalation of accusations against Iran in order to prevent reporting Iran's nuclear case to the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, and for the purpose of confidence building, certain parts of Iran's nuclear activities were voluntarily suspended at several junctures.

In addition to building confidence, insisting on Iran's rights, reducing international pressures and the possibility of war, and preventing Iran's case from being reported to the UN Security Council, Iran succeeded in completing its nuclear fuel cycle and took groundbreaking steps. [15]:660667 However, decisions made by the nuclear team under the leadership of Rouhani were criticized by certain circles in later years. [59] [60]

Following the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, Rouhani resigned his post as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council after 16 years on 15 August 2005, [15]:594,601 and was succeeded by Ali Larijani as the new secretary who also took charge of Iran's nuclear case. Larijani, likewise, could not get along with the policies of the new government and resigned his post on 20 October 2007, to be replaced by Saeed Jalili. Rouhani then was appointed by the Supreme Leader as his representative at the SNSC. [61]

Rouhani was considered a leading candidate in the June election because of his centrist views yet close ties to Iran's ruling clerics and the Green Movement. [63] He announced his presidential candidacy on 11 March 2013 and registered as a presidential candidate on 7 May. Amid the run-up to the election, former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, together with reformists supported Rouhani on the presidential race after pro-reform candidate Mohammad Reza Aref dropped out of the presidential race after Khatami advised him to quit in favor of Rouhani. [64] On 10 June, Mehr news agency and Fars news agency, suggested that Rouhani might be disqualified prior to the election [65] and The Washington Post, in an editorial, predicted that Rouhani ""will not be allowed to win"". [66] On 15 June 2013, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar announced the results of the election, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes, while his main rival Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf secured 6,077,292 votes. [67] [68] Rouhani performed well with both the middle class and youth, even garnering majority support in religious cities such as Mashhad and Qom (an important seat of Shia Islam and the clergy, many of whom surprisingly do not support conservatives) [69] as well as small towns and villages. [21] Rouhani's electoral landslide victory was widely seen as the result of the Green Movement from the 2009 elections, with crowds chanting pro-reform slogans. Religious Iranians equally celebrated Rouhani's victory, demonstrating what analysts described as a thorough rejection of the policies of the conservative factions. [21]

Rouhani saw off a strong challenge from hardline Ebrahim Raisi at the 2017 election, a fellow cleric with radically different politics, who stirred up populist concerns about the sluggish economy, lambasted Rouhani for seeking foreign investment and appealed to religious conservatives. He had gathered momentum as conservatives keen to win back control of the government coalesced behind Raisi's initially lacklustre campaign. His other rivals were Mostafa Mir-Salim and Mostafa Hashemitaba.

Rouhani ultimately won the election in a landslide, providing a ringing endorsement of his efforts to re-engage with the West and offer greater freedoms. [70] He received 23,636,652 of the votes, [28] in an election that had 73.07% turnout.

In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world. He promised greater openness and to repair the country's international standing, offering greater nuclear transparency in order to restore international trust. [71] Revolutionary Guards Major General Mohammad Jafari criticised Rouhani's administration. ""The military, systems and procedures governing the administrative system of the country are the same as before, [but it] has been slightly modified and unfortunately infected by Western doctrine, and a fundamental change must occur. The main threat to the revolution is in the political arena and the Guards cannot remain silent in the face of that."" In May 2017, Rouhani was re-elected as President with 23.5 million votes. [72]

Rouhani announced his cabinet on 4 August. He had a ten-day mandate for introducing his cabinet members to the parliament but he did not use this. Then, parliament voted on his cabinet, which was scheduled on 1419 August. Between three reformist politicians (Mohammad Reza Aref, Eshaq Jahangiri or Mohammad Shariatmadari) that were likely for the vice presidency, Rouhani appointed Jahangiri for the position. There were also many candidates for the ministry of foreign affairs: Ali Akbar Salehi, Kamal Kharazi, Sadegh Kharazi, Mohammad Javad Zarif and Mahmoud Vaezi but Zarif became Rouhani's final nominee. [74] Although several names were being circulated for the other ministerial posts before the final announcement, the office of president-elect denied these speculations. On 23 July 2013, it was reported that eight members of Rouhani's cabinet had been finalized: Jahangiri as first vice president, Zarif as foreign minister, Rahmani Fazli as interior minister, Tayebnia as finance minister, Dehghan as defense minister, Namdar Zanganeh as petroleum minister, Najafi as education minister, Chitchian as energy minister, Nematzadeh as industries minister, Hassan Hashemi as health minister and Akhondi as transportation minister. [75] This become official after Rouhani presented the list of his ministry nominates to the parliament on his inauguration day. He also appointed Mohammad Nahavandian as his chief of staff.

The economic policy of Hassan Rouhani focuses on the long-term economic development of Iran. It deals with increasing the purchasing power of the public, economic growth, raising sufficient funds, implementation of the general policies of 44th Principle of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran and improving the business environment in the short term. [76] Rouhani believes that improving the economic conditions of the people should be accomplished by boosting the purchasing power of the people, reducing the wealth gap. He also thinks that equitable distribution of national wealth and economic growth lead to all mentioned economic goals. He states that if national wealth was not created, poverty would be distributed. National wealth creation causes an increase in real income per capita and equitable distribution of wealth. His plan is targeted to increase direct and indirect assistance to low-income groups. [77]

Rouhani is urgently going to regenerate the Management and Planning Organization of Iran. His economic policies also comprise optimal distribution of subsidies, control of liquidity and inflation, speeding economic growth and reducing import. He believes that inflation results in damaging effects on the economy of families and hopes to deflate that in Foresight and Hope Cabinet. [78]

Rouhani plans urgent economic priorities such as control of high inflation, increasing purchasing power and cutting down high unemployment. [79]

According to a March 2014 report by Center for International Media Assistance, since Rouhani takeover in 2013, ""Censorship of the Internet has only gotten worse, but it's more and more clear that Rouhani does not have complete control over this process"". [80]

Regarding internet censorship, he has stated: ""Gone are the days when a wall could be built around the country. Today there are no more walls."" He has also criticized Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting for showing trivial foreign news, while ignoring pressing national matters. [81] Rouhani also appeared to pledge his support for increasing Internet access and other political and social freedoms. In an interview, he said: ""We want the people, in their private lives, to be completely free, and in todays world having access to information and the right of free dialogue, and the right to think freely, is the right of all peoples, including the people of Iran."" [82]

Human and women's rights[ edit ]

See also: Human rights in Iran

Rouhani has maintained a policy of not publicly addressing human rights issues, on which he may have limited powers. [83]

Rouhani is a supporter of women's rights. In a speech after he was elected as the President of Iran, he said:

There must be equal opportunities for women. There is no difference between man and woman in their creation, in their humanity, in their pursuit of knowledge, in their understanding, in their intelligence, in their religious piety, in serving God and in serving people. [84]

Rouhani's government appointed Elham Aminzadeh, Shahindokht Molaverdi and Masoumeh Ebtekar as vice presidents; as well as Marzieh Afkham, the first female spokesperson for the foreign ministry. Rouhani has promised to set up a ministry for women. Many women's rights activists, however, are reluctant about a ministry for women; because they feel that this ministry may isolate women's issues. It has also been suggested that Rouhani will require a deputy minister position within each ministry to address gender issues and issues pertaining to women. [85]

In September 2013, eleven political prisoners were freed including noted human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh. The move came just days before his visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly. [86]

Critics say that little has changed in domestic policy since Rouhani took office. Iranian authorities executed 599 people during Rouhani's first 14 months in power, compared with 596 during the last year in office of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran has the highest number of executions anywhere in the world, apart from China. [87] Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has criticized Rouhani's human rights record. She cited the increase in executions, Abdolfattah Soltani 's hunger strike, and the continued house arrest of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi. An Iranian spokesperson said Ebadi's comments would end up provoking animosity towards Iran. [88] [89] [90]

In 2015, Rouhani appointed Marzieh Afkham and Saleh Adibi, as the first female since the 1979 (the second in history) and the first Sunni Kurd respectively, to hold office as ambassadors. [91] [92]

Rouhani's foreign policy has been contained by the conservatism of Iranian Principlists, who fear change, while also realizing it is necessary. Furthermore, Iran's foreign policy, which was deadlocked by the efforts of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, needs new predecessor by cautious and decisive efforts of Rouhani. [ clarification needed ] The main task of Rouhani is only to develop dialogues between Iran and Political rivals including P5+1. This course can help lift sanctions that damaged the Iranian economy. [93]

In March 2015, Rouhani sent a letter to President Obama and the heads of the other five countries negotiating with Iran, explaining Iran's stance. He announced it on his Twitter account. The US National Security Council confirmed that the letter had been passed on to the U.S. negotiating team, but its contents were not released. Rouhani also spoke by phone with the leaders of all the nations involved in the negotiations, except for the United States. [94]

Rouhani's visit to New York City in September 2013 was hailed [ who? ] as major progress in Iran's relations with the United States. He previously said that his government is ready to hold talks with the United States after thirty-two years. Rouhani denied reports that during his trip he had refused a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, [98] and felt more time was needed to coordinate such a meeting. [98] On 27 September 2013, a day after the two countries foreign ministers met during the P5+1 and Iran talks, Rouhani had a phone call with President Obama that marked two countries' highest political exchange since 1979.

On Iran's relationship to Saudi Arabia, Rouhani wrote that during the Khatami administration, he, as the secretary-general of the National Security Council at that time, reached ""a comprehensive and strategic agreement"" with the Saudis, but that this agreement was not upheld during the Ahmadinejad's government. Specifically, while discussing the episode, he stated:

there was a consensus [during Khatami's administration] that we should have good relations with Saudi Arabia. No one within the nezaam [regime] was opposed to it. I went to Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1998. At that time Saudi Arabia had accused us of involvement in the Khobar Towers bombing. I went to Saudi Arabia as the secretary-general of the SNSC. From their side, [Minister of Interior] Nayef bin Abdulaziz took part in the negotiations. The negotiations began at 10 p.m. and lasted until 5 a.m. the next morning.

332,"(CNN) The Trump campaign and President Donald Trump peppered Thursday with tweets and news conferences boasting of success in courts as states continue to count ballots, but the legal efforts repeatedly failed to gain traction or affect significant enough numbers of votes, if any, in key states.

Several of the active cases centered on Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, specifically, where vote counters throughout the day continued to tally numbers of absentee ballots that cut Trump's lead in the state dramatically.

Trump's few wins in court have largely been on procedural measures on issues that could affect minuscule numbers of ballots, or like in one Pennsylvania case, about relatively inconsequential issues such as allowing campaign canvass observers to stand slightly closer to ballot processers. In several courts in recent days, judges have been exasperated with the Trump campaign and Republicans' arguments.

In one case the Trump campaign filed in federal court on Thursday in Pennsylvania, Judge Paul Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, set a tone almost immediately with sarcasm, telling the Trump campaign lawyer, ""Well, you have your hearing.""

By the end of the hearing, the Trump campaign lawyer had admitted, contrary to his initial complaint, that observers for the campaign were in the room to watch ballot canvassing in Philadelphia.

The judge asked Philadelphia city officials to confirm Democrats and Republicans were being treated fairly to watch the ballot-counting and that they were allowed to watch the counting in the city from 6 feet away. He noted the case appeared to be an appeal of a state issue -- making it completely out of place for a federal court to handle.

When the Trump campaign lawyer spoke up to say he had ""another problem"" with the ballot observation, Diamond, the judge, cut him off, asking, ""Length and width? Time and place?""

When the judge pressed the Trump campaign lawyer on if there were observers in the room from the campaign, the lawyer, Jerome Marcus, said: ""There's a non-zero number of people in the room.""

At another point, when Marcus handed the judge a hand-drawn map of the ballot counting room, Diamond cracked that the lawyer should keep his day job.

It wasn't the first sketch of a map introduced this week. In a Nevada Supreme Court case filed on Election Day, lawyers representing the Trump campaign similarly submitted a hand-drawn map of a ballot processing room as evidence -- an unusual approach in any case.

Election lawsuits filed on Election Day often have some air of informality, given the need for quick action. But several election law experts have been critical of the lack of serious legal arguments that representatives of the Trump campaign are making in recent days -- with some court filings not even containing evidence or assertions of fact at all.

In other states where the vote was still close, judges dismissed new Trump or Republican cases quickly on Thursday.

Georgia Judge James F. Bass on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed a day earlier by state Republicans to prevent the ""unlawful counting of ballots received after the election"" in Savannah, after a poll watcher for the party allegedly viewed unprocessed absentee ballots mixed in with absentee ballots that were set to be tabulated.

And in Michigan, a state court judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Trump campaign that asked for an immediate halt to the vote counting until its representatives had ""meaningful"" access to ballot counting and adjudication.

Judge Cynthia Stephens was highly skeptical throughout the virtual hearing about the lack of admissible evidence in the case and whether the campaign had sued the right party, the secretary of state.

""What I have is, at best, a hearsay affidavit that addresses a harm that would be significant,"" said Stephens. ""We've got an affidavit that is not firsthand knowledge.""

She said she was not convinced the campaign's claims could succeed in court.",nam

334,"CCTV cameras scan the triage area, as women in brightly coloured fabric line up with their children. A painting on the wall shows a lady with a baby strapped on her back under the sign yu nor de pay no money. At the childrens clinic where I work, healthcare is free. This is something that is not taken for granted here. In Sierra Leone, as in many parts of the world, healthcare often comes with a catch.

Corruption in healthcare is a taboo subject, with both patients and staff often reluctant to admit its existence. But it does exist. And it extends from mismanagement at high levels of government to bribes and unauthorised charges for frontline services. It is widespread and under-reported and can have devastating consequences.

Sierra Leone in west Africa was at the epicentre of the recent Ebola crisis. A 2015 Transparency International survey reported an astonishing 84% of Sierra Leoneans had paid a bribe for government services. There is huge systemic corruption, up to a third of money given to fight Ebola remains unaccounted for. An internal government audit showed £11m was missing from the first six months of the outbreak alone.

Despite having rich natural resources, the majority of the population live in grinding poverty. The country has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality in the world with 1,360 mothers dying per 100,000 live births.

It was in an effort to tackle this horrifying statistic that the president, Ernest Bai Koroma, introduced the Free Health Care Initiative in 2010, specifically granting free care for under-fives and pregnant and lactating mothers. This was a bold and much needed move for which he should be applauded. However, in spite of this campaign there are widespread reports of charges for frontline services. A 2016 report by the Campaign for Human Rights and Development International describes rampant bribery throughout the healthcare system in Freetown.

There are stories of women being told that their babies will not be monitored in labour unless they give money to the nurse in charge, unofficial payments being taken in order to triage or register patients and medications and medical equipment that should be free, being sold at a mark-up.

Many people are not even aware that the charges they are being asked to pay are unauthorised

Sierra Leone has an adult literacy rate of 40%. Many people are not empowered to stand up for their right to free healthcare, and are often not even aware that the charges they are being asked to pay are unauthorised. There is inevitably a fear of reporting corruption as people are afraid they may be victimised or excluded altogether next time they come.

But the government is trying to make changes to that culture. At the state run hospital in the centre of town there are now posters which proclaim pay no bribe, urging people to report any cases of bribery they may encounter. This new initiative organised by Sierra Leones Anti-Corruption Commission, and funded by the UK Department for International Development, allows people to call a toll-free number to report cases of corruption across the education, electricity, health, police, water and sanitation sectors. This innovation goes some way to putting some of the power back into the hands of the people using these services. In the last quarter of 2016, 23.2% of bribes reported on these hotlines were paid to healthcare officials.

The reasons for these difficulties in Sierra Leone are complex and multifaceted. Although the country has an acute shortage of healthcare personnel, qualified nurses are often made to work for years as volunteers. When they are actually paid, salaries for government nurses and doctors are shockingly low. This mix of a sick and needy population and underpaid medical staff makes tackling corruption more difficult. There is widespread corruption in government with funds misappropriated and misused  as was only too clearly illustrated during the Ebola crisis. This situation is replicated across healthcare sectors in many countries across the world.

Research shows that charges at the point of access to healthcare reduce a persons likelihood of seeking help and the seeking of bribes must surely act in the same way no matter how small. They lead to people delaying access to healthcare or not seeking it at all. For a woman living in one of the towns slums with a sick baby, the cost of transport to the healthcare facilities will make access almost impossible, and any charges on arrival will prohibit it all together. People being charged bribes are disempowered, if they refuse to pay they will be denied services. Government officials syphoning funds away from their intended uses are harming the vulnerable who they are there to serve.

Although corruption remains a significant problem in Sierra Leone, it is very little spoken about, so innovations like the pay no bribe campaign are a hugely important step. Recognising corruption and making it visible is a crucial first act. People may be reluctant to report corruption because of fears of retribution, so allowing anonymous reporting is a great innovation and a first step to empowering people, so long as it is followed up without fear or favour.

More is needed to tackle this deeply entrenched problem, better pay for nursing staff, tighter regulation of hospitals and scrutiny of healthcare budgets. The population need to be enabled to demand more effective services. Corruption in healthcare certainly comes as a result of poverty and inequality, but it only serves to drive both these things. Ultimately it is the sick children who are kept at home, and denied healthcare because of their carers fear of charges, who suffer.",am
335,"The director of the Alabama Securities Commission expects a new state law to make it easier to prosecute securities fraud cases that take years for the crime to emerge.

Gov. Robert Bentley signed legislation this week sponsored by Republican Rep. Paul DeMarco of Homewood that extends the statute of limitations for many crimes from three years to five years. They include theft of property, extortion and bribery.

Securities Commission Director Joe Borg said the new law also extends the statute of limitations for securities fraud and theft by deception to five years from when the fraud is discovered. The statute of limitations for theft by deception had been three years from when the crime occurred and securities fraud had been five years form when the deal occurred.

Borg said that during the recession, when interest rates on bank accounts dropped very law, some people, particularly senior citizens, put their money in long-term investments that didnt offer a return until five or six years later. By then, the statute of limitations had run out if any fraud was involved.

This is going to be a big deal for long-term investments, he said in a phone interview Tuesday night.

The bill received final passage in the Legislature on April 3, the last day of the 2014 session. It did not get a negative vote in either the House or the Senate.

It was one of two major bills the Securities Commission got passed at the end of the session. The other, which has also been signed by the governor, allows the use of crowd funding through social media to raise up to $1 million to start a small business.",nam
336,"The US faces a wide range of domestic challenges related to the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, which is Transparency Internationals definition of corruption.

Key issues include the influence of wealthy individuals over government; pay to play politics and the revolving doors between elected government office, for-profit companies, and professional associations; and the abuse of the US financial system by corrupt foreign kleptocrats and local elites.

The current US president was elected on a promise of cleaning up American politics and making government work better for those who feel their interests have been neglected by political elites.

Yet, rather than feeling better about progress in the fight against corruption over the past year, a clear majority of people in America now say that things have become worse. Nearly six in ten people now say that the level of corruption has risen in the past twelve months, up from around a third who said the same in January 2016.

A new survey by Transparency International, the US Corruption Barometer 2017, was carried out in October and November 2017. It shows that the US government and some key institutions of power still have a long way to go to win back citizens trust.

The results show:

44 per cent of Americans believe that corruption is pervasive in the White House, up from 36 per cent in 2016.
Almost 7 out of 10 people believe the government is failing to fight corruption, up from half in 2016.
Close to a third of African-Americans surveyed see the police as highly corrupt, compared to a fifth across the survey overall.
55 per cent gave fear of retaliation as the main reason not to report corruption, up from 31 per cent in 2016.
74 per cent said ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.",nam

Kim began his career as a floor manager and supervisor in North Koreas heavy industry sector. His first significant position was an assistant manager at the Taean Heavy Machinery Complex. He was appointed manager of Taean Heavy Machinery Complex in 2003 when the DPRK instituted its complex enterprise system in 2001. Kim was elected a deputy to the 11th SPA in 2003.

In 2008, Kim Tok Hun was removed from his factory managers position and did not hold any public positions, including elections to the 12th SPA in March 2009. There is a possibility he served as an advisor to Kim Jong Un after KJUs designation as hereditary successor in early 2009. Kim Tok Hun re-emerged in the public aspects of DPRK political culture in 2011 when he was appointed Chairman of the Chagang (Jagang) Peoples Provincial Committee.

Kim was elected a deputy to the 13th SPA in March 2014 and appointed DPRK Vice Premier. He was elected a member of the WPK Central Committee during the 7th Party Congress in May 2016. He was elected an alternate (candidate) member of the WPK Political Bureau and was returned to the SPA and reappointed DPRK Vice Premier during the opening session of the 14th SPA in April 2019.

During the December 2019 plenary session of the WPK Central Committee, Kim was upgraded to a full WPK Political Bureau member. He was also elected a KWP Vice Chairman on the Executive Policy Bureau (Council). Two months after his appointment, Kim Jong Un revealed a major abuse of power and corruption scandal within the cadres training apparatus during a Politburo meeting; Kim Tok Hun most likely learned of and reported this after his appointment.

On 13 August 2020, in an order issued by the State Affairs Commission [SAC] Kim Tok Hun was appointed DPRK Premier. At a Political Bureau meeting held later the same day, Kim was elected a Presidium (standing committee) Member of the Political Bureau.

340,"Ecommerce merchants love the holidays. So do fraudsters. Chargeback cheats and organized criminals know youre busy driving sales, fulfilling orders, and keeping customers happy. They hope you are not as vigilant in manually reviewing their orders.

To help reduce fraudulent purchases and chargebacks, it may be worth using a fraud prevention service.

What Is a Fraud Prevention Service?

A fraud prevention service is a company dedicated to identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions  i.e., ecommerce transactions  that will result in chargebacks and lost revenue. It helps catch organized account takeover attacks, purchases made from stolen credit cards, and the so-called friendly fraud chargeback cheaters, who purchase products using their own, legitimate credit card numbers but then fraudulently file a chargeback with the credit card company after receiving the goods.

A fraud prevention service is a company dedicated to identifying fraudulent card-not-present transactions  i.e., ecommerce transactions  that will result in chargebacks and lost revenue.

These services analyze an extensive amount of information from many sources to make an order approval recommendation. The analysis is typically much more thorough than what your card processor offers  address and security code verifications, usually. Best of all, it can integrate into your ecommerce platform and to make those recommendations quickly.

Fraud prevention services typically charge a percentage of your transaction value or a fixed fee that ranges from $80 to $1,000 per month, typically. To determine if a fraud prevention service makes financial sense to you, calculate your total fraud and chargeback costs and then add in the lost revenue from orders that you declined. Compare that overall total to the cost of the service.

Save Money and Time?

Chargebacks hurt your profits with the double impact of lost margin from unreturned product and additional fees from the bank. Then, MasterCard and Visa can charge additional amounts if chargebacks exceed 1 percent of your transactions. Plus, you have lost opportunity costs of your time when you fight chargebacks.

Prevention is the best approach. The address verification system (AVS) and CCV security code services from your merchant account provider or payment gateway are a start. However, solely relying on your merchant account provider to flag questionable orders is not enough. (For example, MerchantVoice columnist Erica Tevis, owner of Little Things Favors, an online gift boutique, recently explained the nine checks she uses to detect fraudulent orders, in How I detect ecommerce fraud.)

Still the bad guys have many tricks. They can spoof their location, use mobile devices, and respond to your email inquiries. They can even answer your phone calls. Its often complex and time consuming to manually cyber sleuth each risky order.

For many ecommerce businesses, therefore, a fraud prevention service is worth the money.

Fraud Prevention Services: Questions to Ask

Here are ten questions to ask to help you choose the right fraud prevention service for your ecommerce business.

What service plans do they offer? Vendors offer different plans to fit the level of control or involvement you want. Determine if you want to be completely hands off or if you want to define the rules. Consider vendors that can customize their rules engine to match your policies and risk tolerance.

What data is analyzed? An extensive number of data sources are available to help make a risk decision. How does the service incorporate IP geolocation, proxy detection, chargeback blacklists, social graphs, issuing-bank data, and address, phone, and email verifications? Find out what is being monitored and how frequently new data sources are added.

How is mobile data identified? Mobile sales are growing quickly. Fraud from mobile devices is on the rise as well. Sophisticated vendors can establish a buyers online fingerprint and determine activity patterns from of a buyers computer, smartphone, and other web access devices.

How are false positives reduced? Declining a good order also costs you profits and new customers. Its easy to make a policy that declines all transactions from certain countries, for example. However, a robust fraud detection service can help capture more sales by digging deeper and validating orders that you would otherwise cancel.

Do you have to approve or decline an order? Even with advanced fraud detection monitoring and analysis, the service provider may just make a recommendation or score the order. You may still have to make the final decision to accept or decline an order. Ask if they have any triggers or rules that can then be used to automatically cancel any bad orders and process all good orders.

Is it integrated with your shopping cart? You will want order data to pass seamlessly from your shopping cart into the fraud prevention systems. Ask the vendor what ecommerce platforms it works with. Most vendors support the most popular platforms. Then find out what you need to do to grant access permissions and if there is plugin installation or other coding required.

Are other order channels supported? Are there other credit-card-not-present transactions that you need to process, such as phone orders? Find out how the service supports all of your channels. What does it take to submit order data into the fraud analysis systems for offline channels? And if you also have a brick and mortar store, some vendors can augment your in-store fraud services.

What guarantees are offered? Some providers offer chargeback guarantees or insurance  i.e., if they approve a transaction that turns out bad, you are covered for some or all of your financial loses. However, if you are still making the final approval decision, it is likely that you may not qualify for compensation. So check the legal terms closely on any guarantees.

Dedicated support is available? Having a dedicated contact or, better yet, a direct fraud support team can be a big benefit to you. Vendors can improve their performance if they know more about your business. For example, the vendor can improve its fraud rules based on the products you sell, typical order values or quantities, or if you are targeting a new market. Plus, it is helpful to have someone to quickly call to discuss a questionable order.

What service level agreements are included? Speed is key when making decisions about orders, even risky ones. You dont want to sit on an order for too long. Understand a vendors commitment to quick communications and alerts, system up-time, performance during high volume times, and direct contact support.

There are many fraud prevention services that focus on helping ecommerce businesses. Here is a partial list, arranged in alphabetical order.",nam
341,"Globally migrant communities will send nearly US$435 billion to family members in home countries this year. These remittances are vital and sustain not only the livelihoods of the recipients, but also the economies of poor countries.

Recently Westpac, mirroring 2013 steps by Barclays in the UK, became the last big Australian bank to terminate its services to small remitters. This poses a serious risk to the continued, transparent flow of remittances.

Not all Westpac remitter accounts were closed as a group of remitters brought a [legal case](https://www.comcourts.gov.au/file/FEDERAL/P/NSD1222/2014/order_list#;javascript:void(0) against Westpac. This case as well as discussions between the newly organised Australian remittance industry, the banks and the Australian government continue. The lack of real and urgent action however threatens to increase terrorist financing risks.

Moving money  above or below board

Informal, ethnic remittance services  for example, in the form of hawala  are well-developed and often said to pre-date Western banking. These systems shift value across borders without moving physical money. The flow happens through a network of trusted agents, often involving cross-border trade and over and under-invoicing.

Informal remittance systems transfer funds cheaply and efficiently for honest customers. However, the lack of transparency and industry practices also expose them to abuse. Informal remittances are ideal for money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing.

Alongside informal services, formal providers channel money through the banking system. Formal remittance transactions are generally handled by large international companies like Western Union and Moneygram and a host of small service providers. These providers - generally small businesses with ties to ethnic communities - provide affordable and accessible services to ethnic migrant communities. To remit money through the formal financial system, remitters require bank accounts.

From 2001 governments decided to formalise these services and terminate informal remittances. Yet full regulation of remittance services was deemed challenging. Governments settled for basic registration of providers who were required to implement anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) measures.

The AML/CTF compliance burden soon proved too onerous for small remitters, while the registration processes were inadequate to weed out criminal elements and ensure the integrity of registered remitters.

Simultaneously the duty of banks to monitor their customers to prevent criminal transactions was increased, especially in relation to higher-risk customers. Regulators identified remittance businesses as higher-risk customers, thereby requiring banks to spend more money on monitoring their accounts than those of less risky customers. It soon became clear the costs of maintaining these accounts exceeded the income they could generate.

Further pressure was placed on remittance relationships when regulators began to impose superfines on banks for AML/CFT failures. Large international banks began to refuse to deal with smaller banks that could not prove they were adequately managing remittance risks. Targeted law-enforcement action against remitters provided evidence of serious criminal infiltration and collusion by some providers.

For many banks it just made compliance and business sense to exit the small remitter market, thereby undermining the formalisation policy objective.

What now?

Remitter account closures are occurring worldwide and regulators appear unable to prevent it. The most promising development to date was the establishment of a joint government and industry task group in the UK (the Action Group on Cross Border Remittances) to develop, among others, a safe UK-Somalia remittance corridor.

In general, however, regulators have merely called on banks not to engage in wholesale account closure, without taking any steps to change the rules that have led to this response. Given that money service business account closures started in the mid-2000s in the US, the lack of action is disappointing. Regulators have had 10 years to intervene. . The reality is that remittance flows will not stop. Immigrants who need to support vulnerable and often desperate family members abroad will continue to do so. They have no option.

If they cannot afford the more expensive services of the larger, formal providers, they will use informal channels or one of the myriad new online channels. Greater use of these channels will increase terrorist financing risks to society. In addition, the frustration and alienation experienced by members of such communities in Australia and abroad may translate into higher terror risks.

There are therefore compelling reasons to turn this situation around. What can be done?

1) Develop a holistic policy

The remittance debacle constitutes clear policy failure. Initial policy interventions were driven by security concerns. The sense of urgency in 2001 did not allow for sufficient fact-gathering and consultation. A holistic policy that aligns the national security, regulatory and international development goals of government is required.

Cross-border cooperation is also required. Money remitted from Australia is received elsewhere. When the recipient is in Somalia or another developing country where secure identification is not available, Australia will need to cooperate with foreign governments to limit criminal risks.

2) Regulate remittance services appropriately

The amount of money involved and the social impact of remittances demand appropriate regulation, including consumer protection. Governments recognised the need for regulation but were not prepared to do what it takes. They therefore restricted the regulatory focus to AML/CTF aspects only and burdened banks with an uncommercial, quasi-regulatory monitoring function.

This approach has clearly failed. The industry requires a regulator with a broad mandate, one that reflects and balances the interests of the broader industry, providers, customers and society. Industry self-regulation could assist in nurturing the industry but government must shoulder the weight of the regulatory responsibility.

3) Cap transactions by small remitters

The regulatory and supervisory frameworks can be proportionate if a risk-based approach is adopted. The most challenging entities to regulate are the small, independent remitters. One light-touch option is to provide a special minimal compliance regime enabling them to process a limited number of small remittance transactions.

For example, one could impose limits on individual transactions, with a total cap on the value of their monthly remittance business. Such caps are used successfully to reduce the risks posed by mobile money in developing countries. Correctly calibrated caps would align the risk of abuse with the compliance capacity of the business, while facilitating affordable remittance flows.

These are longer-term solutions. In the short term  counted in days and weeks  we need government action to secure banks that are still willing to engage these remitters. Its up to government to devise a scheme that can keep small remittances flowing  and terrorist financing risks contained  until a more appropriate framework is developed. Having created the regulatory conditions for account closures, it is insufficient to merely call on banks not to close these accounts.",nam
342,"In the last three months the RCMP has warned Canadians about telephone scams allegedly involving Revenue Canada and the Immigration departments demanding money from residents.

There are also ongoing ransomware stings (which cost victims $3.1 million last year) and attempts to trick business executives into wiring money to fraudsters (which cost victims just over $3 million last year).

In fact in 2015 authorities across the country received over 18,000 extortion-related complaints which cost 1,113 people over $3 million.

According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre the biggest dollar loss was suffered by 990 people who fell victim to what are called romance scams usually Internet dating  and lost over $16 million. That was followed by 268 victims of investment fraud ($8 million lost), extortion scams ($3.1 million), prizes ($7.1 million) and spear phishing ($6 million lost). Just over 5,700 residents fell for what the centre calls service scams, which include phoney online warnings and phone calls that a computer has been infected ($2.8 million lost).

Which is why this is a good time to remind CISOs that March is Fraud Prevention Month in Canada. And while its largely an annual consumer awareness project, enterprises of all size shouldnt forget they also have a role in being vigilant.

As part of the campaign KMPG Canada has released a guide to threat-related trends. These key trends are what were seeing in the Canadian market that organizations need to be aware of to protect themselves against cyber threats, including fraud-related threats, Kevvie Fowler, the consulting companys national cyber response leader, said in an interview. They include:

 Extortion-driven attacks and ransomware attempts will increase.

WHAT TO DO: First, know where valuable data is stored, Fowler said, then ensure IT has a safe data backup and recovery strategy that is tested. Second, limit access to sensitive data to privileged accounts.

Ransomware often spreads by email with malicious attachments, after which the attacker encrypts systems and then demands money to unlock the data, so keep up regular employee security awareness campaigns.

Fowler also notes theres a new ransomware strategy: A phone or email before an attack threatening to break into a corporate system unless money is paid in advance.

Organizations will face increasing pressure from govenrments, privacy commissioners, courts and consumers to be more transparent about their cyber security readiness and breach notification.

CISOs and privacy officers are still waiting for the federal government to put forward suggested regulations for the new Digital Privacy Act, passed last year, which will detail their obligations to notify customers and partners about breaches that pose a risk of significant harm.

WHAT DO TO: KPMG says organizations have to say on top of this ever-changing environment. Rules may vary not only from province to province, but also  for those operating internationally  by country.

 The continually increasing number of mobile and IoT devices means increasing risk. The number of mobile-related vulnerabilities continues to increase, and the lack of generally-accepted security standards for IoT devices doesnt help.

WHAT TO DO: Organizations that write their own software have to ensure developers follow good application security procedures to protect data and define who can use it, said Fowler.

At the other end enterprises have to restrict user access or warn employees of free mobile software  from flashlights to games  that often leak data or contains malware. Employees also have to be reminded to check the reputation of the software publisher before downloading any mobile apps.

Organizations will make greater use of real-time threat intelligence tools.

Improving threat detection is replacing prevention as a basic strategy. Adding behavioral analytics is increasingly important. But threat intelligence  either created internally or subscribed to  is also becoming part of a CISOs strategies to keep ahead of attacks.

WHAT TO DO: Its important for CISOs to identify what they want to get out of public or commercial threat intelligence before subscribing to a feed, Fowler said.

Understand what sensitive information you have, understand the security program you currently have in place, identify the areas where additional intelligence would be able to allow you to do a better job identifying, mitigating and responding to threats.

In addition to securing their enterprise CISOs will increasingly look at the risks posed by partners and suppliers  including cloud services.

Most readers already know that the 2014 breach of Target stores in the U.S. was accomplished by hacking a heating and ventilation supplier. Outside suppliers that link to enterprises are a known vulnerability that attackers will try to exploit.

WHAT TO DO: A full security audit which may include penetration testing or remote process monitoring can expose these gaps, says KPMG.

As part of Fraud Prevention Month there are a number of events. The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses is running an online Webinar today and Thursday on preventing fraud in small businesses starting at 1 p.m. Eastern. Theres a French version available on Wednesday.

Also today the Competition Bureau is hosting a Twitter chat as part of the annual Too Good to Be True Day to help Canadians understand how to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. The chat runs from noon to 1 p.m. Eastern with the hashtag #2G2BT.

The Financial Services Commission of Ontario is running a Twitterchat Wednesday from 1 to 2 pm Eastern to help residents recognize fraud. The hashtag is #Fraudchat. It will be repeated March 31.

The Better Business Bureau has declared March 15 password reset day to remind people to regularly change all their passwords for basic security. (And if you have trouble remembering all your passwords, use a password manager.)

343,"(CNN) The United Nations welcomes the decision by Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister to step down by the end of October, a UN statement released Thursday said.

The Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj, announced his decision in a televised speech on Wednesday.

""I declare my sincere desire to hand over my duties to the next executive authority no later than the end of October,"" al-Sarraj said, citing ""internal and external conspiracies"" and other obstacles to the effectiveness of his government.

Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General Stephanie Williams commended the decision in a statement, saying it ""comes at a decisive turning point in Libya's longstanding crisis when it is clear that the situation is no longer sustainable.""

""The onus is now on concerned Libyan parties to fully shoulder their responsibilities before the Libyan people, to take historic decisions, and to accept mutual concessions for the sake of their country,"" Williams said.

The GNA has often been at odds with General Khalifa Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and his administration, in the oil rich region in eastern Libya. The warlord has spearheaded a campaign to win control over the oil-rich North African country from the UN-backed GNA.

Despite UN-led efforts to secure a peace deal between the two factions -- as well as an ongoing UN arms embargo on Libya -- both the LNA and the Tripoli-based GNA have received military and financial support from international actors.

According to military intelligence released by the United States Africa Command, the LNA has received military support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, including on-the-ground support from private Russian military contractors.

Meanwhile, the GNA's counteroffensive against Haftar's attempt to take control of Tripoli has been supported by Turkey, who have provided GNA forces with both military hardware and assurances of on-the-ground support following the signing of a bilateral security deal in November 2019.

The Trump White House had taken an active interest in the ongoing conflict in 2019, reaching out to Haftar. But in recent months, the President's stance has changed, with Trump telling those leaders that he'd rather not get involved.

344,"Throughout the past nine years of conflict, the Syrian military has been instrumental in ensuring the survival of the Bashar al-Assad regimenot because of its performance on the battlefield, but rather due to its consistent loyalty. Unlike other state militaries that faced regime challenges by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, the Syrian armed forces maintained institutional loyalty. Since the Assad family took power in the 1970s, the military underwent a structural transformation that, through control mechanisms and the Alawite minoritys hegemonic position, ensured force loyalty and upheld the militarys central role in the durability of Syrias authoritarian regime.

However, the current conflict has truly impacted the configuration of the Assad regime as well as the structure and orientation of its military institution, putting the latters loyalty in question. Todays Syrian armed forces are fragmented, decision-making is contested and increasingly decentralized, and the circle of loyalty has widened in an unprecedented manner. Furthermore, a multiplication of security actors and entrenched foreign involvement have only complicated the Syrian security and defense sectors precarious condition, rendering civil-military relations less predictable and more vulnerable to regime challenges.

The pre-2011 Syrian military

Before discussing the changes, one ought to understand the Assad regimes pre-2011 military force. When Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970, Syrias civil-military relations were already at an acute degree of imbalance, where the military had a strong political orientation and a magnitude of authority. When building his regime, Assad was able to end the militarys notorious business in instigating regime change via coup détats. But he did so not by ending its political role, but by institutionalizing it so that it formed the backbone of the regimes power structure. Thus, the armed forces underwent a drastic transformation under Hafez, changing its character from a historically regime-challenging force into a pillar of regime security. The militarys role germinated to support Assads Baathist rule and secure his familys tight control over the states power structures.

To rearrange the military to befit his regimes objectives, Hafez significantly expanded its size. The total number of active armed personnel grew by around 162 percent in the first ten years of his rule and by around 264 percent upon his death in 2000, according to estimates compiled by the International Institute of Strategic Studies. Assad also infused a parallel chain of command and imposed overlapping mandates and institutional redundancy on key military formations. In this way, the various organs of the regimes coercive apparatus were designed with several layers of allegiance to compete and conjoin for regime survival.

Additionally, and arguably most importantly, Assad took advantage of the deeply divided condition of Syrian society. He elevated the number and role of the Alawitesthe minority community to which the Assad familys social and religious roots belong. Hafezand later Bashar al-Assadrecognized the impact ethnic inclusion in the military could have on the loyalty among its ranks. As a result, the Alawite were disproportionately represented in the armed forces and the wider security sector. While this posed a legitimacy problem with regards to the publics perception of the militarys national defense character, it also produced an institutionalized cycle of fear and distrust in Syrian society that not only provided the Assad regime with a loyal and hegemonized group in the military, but also made the Alawites dependent on the regime in a hostile and deeply divided country. As the Assad regime consolidated power, the militarys chief mission became clear: securing regime continuity above all national defense and security considerations.

Todays Syrian military: Fragmentation and foreign penetration

Prior to 2011, the Assad regime faced formidable domestic challengessuch as the Muslim Brotherhood rebellion in Hama in 1982 and Rifat Assads failed coup attempt in 1984in which the military played a central role in repelling. However, none were like the ongoing challenge that started in 2011, which, forced Bashar to rearrange and surrender some sovereignty over key power structures to maintain regime survival. While the structures that Hafez designed proved useful in standing against widespread public dissatisfaction in the first few years of the conflict, the increased capability of major rebel formations and the consequent battlefield ineffectiveness of Assads military prompted the inadvertent expansion of local security forces and import of foreign actors, such as Russia and Iran. Today, this has proven to be a tumorous growth in the Syrian military institution, causing loyalty dilemmas, diversification in funding sources, regional and ideological segmentation, parallel decision-making processes, and dependence on foreign patrons.

To adapt to evolving conflict dynamics, a kaleidoscope of unregulated militias and paramilitary forces with various funding sources and scopes of involvement emerged particularly after 2013 with Legislative Decree 55 to supplement the Syrian army. While some militias, such as the Local Defense Forces, were institutionalized in the regular army as an auxiliary force, many pro-regime militias remain in a grey legal and operational area contingent on what the post-war structure will look like. Some militias reportedly receive funding from shady pro-regime businessmen, while others are funded exclusively by foreign actors, such as Iran and Russia. As some of these militias took domestic security roles, their recruitment patterns became segmented along regional, religious, and ideological lines, which can indicate growing localized autonomies and a widened circle of loyalty, as well as security and defense incoherence.

This hybrid structure of the Syrian security sector forced de-centralization on military decision-making in a system that had long been ultra-centralized. Armed pro-regime militias have influence to affect key defense decisions, including resource distribution, mobilization, and deployment. Clashes among these militias have been reported throughout the Syrian conflict and across different frontlines. Moreover, the state-militia relationship is precarious, where militias have a patronage relationship with competing organs of the military-intelligence community. In light of engrained corruption and transactional interests, this can lead to conflicts within the military institution.

On the other hand, Russia and Iran have invested high stakes in the Syrian army and the wider security sector and currently exercise considerable influence over the military. While Moscow and Tehran improved the Syrian armys battlefield effectiveness and reversed its territorial losses, such victory came at a high price as the Assad regimes sole monopoly over the military decreased. Both foreign powers are increasingly involved in even the appointment of senior officers, unit commanders, and the leadership of intelligence commands. They also workedsometimes competitivelytowards institutionalizing and integrating the many militias into the Syrian armys command structure. Decision-making with regards to operational strategies is almost completely controlled by Russia and, to a lesser extent, Iran; Syrian army units associated with either foreign power increasingly take part in battles planned and conducted by their foreign allys troops or advisors. As a result, it can be assumed that Moscow also has influence over the allocation of resources within the military and can award loyal units and officers.

The other key aspect of the Syrian military is the presence and loyalty of the Alawites. While the Alawites hegemonic occupancy of the army heightened after 2011 due to Sunni defections, the communitys relationship with the military institutionand the regime by extensionchanged. Their military support of the Assad regime came at an immense cost; they disproportionally lost much of their youth on the battlefield while their community continues to be hurt by the growing deterioration of living conditions. As the Alawites sacrifice for a regime that is unable to provide them with basic necessitates, their circle of loyalty is widening to include emerging notables who are substituting risky military service with safer militia membership and state services with local charities.

Perhaps the recent crackdown on businessman and regime financier Rami Makhlouf seizing his assets, disbanding militias he financed, and shutting down his charitycan attest to his growing influence among the Alawites and the increasing vulnerability Assad is feeling with regards to his communitys support. However, the Alawites remain entrapped in the cycle of fear that the Assad regime created, which has isolated the minority community from the rest of Syrian society. This has made Assadfor the time being at leasta necessity for the communitys survival.

While the Syrian military played a key role in securing the Assad regimes survival, the structures that were once designed to keep its forces loyal have gradually shattered in the past nine years. Although the forced de-centralization, multiplication of security actors, and foreign involvement saved the Syrian regime from military defeat, Assad measures the quality of his forces by their consistent loyalty and willingness to use force for his regimes defense, not by their performance on the battlefield. While a coup against Bashar al-Assad or a collapse of his rule are unlikely, he no longer has the reliability that existed in the past fifty years.",nam
345,"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi headed to Washington for the first time this week since taking office in May  the most high-profile stage of a ""Strategic Dialogue"" expected to re-calibrate US-Iraq relations. But as he left, the situation at home had become increasingly tense.

Prominent anti-government activists were gunned down by unknown assailants on three occasions in Basra this week, a jump that has alarmed human rights organizations. Attacks on US targets in the country, thought to be carried out by pro-Iran factions, intensified to an almost daily occurrence after the trip was announced. It comes as a lack of public services, corruption and economic and coronavirus crises feed into an overall feeling of anger and frustration.

""Kadhimi's visit to Washington clearly angered the Iranian side and its factions in Iraq, as strengthening Iraq-US ties does not benefit them,"" Iraqi journalist Azhar al-Rubaie told DW from Basra.

Among all the pressures he faces, balancing the influence of Iran and the US is crucial to whether al-Kadhimi, well-known to be close to the US, has the power to stay the course and stabilize the country.

A costly visit

The visit did yield a $200 million (169 million) US aid package and the announcement of energy and finance contracts. But it could also prove politically costly for the PM, alienating him from powerful pro-Iran elements at home.

""[Iran has] massive equities in the country. It's got the militias, it's got networks of influence, it's got politicians that it's bought and paid for,"" Toby Dodge, Research Director for Iraq at the London School of Economics, said. ""What al-Kadhimi needs to do is keep some distance from Iran, but he can't alienate them either.""

Many expected the withdrawal of some 5,000 US troops from Iraq to be top of the summit's agenda but with nothing new announced, their continued presence may be a reprieve for al-Kadhimi.

He wants some level of those forces to stay to fight Islamic State (IS) and support him in reining in the country's militias. Pro-Iran armed groups under the umbrella of the loosely government-controlled Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), established to oust IS, want them out. Many of its members are linked to politicians in Iraq's parliament, which voted in favor of a US withdrawal earlier this year.

Although US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to discuss how a withdrawal might happen, President Donald Trump has often stated his desire to pull out. ""We look forward to the day when we don't have to be there,"" he said Thursday.

""The tension is between Trump's transactional, instrumental view that [he] doesn't want to get entangled, and then Pompeo, who sees the fight against Iran as the most important issue in American foreign policy in the Middle East,"" Dodge said.

Read more: Why the US and Iran are not at war

But the future of US military presence in Iraq was never really up for discussion, according to Ramzy Mardini, an associate at the University of Chicago's Pearson Institute. Instead, after US strikes in January killed Iranian and pro-Iran Iraqi commanders, the strategic dialogue was seen as way to deal with growing anti-American pressure in Iraq, Mardini said on Twitter.

Support in question ahead of elections

Having angered pro-Iran politicians and armed groups, al-Kadhimi now faces an uphill battle going into elections next year.

After a new electoral law designed to break the power of larger political blocs was passed late last year, he's pushing for early polls.

""What he'll try and do is build an electoral coalition which guarantees that he'll come back into power after that,"" Dodge said. ""But I still think because of this Iranian hostility, because of suspicions that al-Kadhimi's too pro-American, he's going to find it difficult to get another term in office after those elections.""

Others still have faith he will be able to rein in the militias and bring stability to the country after the recent spate of attacks on activists.

""Al-Khadimi will definitely stop them because he is not loyal to any side and is taking bold actions no one has ever taken,"" an activist from Basra, who did not want to be named due to the security situation, told DW.

The prime minister's proposal to establish a ""supreme committee"" charged with investigating major corruption, crime and assassinations has given the activist hope.

""Killing you just for being different from [the armed groups'] dogma is something that security forces should deal with. All party leaders who are criminals should be tried to deliver us a safer environment to live in,"" the activist said.",nam
346,"There has been a discernible shift in President Cyril Ramaphosas communications strategy. He replaced his spokesperson Khusela Diko in July after it emerged that her husband had his snout in the bountiful PPE feeding trough.

347,"Ohio resident Bill Bickham got in touch with Cocoa Beach police after he learned that big money was being siphoned from his older brothers bank account and credit card by an employee of the older man.

But when Bickhams sibling, a Cocoa Beach resident, died at age 87 in 2012, the case against the alleged perpetrator died along with him.

Financial exploitation directed at older Americans is so pervasive and increasing so quickly, its estimated that 20 percent of older adults have been a victim.

Theyre ripped off by relatives. Caregivers. Investment advisers and trusted friends. Often, theyre victimized by those with power of attorney. Credit and debit cards are misused; pension or benefit checks are stolen; and checks are written without authorization. And, in most cases, experts say, the money is not recovered.

Preventing exploitation

Tuesday, the American Bar Association, the nonprofit Investor Protection Trust and the nonprofit Investor Protection Institute announced a push to help curb such abuse, starting with a program to train attorneys to see exploitation and address it among clients.

The Elder Investment Fraud and Financial Exploitation Prevention Program Legal will be designed to teach lawyers to recognize clients possible vulnerability because of mild cognitive impairment; identify such fraud in their clients; and report suspected instances to appropriate authorities.

Because lawyers play such a significant role in advising and serving an aging society, especially around financial matters, their role in spotting, preventing and responding to financial exploitation needs to be as professional and effective as possible, said Charles Sabatino, director of the American Bar Associations Commission on Law and Aging.

Yet, it is not an area in which many are effectively trained, he said.

Anything that helps target abuse against older adults is welcomed by the Brevard State Attorneys Office, said Laura Moody, assistant state attorney.

Knowing the red flags is so critical, because what we find are numerous exploitation cases where the perpetrator is someone acting with legal authority, Moody said.

We dont see a lot of guardian cases, but we see a tremendous number of power of attorney abuse cases. Theyll get that legal authority through a lawyers office and deplete all the principals funds. We see trustee cases as well.

The ABA and IPT recently conducted a survey of more than 650 practicing attorneys nationwide in which they explored awareness of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

Among key findings:

 More than 9 out of 10 attorneys say elder investment fraud and financial exploitation is a very serious or somewhat serious problem.

 More than 1 in 3 attorneys says they are aware they are or may be dealing with the victims of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

 Roughly 9 out of 10 attorneys would be willing to participate in a continuing legal education program about detecting, preventing, and redressing elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

Its such a critical issue, that attorneys know their clients well; know their patterns and habits, Moody said.

In the past, weve asked a few of our civil lawyers to start putting warnings on documents like power of attorney documents. That gives a warning to the person that they know what their fiduciary obligations are, and they dont have an excuse later, like I thought I could do anything I wanted to do with this money. 

In the case of the Cocoa Beach man, a widower, the alleged perpetrator used her employers checks and credit card to make purchases mounting into thousands of dollars monthly.

Not until Bill Bickham learned of the abuse of his brothers finances did the pieces start to come together  but at least $100,000 was gone.

And though Moodys office and local law enforcement tried their best, she said, the victim refused to cooperate with prosecution of the alleged perpetrator. His death made it almost impossible to proceed, she said.

Its very important that people know whats going on with their family and that attorneys know about their clients, too, said Bickham, 76.

But my brother didnt have any children. And Im just his brother, and live out of state. He wasnt the type to go out and play golf or go to McDonalds and drink coffee with friends, so there was really no one out there noticing these things.

The case could possibly have been prosecuted succesfully, Moody said, under enhanced exploitation laws that go into effect in Florida this October.

Changes include a revised definition of exploitation of an elderly person or disabled adult (vulnerable adult). Penalties are enhanced for stealing personal ID information of anyone 60 or older, and theres a decrease in the property threshold values for exploitation of vulnerable adults offenses.

Along with family and medical professionals noting changes in behavior, its crucial for attorneys to see warning signs in their clients behavior, both physical and financial  no matter who has power over their finances, said Moody.

They represent the elder in these cases, she said. They dont represent the person who assumes that power.

Warning signs

Several agencies can assist older adults who may be victims of fraudulent activity.

 State attorneys office: 321-617-7510

 Elder Helpline: 800-963-5337

Experts say someone might be a victim of exploitation if they are:

 Taking a large amount out of the bank or other cash accounts.

 Making numerous withdrawals of smaller amounts, say, $100 at a time.

 Changing power of attorney or beneficiaries on insurance or investment accounts.

 Becoming too close with a much younger person or an inappropriate person, or have a caregiver too interested in a charges finances.",nam
348,"Having the chance to charm Rihanna must be pretty high on the list of most teenage boys.

And one lucky young man claims to have done just that, brsgging that he has scored a date with the global superstar after chatting her up in London.

Trainee stockbroker James Bufton, 17, met the stunning singer backstage after her show at O2 arena earlier this week and says they got along so well she invited him to visit her in New York.

Charming: Trainee stockbroker James Bufton with Rhianna claimed he has scored a date with the global superstar after chatting her up after a gig in London earlier this week

The youngster, from Newport, South Wales, even put out a press release saying that he has the Barbadian babe's phone number.

James said: 'She's a really lovely girl, really down to earth, normal and fun.

'Getting to meet her after the gig was a dream come true and we talked about everything under the sun.'

He also claimed: 'We chatted about how the tour is going, her interests, her songs and what she's planning on doing next.

'We even talked about meeting up again in New York - we're going to keep in touch.""

The pair met during an exclusive VIP party at the O2 Arena following her huge show earlier this week.

He managed to grab some time with her, resulting in the twosome having a photo together with Rihanna resting her head on the trainee stockbroker's shoulder and her hand on his chest.

But rather than carry on living out his dream, James left early because he had work the next day.

His employer Dan O'Connell said: 'There can't be many guys who would give up the chance to chat all through the night with Rihanna to catch a train so he'd be in for work bright and early the next morning.

'But James is a fantastic young man who is making a real name for himself in stockbroking.

'He has clearly got his head screwed on. He'll go far-who knows, he may even go to New York.'

Rihanna was recently linked with boxer Dudley O'Shaughnessy after the two apparently got together when he appeared in one of her music videos.

She was previously dating baseball player Matt Kemp and, prior to that, RnB singer Chris Brown.",nam
349,"Since 2007, Operational Risk, in collaboration with BAE Systems, has conducted a series of surveys covering key industry trends in financial crime, risk and compliance. This years survey shows continued investment in anti-fraud and compliance solutions. However, the focus and priorities of financial institutions appear to reflect the uncertainty of global markets and the growing impact of money laundering and counter-regulatory measures.

A key indicator of the overall health of the market is the change in investment in the two primary areas of financial crime: compliance and counter fraud. These two areas have seen sustained investment growth since the first survey was conducted in 2007. This comes despite retrenchment elsewhere in financial services (figure 1). This years survey indicates significant growth of investment in anti-money laundering (AML) and particularly non-AML compliance: 51.5% of respondents said that AML budgets would increase and 55% said that non-AML compliance budgets would increase, compared with 45% and 49.6%, respectively, for 2013. However, more financial institutions in 2016 than in 2013 say that their AML and non-AML budgets will decrease. This trend does not appear to be reflected in combatting fraud, where an almost identical percentage (41.8% in 2016 and 41.6% in 2013) indicates that investment will remain at the same level.

A shift in priority

We asked respondents what the financial crime priorities for senior management would be in the coming year (figure 2). In 2013  and for several years prior to that  insider fraud was regarded as the priority for respondents. However, this state of affairs has changed dramatically. As of this year, online fraud is the priority. The growth of remote banking channels, with the proportion of business conducted through online and mobile banking, is a possible explanation. According to the Global Mobile Banking Report, published by KPMG in conjunction with UBS Evidence Lab, this past growth is just the beginning. The number of mobile banking users globally is forecast to double to 1.8 billion over the next four years, representing more than one-quarter of the worlds population. In the US, 74% of banking customers used online banking in 2014, and 35% used mobile banking to access banking services. Payment fraud remains a strong priority, but is down when compared with 2013 numbers.

Insider fraud

Where does this leave insider fraud? In terms of priority initiatives for senior management, the survey revealed that it had fallen to a 5.61 average score in 2016 from 7.44 in 2013, when it was considered the second priority; only cheque and deposit fraud in 2016 are considered to be lower priority in banking. It could be that, as it is notoriously difficult to detect, senior management now believe the levels of insider fraud to be low and therefore of lower priority.

The survey measured fraud detection performance for the first time in 2016, and insider fraud detection is comparable with online fraud, for example, at 39.4% detected (however with a high false-positive rate at 29.5%). This would support an argument that this area has been a focus for financial institutions. However, further analysis of the survey participants suggests that the mix of relevant financial institutions is different in 2016 to that of 2013. In 2016, 32.6% of businesses did not use insider fraud detection, compared with 21.3% of businesses in 2013.

Most current research suggests that, far from being addressed, insider fraud is a growing problem. The Kroll Global Fraud Report 20152016, carried out with and conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, found that 60% of companies were defrauded by an insider  a 72% increase on the previous year. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) 2014 Report to the Nations, more than one insider colluding in a fraud is especially harmful, and appears in between 36% and 42% of cases covered by the report. Yet losses from this type of fraud have fallen from a median of $500,000 in ACFEs 2008 report to half this figure in 2014.

Changes in AML and compliance

Investment in AML remains significant, with 51.5% of respondents expecting budgets to increase over the next three years. The data also suggests financial institutions are shifting slightly towards solving this problem internally, with an increase from 20.6% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2016. In comparison, those going to third parties have fallen from 42.1% in 2013 to 35% in 2016. That said, third-party vendors remain the most popular option overall.

The survey asked respondents which solutions they would build in-house, as opposed to outsourcing (figure 3). This year saw a significant migration to third-party politically exposed persons (PEP) screening and sanctions solutions. Almost one-third (31.3%) went outside their organisations in 2013; that figure rose to 43.8% in 2016. This is possibly explained by the increasing development and focus of sanctions regimes introduced by governments around the world to target organised crime and stem the funding of terrorism, which has forced financial institutions to prioritise investment in this area. The expansion has resulted in a more complex set of actions and obligations and, for this reason, financial institutions are turning to third-party vendors.

Recently, it has been the considered view of many financial crime experts that financial institutions can benefit from combining fraud and AML resources to create efficiencies and identify crossovers. This years results suggest the idea has currency, with a more than 10-point jump in financial institutions using consolidated fraud and compliance solutions: 76.6% in 2016, compared with 65.7% in 2013. The trend is also towards third-party vendors providing these solutions, with 21.9% in 2016 compared with 13.7% in 2013.

The rise of application fraud

There has been a trend towards developing tools in-house for specific areas of financial crime. Notable in this group is application fraud (figure 3). Just over one-quarter (25.5%) of surveyed financial institutions now have an in-house solution, an increase of 2.2% since 2013. There has been a decline in the number of those that have a third-party application fraud solution (from 23.7% to 20.8%), and a decline in the number of financial institutions that said that they would possibly outsource their application fraud solution service over the next three years  from 18.3% to 15.1%.

The skewing towards internal spend could be explained in part by the common practice of tackling application fraud with existing fraud solutions. It would be interesting to analyse the impact on effectiveness of application fraud detection over time (beyond the scope of this research), as BAE Systems experience suggests that specific application fraud modelling and entity matching is required.

That said, fraud departments are also frequently challenged to justify additional IT spends, so may need to maximise what they have already. We will be watching this space carefully, given the increasing prevalence of the application fraud problem with the global migration towards EMV standard, and would expect the trend to in-house solutions to target this problem to be reversed.

Cyber attack

On the list of priority initiatives for senior management in 2013, cyber crime was included as a general category. At the time, it was cited as the highest priority, with 7.7% of the total.

With the increasing number of high-profile cyber attacks, and the increasingly documented connection with financial crime (the UKs National Fraud Investigation Bureau estimates that 43% of fraud is cyber-enabled), this years survey asked more specific questions about the perceived and likely impacts of a successful cyber attack on financial institutions (figures 4 and 5).

When asked what would be the likely financial cost of a successful cyber attack on their organisation, 36.7% of respondents said they did not know the estimated potential financial impact; 46.7% estimated this to be less than £10 million; and 23.3% estimated less than £1 million. This may reflect some widely reported figures that show that the average payout for a claim for a cyber breach is around £1 million (figure 4).

NetDiligences 2015 Cyber Claims Study notes the average claim for a breach at $673,000 and, for a large company, $4.8 million. The UK governments 2015 Information Security Breaches Survey suggests costs had risen from £600,000 in 2014 to £1.46 million in 2015 for large firms.

Yet this only refers to the direct costs of a cyber incident. The indirect costs can be far greater, and this is recognised in response to the second cyber-related question. Exactly half of respondents believed that the greatest risk to their business was reputational damage, and 30.6% considered loss of customer data to be the greatest risk. Direct monetary loss was the greatest risk for only 8.1% of respondents, which is unsurprising given how easy it is to insure against. In contrast, the damage to reputation can be far-reaching, long-term, and difficult to insure against. Detection and prevention technologies, in combination with relevant insurance protection, can be effective options for the financial institution to manage this risk (figure 5).

In summary, this years research has once again provided highly valuable insight into the key trends and the state of the financial crime market. Investment in financial crime defences is increasing, most significantly in AML and non-AML compliance. Leading the trend is the likely move to third-party solution providers for sanctions and PEP screening solutions, but also the move to consolidation between fraud and compliance solutions.",nam

How do countries ensure that remittance service providers  who are often serving the worlds poorest people  mitigate their risk for abuse by money launderers and terrorist organizations?
This important question is addressed by new Guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
The United Nations estimates that developing countries received over US$400 billion in remittances from migrants living abroad in 2014. These funds are often the first financial service that migrants and their families use, so it is important that people can send and receive funds with relative ease and at reasonable cost. However, remittance service providers and the governments that supervise them, must ensure that they are not abused by parties undertaking illegitimate activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.

The FATF calls remittance providers Money or Value Transfer Services (MVTS), and in its new guidance it dedicates considerable space to explaining the many business models that exist for this type of financial facility, and the ones that provide the best service for people who send and receive remittances.
FATFs Guidance is intended to assist countries, operators in the MVTS sector, as well as banks working with them, to better understand a risk-based approach to implementing measures to combat money-laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF). In a nutshell, this means that the measures to combat these ills should be commensurate with the risks they pose.
A very clear statement made in this new document is that while there may be instances when operators in this sector are abused by entities carrying out money laundering or terrorist financing, this should not necessarily result into categorisation of all MVTS providers as inherently high ML/TF risk. This is a positive sign to the MVTS sector, the banking sector, and governments who are working to avoid a broad-brush risk categorization of the sector that does not reflect the diversity of the providers.
The guidance clarifies that the overall risk of any MVTS provider is influenced by a number of factors. These include the extent and quality of the regulatory and supervisory framework, the implementation of risk-based controls, and other mitigating measures put in place by individual providers.
The FATF document also includes a section entitled  Access of MVTS to Banking Services, which confirms growing concern that banks are terminating relationships with MVTS, and is an explicit acknowledgement that this issue warrants attention at the international level. This is a timely and helpful addition to the ongoing global conversation about remittance service providers' access to bank accounts. It complements work already published by the World Bank in November 2015 concerning this topic.
The World Bank is an observer to the FATF. The majority of FATF members are developed countries, and the Bank plays an important role in providing a voice for developing countries who are not FATF members. Our team here actively provided inputs on the drafting of this Guidance, which is particularly relevant in the context of broader development agenda to achieve financial inclusion.
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which provides the detailed framework for the post-2015 development agenda, calls on the global community to address the most significant obstacles to the continued flow of remittances, including the withdrawal of banks from this business line. This guidance will help increase understanding among banks, governments, and MVTS providers as they grapple with managing risks imposed by bad actors in the system  without negatively affecting legitimate business.

Bank De-Risking Hurts Charities and Increases Risk of Laundering
A lack of access to financial services, particularly the inability to transfer funds overseas, can prevent lifesaving work from being carried out and has touched the refugee crisis in Europe, where many aid groups are delivering assistance.
November 4

The United States and United Kingdom recently published detailed money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments identifying both law enforcement and national security challenges. Read together, both the U.S. and U.K. risk assessments provide a stronger understanding of how two leading economies approach myriad money laundering and terrorist financing risks to help stakeholders better identify, analyze, and mitigate the challenges that they face.

These reports support the broader legal and policy architecture around anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism of each country using the risk-based approach under the Financial Action Task Force, and comport with applicable FATF guidance. Although the reports cover the same general subjects, they suggest both similarities and differences in how the two nations view various threats.

What follows is a comparative analysis of the assessments' structure and scope, as well as how they treated the specific issues of beneficial ownership and digital currencies.

Structure and Scope

The U.K. and U.S. assessments both identified threats, vulnerabilities and consequences within industries impacted by money laundering and terrorist financing.

The U.K. took an empirical approach, attempting to quantify the levels of risk within each industry and giving each a ""score"" based on a range of factors. The attempt to measure and quantify risk by industry and payment method was creative, but the result does not appear sufficient to clarify stakeholders' obligations to combat laundering using a risk-based approach. The U.K. report also included an assessment of its government's capabilities. It recognized that some supervisory regimes were ""inconsistent"" and described the law enforcement response to money laundering until 2012 as ""weak.""

The U.S. assessments, by contrast, focused primarily on government and law enforcement efforts to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. The assessments were drafted by Treasury's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, in consultation with other government offices. The U.S. reports were exhaustively researched, examining over 5,000 money-laundering indictments and other charging documents, along with 229 terrorism-related cases.

Like the U.K. report, the U.S. assessments identified risks and vulnerabilities within impacted industries. However, the terrorist-financing assessment contained no explicit private sector input, while private sector participation in the money laundering assessment was indirect  through submission of suspicious activity and currency transaction reports reviewed and analyzed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. One analysis suggested that the U.S. reports should be understood in the context of the current FATF peer review of the U.S. AML and CFT framework, scheduled for public release in January 2016, which may suggest another audience that the U.S. was attempting to engage through its assessment.

The most striking dissimilarity in the structure of the reviews is that the U.K. assessment combined its money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments into one report, the National Risk Assessment, while the U.S. analysis split the two topics into separate assessments: the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and the National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment.

The U.K. report primarily focused on money laundering, with only the final chapter devoted to terrorist financing. However, it emphasized that terrorists often use the same methods to raise, store and move funds as those involved in laundering money, which partially explains why its terrorist financing assessment was so brief. In contrast, the U.S. terrorism financing report thoroughly explored many ways that terrorists obtain financing  including kidnapping for ransom, drug trafficking, and individual fundraising not affiliated with a charitable organization  none of which were in the U.K. report.

Beneficial Ownership

Both the U.S. and U.K. reports discussed the complex and politically charged issue of beneficial ownership. In the banking context, a beneficial owner is the individual who owns or controls a bank account. The use of nominees and shell companies, along with providing inaccurate beneficial owner information, were identified as vulnerabilities to banks.

The U.K. report dedicated an entire chapter to the money laundering threats and vulnerabilities posed by legal entities and arrangements such as companies, trusts, and partnerships with hidden owners. Importantly, the U.K. report described how corporate structures could be used to hide the natural individuals directing those structures. The report also identified information gaps in so-called ""high-end"" money laundering activities facilitated by professional enablers, particularly those in the legal and accounting fields, using financial institutions and real estate.

The U.S. money laundering report addressed beneficial ownership as one of five money laundering vulnerabilities to the financial system. Nominees and the misuse of legal entities were listed as risks as well.

As the U.S. money laundering report notes, the United States still does not have a federal beneficial ownership requirement for legal entities, although Fincen's proposal requiring stronger bank customer due diligence procedures is awaiting publication as a final rule. In July 2015, the International Money Fund published a particularly critical technical note that both described the AML and CFT risks posed by the lack of U.S. beneficial ownership legislation and suggested possible deficiencies in the pending Fincen rule.

These details are important because the White House recently published a statement mentioning the risk assessments as evidence of the United States fulfilling its pledges under the G-20 Beneficial Ownership Action Plan. In its statement, the White House renewed its commitment to advocate for comprehensive legislation to impose a beneficial owner requirement. But beneficial ownership reforms remain a contested political issue here. Some in the U.S. legal community contend that stronger requirements would undermine client confidentiality while state-level officials claim collecting the information would be burdensome.

Digital Currencies

Both the U.S. and U.K. reports evaluated the AML and CFT risks and vulnerabilities related to virtual currencies.

Virtual currencies are not currently regulated in the U.K. However, in August 2014, the U.K. government announced a ""major programme of work"" and published a call for information related to the risks and benefits of virtual currencies, and to whether government regulation was necessary. In March 2015, the U.K. government published its findings, concluding there is a ""strong case"" for introducing AML regulations. The U.K. report, using its scoring system, nevertheless deemed the current money-laundering risk associated with virtual currencies ""low."" The report said misuse of virtual currencies was primarily related to cybercrime and there was ""little evidence"" that virtual currencies have been ""incorporated into established money laundering techniques."" The report also concluded that criminals involved in terrorist financing were not currently using virtual currencies to raise funds, pay for infrastructure or move money into and out of the country.

The U.S. is a step ahead of the U.K. in terms of regulating digital currencies. In March 2013, Fincen issued interpretive guidance clarifying that administrators and exchangers of digital currency are ""money transmitters"" under a July 2011 rule, thereby obligating them to comply with the AML and CFT regulations that apply to money transmitters. Fincen announced its first digital currency enforcement action in 2015. Also, in June 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services released its regulatory framework for digital currency firms.

According to the U.S. money laundering report, although dealers in virtual currency are subject to the same U.S. regulations as other money transmitters and face the same risks of prosecution for misfeasance, money laundering vulnerabilities continue to mount. Risks tied to virtual currency include the rapid evolution of the market, spurred by more involvement from the technology sector, and the potential of some virtual currency dealers to operate without a domestic presence.",nam
353,"JOE Biden told supporters ""we're going to win"" and warned Americans against ""partisan warfare"" as he edges towards a White House win.

The Democrat boasted last night he was surging past Donald Trump with a clear majority in the race for the White House.

Biden told the rally in Delaware that he was on course for more than 300 Electoral College votes as the battle for Arizona and Pennsylvania drags on.

""We're going to win this race,"" he said as the tense count continued, citing how the Dems ""rebuilt the blue wall that crumbled just four years ago.""

He also appealed for people to be more ""civil with one another"" as ugly scenes broke out across the country with protesters clashing and gun-wielding mobs storming vote counts.

The Democrat said: ""We may be opponents, but we're not enemies. We're Americans.

Their nail-biting battle continues as:

Biden, who took to the podium alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, again urged Americans to be patient and acknowledged that ""tensions can run high"" during a tough election.

""Let the process work out as we count all the votes,"" he said from the stage in Wilmington, shortly after 10.45pm local time. ""Your vote will be counted.""

Biden said he didn't care how much people tried to hinder or stop the vote count as after Trump repeatedly made claims of voter fraud.

He resolved not to ""fan the flames of conflict but to solve conflict"" but to ""leave the anger and demonization behind us.""

The former vice president said: ""Were certainly not going to agree on a lot of issues but at least we can agree to be civil with one another.

""My responsibility as president will be to represent the whole nation. And I want you to know that Ill work as hard for those who voted against me as those that voted for me.

""Thats the job. Thats the job. Its called the duty of care, for all Americans.

But Trump accused his rival of wrongfully claiming the presidency on Friday evening.

The president also warned that his legal action against battleground states was ""just beginning"".

Trump, who has been holed up in the White House all day, tweeted: ""Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President.

""I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!""

He went on to cast more doubt on mail-in ballots, tweeting: ""I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by.

""Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!""

BIDEN HIS TIME

Biden seems increasingly certain of victory, but a final vote count is still not expected until days from now.

The Democrat faces a nail-biting wait as votes are counted in Pennsylvania  which could seal the White House for him  and Georgia announced a recount.

A win in the Keystone State would see Biden sail past the 270-threshold needed to win the electoral college and take the presidency.

Currently he is just 17 votes away from becoming the President-elect.

But a Supreme Court ruling last night ordered late mail-in ballots that arrived in Pennsylvania after election day be counted seperately - as Republicans hope to get them scrapped entirely.

And Philadelphia City Commissioner's office said yesterday there are still an estimated 40,000 ballots yet to be counted.

One official added: ""it may take several days to complete the reporting of that.""

Trump on Wednesday alleged there was tremendous corruption surrounding mail-in ballots in a number of battleground states.

But yesterday Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney shot down the president's claims of voter fraud.

He said: ""While some, including the President, continue to spew baseless claims of fraud... what we have seen here in Philadelphia is democracy plain and simple.""

Flailing Trump has refused to admit he is beaten and is reportedly ""planning a victory rally"" this weekend.

'RACE IS NOT OVER'

While his camp insist he still has a chance of winning the race to the White House.

Matt Morgan, the President's general counsel, said: "" This election is not over.

""The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final.

""Georgia is headed for a recount, where we are confident we will find ballots improperly harvested, and where President Trump will ultimately prevail.""

Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Secretary of State, announced Friday: ""Georgia still too close to call, but results will be very close, and there will be a recount. Promises transparency.""

Sources said Trump would refuse to concede  even if Biden was declared the winner  and his son Don Trump Jr urged him to go to war over the result.

But Andrew Bates, a senior member of Biden's team, hit back: ""As we said on July 19th, the American people will decide this election.

""And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.""

The former VP looks set to capture the 20 electoral votes from Pennsylvania, which would propel him into the White House, making him the 46th President of the United States.

Biden has fought back a deficit of nearly 1million votes in the Keystone State after a huge surge in mail-in ballots which Trump branded ""fraudulent"" and demanded counting be stopped.

A victory in PA would put the Democrat firmly over the 270 electoral college vote mark ending Trump's explosive four-year tenure in the White House.

Just before 11pm ET on Friday, Biden led Trump by 28,833 votes in Pennsylvania, where 96 percent of the votes have been voted.

23

A recount in Pennsylvania will be automatically triggered if the margin of the final vote is 0.5 percent or less.

Biden was leading Trump by 7,248 votes in Georgia  where 99 percent of the votes bad been counted by 9pm  at 49.42 percent .

The President blamed a burst water piper for his trailing behind in the Peach state.

During a press conference last night, Trump said: ""In Georgia a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened.""

Winning Georgia would give Biden 269 electoral votes - meaning he would effectively have a clear path to the Oval Office.

No Democrat has carried Georgia since 1992 when Bill Clinton flipped the state against George W Bush.

Biden could also win the election if he secures Georgia's electoral votes while maintaining his current lead in Arizona.

The Associated Press and Fox News called The Grand Canyon State for Biden, where he is ahead of Trump by 29,861 votes at 49.72 percent to 48.8 percent.

A record number of Americans voted in this historic election as the country battles the Covid-19 pandemic.

Those voting in person joined 102 million citizens who voted early, a figure that represents 73 percent of the total turnout of the 2016 election.

A lot of the mail-in ballots that are still being counted have come from Democrat-leaning counties, which explains Biden's gains since Tuesday.

NO FLY ZONE

Meanwhile, a no-fly zone was put into place on Election Day over the area of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the temporary flight restrictions were put in place for special security reasons.

The rule is set until Saturday, November 7.

Another physical signs of Bidens march to what appeared an inevitable victory is his bodyguard Secret Service detail was increased considerably.

An increase in security is a typical operation when someone is likely to become US President-elect.

As Biden waited for the keys to the White House at his home in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday, he declared he was doing everything possible to protect the election.

He tweeted: The people will not be silenced, be bullied, or surrender. No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.

America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.

It comes after Trump accused Democrats of trying""steal"" the election in an incredible speech from the White House last night.

Bitter Trump singled out mail-in ballots which he suggested were suspicious in being ""overwhelmingly"" for Biden.

The President told reporters: ""If you count the legal votes I easily win. If you count the illegal votes  they can try to steal the election from us.""

HOLDING A RECOUNT

Joe Biden has a slender lead over Donald Trump in the race to 270 electoral votes.

The Democrat has so far flipped three states that Trump won in 2016  Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona.

But the President wants a recount of votes in Wisconsin and has filed lawsuits to stop vote counting in both Michigan and Pennsylvania.

The recount of votes can be complicated because the guidelines are set at state and sometimes local levels.

THE RULES

Wisconsin  a recount cannot be requested until election results are verified on December 1. State rules also dictate that a recount can only be requested by a candidate if the race is separated by a margin of one per cent or less.

Michigan  the state conducts an automatic recount if candidates are separated by a margin of 2,000 total votes or less. To get a recount by request, a campaign must submit a petition over alleged fraud or counting errors within 48 hours.

Pennsylvania  the state only provides an automatic recount if the race is separated by a margin of 0.5 percent or less, or if election officials find irregularities in the results

Georgia - a candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5% and that request must be made within two day of the results being certified.

Trump vowed he would not allow unfounded ""corruption to steal such an important election"" or ""silence"" GOP voters after debunked voter fraud claims flooded social media.

""They did the mail in ballots where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on,"" he raged. ""I told everybody that these things would happen.""

""I've already decisively won,"" Trump insisted, hours after Biden said he had ""no doubt"" he had won the nail-biting battle for the Oval Office.

Citing his victories in Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa, Trump declared that there was ""no blue wave that they predicted"" as he touted Republican gains in the House.

"" Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, and big tech,"" he told reporters, as the counting continued in key states like Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona yesterday.

""The Republicans have become the party of the American worker,"" Trump added, before slamming the ""phony"" media polling, which he claimed was ""election interference in the truest sense of that word.""

Why is Trump taking his election battle to court

Trump has filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan.

He was demanding better access for Republican observers to locations where ballots are being counted.

A statement from the campaign said in Michigan that they haven't been given ""meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.""

The Georgia lawsuit filed in Chatham County essentially asks a judge to ensure the state laws are being followed on absentee ballots

The Trump campaign also filed a lawsuit to intervene in a Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court that deals with whether ballots received up to three days after the election can be counted.

A spokesman for Trumps team said: This is the most important election of our lifetime, and President Trump made clear our path forward last night: ensure the integrity of this election for the good of the nation.

Bad things are happening in Pennsylvania. Democrats are scheming to disenfranchise and dilute Republican votes. President Trump and his team are fighting to put a stop to it.

354,"In early September, Cristina Velez lost her job running the staffing team on a Covid-19 treatment trial. Faced with a $2,440 rent bill on the Boca Raton, Fla., home she shares with her daughter, Velez began calling her landlord, Progress Residential, to ask whether it would give her time to come up with the money.

""I told them I was affected by Covid, but it didn't matter to them,"" Velez said. ""They are not very patient.""

On Sept. 8, Progress gave her an ultimatum  pay the rent or deliver the premises, a Palm Beach County court filing shows. Just over two weeks later, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Velez, demanding $4,210.14 in rent and legal fees, delivering the papers to her door.

Not once, Velez said, did Progress representatives tell her about a nationwide eviction moratorium ordered by the federal government to let tenants hurt by Covid-19 stay in their homes if they couldn't pay their rent. The moratorium, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sept. 4, bars landlords from evicting tenants who affirm that they've been harmed by the coronavirus for nonpayment of rent.

""I said, 'There's got to be something for people affected by Covid and being furloughed,'"" Velez, 46, reported telling Progress. ""There's nothing we can do,"" the company representative replied, she said.

Velez said she sold her car to pay Progress.

From early September to Oct. 17, despite the CDC eviction ban, almost 10,000 eviction actions have been filed in 23 counties in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas by large corporate landlords like the one that owns Velez's house, court documents show. After at least one landlord group lobbied the Trump administration, the CDC clarified its ban on Oct. 9, opening the door for still more such actions. New eviction filings have jumped since then, court records show. During the week of Oct. 12, for example, almost 2,000 proceedings were recorded in the five states, almost twice the number from the previous week.

The evictions are part of a database compiled by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that examines the impact of private equity on communities. It began compiling eviction statistics after the pandemic hit, although it isn't known how many evictions are related to the coronavirus.

Large landlords filing numerous evictions include prosperous U.S. public companies like Invitation Homes, which owns and leases 80,000 single-family homes nationwide. The company is thriving  its earnings rose by 54 percent for the first six months of the year, and its stock price has jumped by 80 percent since the market bottomed out in March. Court records show 122 eviction filings by Invitation Homes in the five states during the period.

Velez's eviction action is one of 97 cases filed against tenants by Progress Residential since the CDC announced its ban. Progress, a large and well-funded landlord, owns and leases 40,000 single-family homes nationwide. It is owned by Pretium Partners, a $3 billion hedge fund that invests in distressed properties.

A spokesman for Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Velez in the eviction filing.

In a statement, the spokesman said: ""Progress Residential continually engages with tenants on matters related to their leases. While each matter is unique, we are committed to working with tenants, as appropriate, to try and provide assistance during these extraordinary times.

""Progress Residential complies with applicable law, including the CDC Moratorium, in enforcing rental evictions. Importantly, as part of the CDC Moratorium, tenants are required to provide a declaration that makes clear they are unable to pay rent due to the impact of Covid-19.""

Pretium, the company that owns Progress Residential, is overseen by Donald Mullen, a former Goldman Sachs partner who headed the bank's mortgage and credit operation until he left in 2012. Mullen's work at Goldman emerged in a 2010 Senate investigation into the causes of the mortgage crisis when investigators published a 2007 email he wrote about the ""serious money"" Goldman was poised to make as the mortgage market began to collapse.

Through a spokesman, Mullen declined an interview request about eviction proceedings by Progress Residential and his work at Pretium and Goldman.

Other big landlords filing evictions are owned by private equity firms, such as the Carlyle Group, with 42 actions, the documents show. The top eviction filer, according to the documents, is Ventron Management LLC, a Canadian real estate firm that has brought 281 proceedings.

""The decisions of large companies to advance evictions despite the moratorium quite literally threatens the health of residents and the broader public,"" said Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. He said the five-state figures are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg.

Kristi DesJarlais, senior vice president at Invitation Homes, cast doubt on the eviction figures collected by the nonprofit. ""We question the veracity of the list,"" she said.

In addition, she said eviction wasn't a course the company wants to pursue. ""We have been doing what the CDC order directs since early in the pandemic,"" she said in a statement, ""working with our residents facing Covid-related financial hardships and offering a variety of payment options so they can stay in their homes.""

Ventron didn't respond to an email seeking comment. A Carlyle spokeswoman declined to provide an on-the-record statement.

'An overreach of authority'

When it announced the ban on Sept. 1, the CDC said it was crucial to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Many tenants, out of work because of Covid-19 shutdowns, are struggling to pay their rent; the CDC estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their homes without eviction protections in place.

The CDC action followed the expiration in late August of a narrower eviction moratorium in the CARES Act. Under the CDC ban, tenants are responsible for paying the full amount of rent owed.

The recent rise in evictions may be related to a new CDC notice on Oct. 9 clarifying the terms of the ban, tenant advocates say.

August: Pennsylvania renters fear eviction during pandemic

Sept. 1, 202003:04

The new CDC notice specifies that landlords can begin eviction proceedings now, even though they aren't supposed to remove tenants before the end of the year. The new notice also said landlords aren't required to notify tenants about the ban or its terms.

Landlords are also free to challenge tenants' sworn attestations of harm from Covid-19, according to the CDC's clarification, and the agency made it clear that there is no administrative appeal process for tenants faced with such challenges.

The notice from the CDC this month narrowed what had been a broad ban on evictions, tenant groups say, and it gave landlords the upper hand. They warn that a tsunami of homelessness will result, along with lasting financial damage to renters.

It ""puts more power back in the hands of landlords at the expense of low-income renters,"" said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit. ""It creates new burdens for renters and creates new holes in protections for renters.""

A spokesman for the CDC didn't respond to a request for comment about the initial ban and the subsequent changes to it.

Landlord advocacy groups criticized the initial ban and lobbied to change it. One, the National Apartment Association, took credit for the CDC's clarification, describing on its website "" first-hand conversations with the Trump administration and the U.S. Department of Justice"" to battle the ban. The association and other landlord groups are also contesting the legality of the moratorium in court.

""From our perspective, the CDC order was an overreach of their authority, and landlords needed clarification on how to proceed,"" said Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive of the National Apartment Association. ""It's been seven months, and we have members experiencing some financial burdens as a result and carrying a lot of debt.""

'Ethically challenged evictions'

While the CDC ban centers on Covid-19-related harm among renters, it doesn't bar evictions for other reasons, such as those related to health and safety threats by tenants, property damage or criminal activities.

Eviction filings tallied by the nonprofit may well include such cases. But some who work in evictions say landlords at times make faulty claims when pursuing them.

Joe Ferguson is a constable in Pima County, Arizona, and among his tasks is delivering eviction notices to tenants. He works to help combat their removal and explain what their options are.

Many evictions in Pima County are wrongful and violate the CDC moratorium, Ferguson said.

""As we get closer to Dec. 31, there is intense pressure by some landlords to push through ethically challenged evictions,"" Ferguson said. ""Some evictions need to go forward, but in other cases it's people relying on the legal system to go through loopholes.""

As new eviction filings pile up, so do difficulties for tenants. Because evictions can appear on tenants' credit reports, renters may have more difficulty finding new homes, with other landlords likelier to reject their applications. Evictions often push renters into poverty, research shows, with mental and physical health declining along with the likelihood of finding a job.

The recent rise in eviction filings will push many renters to move out even if they qualify to remain in their homes under the CDC ban, tenant advocates say.

""In many states around the country, you can't cure an eviction once it is filed,"" said Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project. ""People are going to get notices and are going to feel they've been evicted and will move out. The CDC order created an incentive for unethical behavior by landlords.""

Pinnegar said the National Apartment Association is encouraging its members ""to operate in a legal and lawful manner."" He said he doesn't expect massive homelessness.

To be sure, the coronavirus has imperiled small, local landlords who have limited cash to sustain their operations. Tenant groups worry that those landlords will be forced to sell their properties to bigger operations, increasing the number of rental units in the hands of institutional landlords.

One consolidation deal was announced Oct. 19, when Pretium Partners, Progress Residential's owners, announced a joint purchase of Front Yard Residential Corp., a public real estate investment trust that owns 14,500 rental homes, with Ares Capital, a private equity firm. Front Yard has filed 97 eviction proceedings in the five states since Sept. 1, the documents show. Pretium and Ares said they will pay $2.4 billion for Front Yard.

After the deal goes through, Pretium will be the nation's second-largest owner and operator of single-family rental homes, it said.

In the meantime, other large and prosperous companies that have ramped up eviction filings include Greystar Real Estate Partners, a private investment firm, which has filed 61 eviction notices, and Eaton Vance, an asset management company, with 48 eviction proceedings. Eaton Vance is being purchased by Morgan Stanley in a $7 billion deal; Morgan Stanley itself, through its AMLI Residential unit, initiated 22 eviction proceedings since Sept. 1.

Eaton Vance, Front Yard and Morgan Stanley all said that they work with tenants in difficulty and that their eviction filings were proper and in accordance with the CDC moratorium. Greystar didn't respond to an email request for comment.

Don Smith has also had problems with Progress Residential, although they aren't Covid-19 related. Smith and his family, who are tenants in Apopka, Florida, had to move out in July. He said his wife has stage four breast cancer and uses a wheelchair; facing huge medical bills, they could no longer afford the rent.

Smith contacted Progress and told it that they were leaving the premises; he said Progress thanked him for letting the company know.

But on Sept. 24, Progress filed eviction proceedings against Smith in court, demanding payment of rent owed and legal fees amounting to $4,218.37.

Smith said he knew nothing about the filing until NBC News contacted him. Now he is concerned that he will have to make the additional payment to clear the eviction from his record.

""They weren't a good landlord. I wouldn't call them good at all,"" Smith said in an interview. ""The sinks were rusting out, and they just painted over it. They'd only fix what they had to.""

Progress declined to comment on the record about its interactions with Smith.

If the CDC moratorium expires without a replacement, a wave of evictions is likely, housing advocates say.

""When you hit Jan. 1, people will owe tens of thousands in back rent,"" said Chris Groninger, chief strategy officer for the Arizona Bar Foundation, a nonprofit that helps low-income people. ""We are creating poverty as we speak.""

By jumping through hoops, Cristina Velez of Boca Raton has managed to pay enough to hang on to her rental home. She has a new job, but she has still had to battle demands from Progress to pay $450 in legal fees associated with her eviction filing.

When Velez challenged the propriety of the eviction after talking with NBC News, the Progress representative told her that the court wouldn't have allowed Progress to make the filing if the eviction wasn't valid. That is false, said Roller of the National Housing Law Project  courts don't verify the accuracy of initial eviction filings.

Velez said the representative declined to detail the process at Progress when she asked about it. According to Velez, he said: ""I don't have to tell you what my process is. We have a company to run.""",nam

357,"This week the New York Times is running a series of hard-hitting investigative reports into who is buying luxury apartments in a single skyscraper overlooking Central Park in New York City, called Time Warner Center, and how they are doing it. It has highlighted a dubious bunch of big spenders allegedly enjoying the proceeds of corruption, including criminals and tax evaders.

What the reporting illustrates is that it is very easy for people to hide the origins of their wealth: more than half the luxury apartments in Time Warner Center are not officially owned by individuals but by people concealing their identity through shell companies.

In Europe, this week, Le Monde working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and some 60 news outlets, have collaborated on a series of articles that allege that HSBC, the UKs biggest bank, gave advice to high-net-worth customers on how they can evade taxes. In addition, the documents show that the global banking giant allegedly profited from doing business with arms dealers who channeled mortar bombs to child soldiers in Africa, bag men for developing world dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws.

The common link here is secrecy. People get away with money laundering and tax evasion because of two big loopholes: the ease of setting up a secret shell company and a lack of oversight by professionals who should be asking questions about the origins of their clients wealth and the legality of the accounts.

In the case of New York real estate, much of the money to fund a luxury lifestyle appears to have come from the proceeds of corruption. In the case of HSBC, it is both the corrupt and also high-net-worth individuals who want to hide their cash and evade taxes.

Last year Transparency International launched a campaign called Unmask the Corrupt, to push governments to eliminate the secrecy of shell companies as a way to stop corruption and to ensure that there is greater oversight and due diligence when suspicious customers attempt to buy expensive real estate properties and luxury goods.

The change in laws to prohibit shell companies would be relatively simple. It would require that the names of the real owners of companies (the so-called beneficial owners) be made public through central public registries of companies. These public registries would show who owns, controls and benefits from companies.

This approach was recently given a boost by the Group of 20 leading economies and especially by the European Union, which have acted to support greater transparency of beneficial owners by endorsing the use of central registries. The issue now is whether these will be available to everyone. For this, we need to exert greater public pressure.

Nevertheless, central registries would make it easier for banks to comply with their duties to check who their customers really are and whether the sources of their funds are legitimate. They would have fewer excuses for entering into business relationships with clients who are already known, for example, to have connections with arms trafficking, blood diamonds or bribery.

Shells in New York

New York City is dotted with luxury properties owned by shell companies. In the Bloomberg tower on Lexington Avenue, for example, over half the condominiums are owned by shell companies. In The Plaza on Fifth Ave, its two-thirds; at One57, its more than three-quarters. And the list goes on: at the Time Warner Center it is 64 percent and at Trump International and 15 Central Park West, more than half the properties in each building are owned by anonymous companies.

In fact, the roughly 900 condos in these buildings are worth more than the combined cost of 20,000 average American homes, according to the New York Times reports which quote the statistic that in 2014, 54 percent of sales over US$5 million in Manhattan were to shell companies.

It is simply not clear whether anyone selling the properties followed legal obligations to find out how the potential buyers came by their wealth.

We believe it is crucial to adopt legal measures and fully enforce regulations (where already existing) that require enabling businesses such as banks and real estate agents to comply with anti-money laundering obligations, including providing due diligence checks and reporting suspicious activities.

Transparency Internationals analysis of data from the European Union also paints a disappointing picture: among all the suspicious transactions reported in 2010, for example, only 1 in 2,500 was submitted by real estate agents. In Germany, the UK and Italy, national reports reveal the same worrying trend: real estate agents and high-value dealers are not routinely reporting suspicious transactions.

Less of these scandals would break if there was real transparency and accountability in the global financial sector. Thats why we launched the Unmask the Corrupt campaign to try and push governments to mandate the kind of openness that the corrupt are frightened of.",nam
358,"Above: Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein in spotlight surrounded by reporters at news conference on Maryland Health Exchange.

This is slightly edited version of a column that appears in the August edition of The Business Monthly serving Howard and Anne Arundel counties.

By Len Lazarick

Len@MarylandReporter.com

It was easy to feel sorry for state Secretary of Health & Mental Hygiene Joshua Sharfstein during the last couple of years. When it was announced he was leaving the department late last month, the only surprise was that his departure wasnt immediate and that it hadnt happened sooner.

Instead, Sharfstein will hang on to the very end of the OMalley administration, before he moves on to The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said he wanted to oversee the implementation of the revamped Maryland Health Care Exchange that was such a flop last year.

Sharfstein seemed a likely person to blame in that debacle  after the head of the exchange was fired. Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was ostensibly in charge of the exchange, but internal documents revealed that he didnt know much about what was going on.

Sharfstein was the cabinet secretary actually in charge, and if he wasnt paying close enough attention as the contractors missed deadlines and squabbled, he was certainly paying attention after thousands of Marylanders couldnt sign up for health insurance.

Too much Dysfunction

Sharfstein already had too much dysfunction begging for attention at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department with that rather antiquated name has the largest single budget in the state; this fiscal year, the department is due to spend $11.4 billion, nearly a third of the total state budget, with half of it in federal money tied mostly to Medicaid for the poor and disabled.

Sharfstein, a Harvard-trained physician, is bright and incredibly diligent, but that was not always good enough to steer an agency that has too much on its plate. It has a dozen major agencies under its umbrella, and several of those agencies have chronic serious problems that the legislatures auditors and budget analysts have pointed out time and again.

The well-documented problems with the Maryland Health Exchange were perhaps the most immediately visible and controversial. Not only didnt the website work, but the state may have failed to properly oversee the vendors. And the board overseeing it violated the Open Meetings Law when it was deciding what to do about it.

Assisted living audits lacking

In June, an audit found that the departments Office of Health Care Quality has failed to fix many of the problems highlighted in at least three previous audits dating back at least to 2004. There are more than 1,300 licensed assisted living facilities in Maryland caring for thousands of residents who are not quite able to care for themselves; but year after year during the past decade, the state health department has failed to do required annual inspections for a majority of them.

The department said it was trying to fix the problems that also extend to thousands of other health care facilities, nursing homes and the like. One solution is to stop trying to do annual visits of every facility, but only focus on the ones with clear problems.

In July, the Baltimore Suns investigative unit uncovered a case where a severely disabled child died in a group apartment in the Russett section of Laurel in Anne Arundel County.

It turned out that the nonprofit operator of the group home had been in bankruptcy. The state had not been told and the operator did not have enough money to cover the required staffing for these children and adults with multiple and severe disabilities. The operation was stopped, and the children were moved.

Unspent money for disabilities

The Developmental Disabilities Administration is one of the larger units in the health department, assisting 27,000 patients. Its caregivers manage a wide range of disabilities, from mild to severe. The DDA has thousands of people waiting for services, but three years ago, it was discovered that the agency had left more than $35 million of an $830 million budget unspent, and had to return $25 million to the state treasury.

Part of the problem was the department was still keeping its financial records on paper and had a hard time keeping tracking of its funds. Sharfstein got heavily involved, hired a new director, had large town hall meetings with clients and caregivers to explain the situation and ultimately replaced the new director with his own chief of staff.

At one large town hall meeting late last year in Columbia, Sharfstein showed up late to hear from the hundreds who came to listen and complain. His excuse: He was working on the Maryland Health Care Exchange.

One million on Medicaid

The problems with Medicaid, the Medical Care Programs Administration, are as large as its $8.1 billion dollar budget, complicated by a rapidly growing program that now covers more than a million Marylanders. One-sixth of all state residents now get their health insurance through Medicaid, due to expanded coverage under Obamacare.

But the legacy computer system that processes the millions of claims from health care providers is old and cranky, and the process to replace it, using a special federal grant, has been long and troubled, budget analysts said. It got so bad last year, that the department needed to come up with a new development strategy.

This clunky old claims processing makes it harder and slower to uncover fraud and overbilling that goes on in such a huge program, largely perpetrated by doctors, nursing homes, therapists and drug companies.

At a hearing last year, the departments inspector general estimated that 3% to 9% of claims are overpaid, sometimes because of honest mistakes, sometimes on purpose. That totals from $240 million to $720 million a year  but the fraud unit in the attorney generals office is catching only a fraction of that amount.

Solutions not simple

Discussing these issues, Del. Guy Guzzone, D-Howard, co-chair of the Joint Audit Committee, said its tempting to think that a structural solution, like splitting up some of the health department, might cure some of its administrative ills. But while appealing, that he said wouldnt necessarily cure the deeper management problems in some of these agencies.

Those tasks will ultimately fall on Sharfsteins successor. In a few years, we might be feeling sorry for that successor if these chronic issues continue to persist, as they have through at least two governors.",nam
359,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has introduced a bill to raise penalties for securities-law violations, seeking to pass legislation that stalled in two previous efforts.

The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act of 2017 would increase the limits on civil fines and expand the ability of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to link the penalty size to how much money is gained by those responsible for a violation, or lost by victims.

This bipartisan bill will enhance the ability of securities regulators to protect investors, deter Wall Street fraud, and punish repeat offenders, said co-sponsor Jack Reed. Investors deserve real protection, and the law needs to change to ensure the punishment fits the crime. This bill gives the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street.

The bill sets maximum fines for the most serious securities violations at whichever is greater: $1 million per violation for individuals, and $10 million per violation for institutions, or three times the money gained in the violation or lost by the victims.

The current fine limits are $181,071 for individuals and $905,353 for firms.

The SEC can now levy a penalty directly linked to the ill-gotten gains only if an enforcement case goes to federal court. The newly proposed legislation would permit the SEC to pursue these larger fines through its administrative process, held before an SEC administrative law judge.

The bill also triples the penalty cap applicable to repeat offenders who have been held liable either criminally or in civil securities fraud cases in the prior five years.

The legislation, dubbed the SEC Penalties Act for short, was sponsored by Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, and Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota.

The goal of this legislation is to create meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent to crack down on fraud, Reed said in a press release announcing the bill.

The proposed legislation has far to go before becoming law but the sponsors expressed optimism. It must first be considered by the Senate Banking Committee.

The Republican chairman of the committee, Mike Crapo, and top Democrat Sherrod Brown welcomed the bipartisan effort. This committee should be discussing ways to strengthen penalties and maximize their deterrent effect, not weaken them, Brown said. In fact, Senator Reed has introduced a bi-partisan bill to enhance civil penalties under the securities laws. . It is bills like that one and others that I hope we can consider this Congress.

Support in the House of Representatives is unclear, as is whether President Donald Trump would eventually sign such a bill into law.

SENDING A MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE AND BI-PARTISANSHIP

Even in todays sharply partisan environment, in which the Republican administration is seeking to deregulate Wall Street and Democrats are fighting to preserve the Dodd-Frank regulatory structure, the bipartisanship shown over the penalties bill may not come as a total surprise.

Politicians and their constituents have had Wall Street in their crosshairs ever since the financial crisis and the industry has been an easy target.

This bill could be low hanging fruit that displays both bipartisan cooperation and determination to crack down on financial crime. However, this will be the third legislative attempt. The measure is essentially identical to efforts introduced in 2012 and 2015 which ultimately failed to become law.

When asked what was different this time, a Reed press aide, This bipartisan bill has not changed and neither has our resolve to protect investors and strengthen oversight and accountability of Wall Street.

It often takes several years to pass meaningful legislation  and well keep at it, the aide said.

In his statement for the Congressional Record (here) Reed said, ""we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will persist.""

Grassley said the SEC needs strong penalties to protect the securities markets from bad actors.

If a fine is just decimal dust for a Wall Street firm, thats not a deterrent, Grassley said. Its just the cost of doing business. A penalty should mean something, and it should get the recidivists attention. I welcome the increased penalties for repeat offenders in this bill. That step should help change the dynamic of business as usual.

Heitkamp said the law would help shield small investors from fraud.

With the SEC coming off a record year of fines (here) totaling more than $4 billion in 548 enforcements in fiscal year 2016, the bar is set high for the agency to surpass the penalty totals. This bill could help keep the fines rolling in.

360,"About 30 fighters were killed in violent clashes between the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and Daesh, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported yesterday.

The two sides have been fighting continuously since the beginning of the month in separate axes in the Syrian desert.

The SOHR stated that the battles are concentrated in the Ithria area in the north-eastern suburbs of Hama and other areas linking the governorates of Aleppo, Raqqa and Hama, where the Syrian army, with the support of Russian air forces, are trying to repel continuous Daesh attacks.

The clashes resulted in the death of 13 Daesh members and 16 SAA soldiers, in addition to a number of regime loyalists.

Though Daesh has largely been defeated in Syria, sleeper cells and small groups of fighters remain in the country and often target oil fields and gas installations.

Since March 2019, the SOHR has recorded the death of more than 900 members of the Syrian army and 140 fighters of its loyalist Iran-backed groups, in addition to 500 Daesh militants during battles in the Badia.",nam
361,"The American Southwest, Brazil, Central America, Caribbean island nations, South Africa, and North Korea are just a few of the places enduring droughts.

Since 1993, the world has celebrated 22 March as World Water Day, a special designation date at risk of drowning amidst others like Lost Sock Memorial Day [9 May], Flip-Flop Day [17 June], or Pluto Demoted Day [24 August].

Water cant afford to slide back into oblivion for the next 364 days. Its too unique. Theres no substitute. Run out of oil? Use gas. Run out of gas? Burn coal. Run out of water? Hmmm

Water security is also too urgent. The fight for clean water is hardly a developing world issue; its universal and demands constant vigilance.

In Flint, Michigan, lead contamination of the tap water has plagued the populace and charted an uncertain future for many children, and the effects are irreversible. This is the precarious knife edge on which water professionals work 24/7/365.

Until 1993, Milwaukee was considered to have an excellent water system. Then the chlorine-resistant parasite Cryptosporidium parvum contaminated Milwaukees drinking water supply, sickening 400,000 people, killing sixty-nine, and becoming the largest documented waterborne disease outbreak in U.S. history. Milwaukees water system has recovered, and Id drink from taps. But it took time.

Beyond challenges of polluted drinking water, the world faces risks from aging water infrastructure; overpumped aquifers, and perhaps the most publicized issue: drought. The American Southwest, Brazil, Central America, Caribbean island nations, South Africa, and North Korea are just a few of the places enduring droughts.

Its all bad news, right? Happily, no.

One aspect of water, dear to my heart, deserves more exposure. It is known as hydrophilanthropy, defined as the altruistic concern for the water, sanitation, and related needs of humankind, as manifested by donations of labor, money, or resources.
Among the best known organizations involved with this endeavor  Water for People, Engineers Without Borders, Rotary International, World Vision; Catholic Charities; U.S. Agency for International Development; Oxfam; WaterAid; Save the Children; Agua Para La Vida; El Porvenir; Lifewater; Living Water  whats impressed me is the number of students who, as a career choice, want to devote much of their lives to learning how to help others help themselves.

362,"Around the world, women in developing economies enjoy less access to the banking system than men.

Bank account opening procedures, especially requirements to produce identity documents, are a major barrier for undocumented women in developing countries. These requirements are mainly aimed at meeting anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing (AML/CTF) obligations. But the barriers may be set unnecessarily high for women given their crime risk profile.

Economic well-being and development is supported by access to formal financial services to save money securely, facilitate the receipt of money sent by family members, insure possessions and responsibly access credit for small business. Yet 38% of adults worldwide  nearly two billion people - still do not have a formal bank account. This exclusion weighs more heavily on women.

Globally 1.1 billion women (55% of unbanked adults) are financially excluded. The gender gap is particularly big in South Asia where only 37% of women have an account compared to 55% of men.

Women face financial, literacy, geographic and social barriers when they wish to open a bank account. It is an onerous process that requires applicants to produce identity verification documents. Women in developing countries often enjoy less access than men to identity documents. Identity document gender gaps have, for instance, been documented in South America, Africa as well as in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries.

Countries like India and Nigeria have introduced innovative large-scale national identity programmes. These programmes are important, but national identification systems dont necessarily ensure equal coverage for women. In Pakistan, for example, women are significantly less likely (79%) to have a national identity card than men (90%).

Without the required documents, women cant open a bank account. There is, however, no clear reason why these identification barriers should be set so high for women.

The real risk

Banks customer identification practices are heavily determined by national AML/CTF regulations. These in turn reflect international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

AML/CTF laws require banks to apply robust customer identification and verification measures to prevent anonymous accounts and identity fraud. Where clients pose a higher crime risk, banks must enhance their due diligence measures, require more information and apply more stringent verification.

New, proportional, risk-based standards adopted by the FATF in 2012 enable countries to allow banks to simplify identification measures where crime risks are lower. For such lower risk clients, banks may dispense with verification of residential addresses where that is a standard requirement. They may also accept a letter from a community leader verifying a persons particulars, rather than insisting on viewing a state-issued document.

Could women be classified as a group of customers that pose a lower crime risk? Compelling statistics suggest so.

Criminality: the gender gap

Criminal justice statistics reflect a distinct criminality gender gap. The International Centre for Prison Studies collects statistics on women in prison. They report that women comprise only 1.5% of prisoners in Pakistan, 2% in Nigeria, 5.1% in Indonesia and 5.3% in Kenya. In fact, the percentage of women in prison is in single digits in nearly 95% of countries globally. Arrest and prosecution rates of women are also significantly lower. Women feature more prominently in only a few types of offences - prostitution, shoplifting, embezzlement and welfare and credit card fraud.

Criminologists are very aware of this gap. A significant body of research focuses on possible explanations for the gap (for example that bias in the criminal justice system may explain a part of the gap), whether or not the gap is narrowing and the few types of offences where the gender gap is small, absent or where women may be in the majority. While the academic analysis and debate continue, the available statistics support the contention that women pose a lesser crime risk than men and that this risk is often significantly lower.

Why do bank practices not reflect this fact? Probably because AML/CTF risk assessments, both at a country and a financial institution level, are on average still relatively crude and because banks may be concerned that a gendered view of clients may be discriminatory.

Improving the system

AML/CTF assessments are generally quite basic. They are often informed by a simplistic understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risk, reflecting mainly anecdotal evidence blended with a measure of common sense. Granular criminal justice statistics, where available, may be considered at a national level but are often not considered by banks in their risk assessments. Banks often lump clients together to avoid accusations of unfair discrimination.

Clients are generally clustered in broad groups such as nationals and foreigners or individuals and corporates, and risk assessments focus mainly on risks arising from the types of products and services such groups may use.

Non-discrimination, however, not only requires the like treatment of those who are alike but also the unlike treatment of those who differ. While gender will generally be an irrelevant consideration for banks, client risk assessments require a consideration of similarities and differences among clients.

Crime patterns differ from country to country and region to region. In some cases women may pose the same or even a higher money laundering or terrorist financing risk to banks. What is required is a reasonable and honest assessment of the available facts and statistics. There is however little evidence that regulators and banks are considering gender-related crime statistics. Ignoring such statistics may unfairly undermine womens financial inclusion.",am
363,"Jose Morales was the early favorite to draw the short straw after Joe Mauer is activated from the 15-day disabled list.

But that was then and this is now.

In the Twins ' past five games, Morales has garnered nine hits in 18 at-bats. He is hitting .361 for the season.

Morales, who was selected by the Twins in the third round of 2001 amateur draft, has accomplished what other more noteworthy Twins, such as Carlos Gomez, Joe Crede, Michael Cuddyer, Delmon Young, Scott Baker, and Francisco Liriano, have failed to do thus far this season. He has not only met expectations, he's exceeded them.

This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who has followed Morales career.

Morales, in parts of eight minor league seasons, sports a .283 batting average. For Triple A-Rochester in 2007 and 2008, Morales batted .312 in 162 games.

The question about Morales has always centered on his defense. He was used at second base, shortstop, and third base in the minor leagues until the Twins decided to groom him as a catcher.

The move has yielded beneficial results, but not enough to dismiss the the reality that Morales is a defensive liability no matter which position he mans.

As a minor league infielder, Morales committed 23 errors in 98 games. As a catcher, Morales committed 41 errors in 334 minor league games. (By comparison, Mauer has only committed 14 errors in 498 Major League games behind the plate).

In 2009, both Redmond and Morales have struggled to keep opposing players from running wild on the base paths. Morales snapped the duo's unenviable streak of allowing 19 consecutive runners to steal a base by throwing out Mark DeRosa Sunday, according to the Associated Press.

Can the Twins really afford to lose his bat from a lineup which has struggled mightily to score runs?

Manager Ron Gardenhire is entertaining the risky proposition of keeping three catchers in the lineup. However, the Twins may not have to go this route if they jettison Redmond, who will turn 38 on May 5, to make room for Mauer.

When Morales isn't spelling Mauer behind the plate, he could be used as a designated hitter or as a part-time infielder. The latter isn't an ideal solution, but it would keep his bat in the lineup, something the Twins desperately need at this point of the season.",nam

Australia has been working with China's ""Operation Fox Hunt"" to snare suspected corrupt officials who have fled overseas or hidden assets offshore. A handful of the 100 top suspects wanted by Beijing are living in Australia.

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the payment demonstrated that Australia was a ""hostile environment for criminals seeking to hide their illegally-obtained assets"".

However, the returned money is tiny compared to the A$4.8 billion in Chinese direct investment into Australia in 2016.

Mr Colvin was in Beijing for talks with the Ministry of Public Security.

The two countries have set up a joint working group to combat financial crime and money-laundering and track down assets linked to the proceeds of crime in both countries. Australian police said the group was the first of its kind with China and would extend the reach of Fox Hunt.

They also plan to formalise future cooperation on a range of crime types, including terrorism, that could impact security in both countries.

369,"NEW YORK, Jan 8 (IFR) - The US commercial mortgage-backed securitisation market is facing a shake-up after new rules clamping down on riskier loan origination spur executives at investment banks to curtail upstart lenders access to their bond issuance platforms.

Regulation AB II, which took hold on November 23, is being seized upon by top Wall Street banks as a reason to prune ties with the less prudent lenders.

Its been simmering below the surface, said one mortgage banker. But now the top 10 guys are going to use their market strength to say: lets eliminate the guys mucking up the market.

The sector has seen a proliferation of new, non-bank lenders in the past four years as private equity and hedge funds chased fatter returns by making loans that big banks avoided in dicey areas of the property market.

Their success to date is reflected by their rapid growth. Some 28 non-bank lenders packaged loans in CMBS transactions in 2015 versus just nine in 2011, according to JP Morgan analysts.

But now the big investment banks are focused on the new rule, which requires that each bond issuer designate a senior officer to certify that all information provided about a transaction is true.

That might sound like a standard sign-off. But bank executives are taking this requirement to heart since it could - for the first time - make them personally liable for securities fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission if sham loans are rolled into their deals.

Its a know-your-counterparty issue, said William OConnor, co-chair of real estate capital markets at law firm Thompson & Knight, explaining that it would take just one bad loan out of a typical CMBS pool of 70 made by different lenders to spell trouble.

For some of the smaller players, that means they are going to have to go elsewhere.

RISE AND FALL

Four years ago, a dozen or so major banks that included Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, dominated more than 90% of the CMBS loan origination business.

But those institutions lost ground to firms operating in the regulatory shadows, and by the end of 2015 their share had dropped to roughly 65%.

Their place was taken by larger non-bank lenders like Cantor Commercial Real Estate, Ladder Capital and Rialto Mortgage Finance, which consistently ranked among the top five contributors of loans in 2015 CMBS deals, according to Wells Fargo data.

It is the smaller players, however, that are expected to be most vulnerable to fallout from Reg AB II.

ON THE SHELF

In light of the regulation, big banks have already begun a more rigorous vetting process to decide which CMBS lending partners they will allow to access their SEC-registered bond issuance shelves.

In 2016, smaller establishments will have less access to the shelves than in the past, said one senior executive at a major non-bank lender, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.

He suggested Wall Street bankers are using the situation event to support their commercial ends.

Its a dog and pony show, he said.

But if you cut off the bottom 15 platforms, its less like cutting off an appendage than it is more of a nuisance.

SAFETY CHECK

Leverage in CMBS deals has increased as around 40 lenders competed for commercial loans in 2015.

Strong lending competition has eroded underwriting quality in conduit CMBS, particularly as more small originators that compete for higher risk borrowers have entered the market, wrote Meghan Kelleher, a CMBS analyst at JP Morgan in the banks 2016 outlook report.

Indeed mortgage debt as a percentage of a propertys estimated value surpassed its pre-crisis peak during 2015.

Moodys calculated the average conduit deals loan-to-value at 118.2% in the fourth quarter, an increase from the prior record of 117.5% in 2007.

Given recent history there are hopes that Reg AB II and other regulations slated to take hold in the next 12 months will help bring more caution to the market.

371,"Today, members of the European Parliament adopted new rules to help fight money laundering and terrorist financing in the EU, one of the key actions in the European Security Agenda presented last month (see IP/15/4865).

V?ra Jourová, the EU's Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, welcomed the vote in Parliament which marked the final adoption of the anti-money laundering package: Serious and organised crime is driven by profit - tracing the illicit proceeds of crime back to the criminal networks is essential both to detect, prosecute and dismantle those networks and to seize and confiscate their criminal wealth. The new anti-money laundering rules adopted today will help us follow the money and crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing.""

The new strengthened European anti-money laundering framework will contribute to the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering by:

facilitating the work of Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money and facilitate the exchange of information;
establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes;
ensuring full traceability of funds transfers within, to and from the European Union.

The Commission will supplement this legislation by working on a supranational assessment of risks. Both texts fully take into account the 2012 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) (see MEMO/12/246), the international standard-setter in the field, and go further on a number of issues to promote the highest standards for anti-money laundering and to counter terrorism financing.

Work must now begin to ensure this framework, which focuses on greater effectiveness and improved transparency, is quickly and effectively put in place. The Commission will work with Member States to speed up the process of implementation of the new Anti-Money Laundering requirements.

On 5 February 2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (IP/13/87) which consists of two legal instruments:

A Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing;
A Regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds to secure ""due traceability"" of these transfers.

The package received the agreement of Ministers in the Council in June 2014 (STATEMENT/14/197). In December 2014, the Parliament and Council reached political agreement on the rules (see news), which was formally endorsed by the Council in February 2015 (see STATEMENT). The Parliament and the Council have adopted the final text.

Following the recent terrorist attacks in Copenhagen, Paris and Brussels, the Council and the Commission agreed to take decisive action against terrorist financing. To enhance the efficiency of the new anti-money laundering rules, the two institutions call for further efforts towards speeding up national implementation of those rules, strengthening cooperation on terrorist financing between the Member States' Financial Intelligence Units, and addressing terrorist financing risks via the EU supranational risk assessment. It is also of utmost importance that coordinated action at international, European and national level to tackle terrorist financing is as effective as possible. The Commission will be examining further actions on countering terrorist financing in the context of implementing the recently adopted European Security Agenda.

The publication of the package in the Official Journal of the EU is due for around June-July 2015. A process to guide Member States in implementing the Directive into national law will be put in place over the coming months (the implementation period is two years).

372,"The peace negotiations in Libya are accompanied by a deluge of resignations. The Prime Minister of the Tobruk Parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, announced his withdrawal last week. And it was only yesterday that the leader of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Sarraj, joined him and resigned his post in the middle of the peace talks.

Sarraj announced in an interview on state television this Wednesday night that he will ""to hand over the tasks of power to the coming executive authority in a time no later than October"". He also urged the High Council's advisory committee to meet and elect a new Presidential Council.

Sarraj's resignation comes amidst a struggle for internal power within the Government of National Accord (GNA) between the circle of the President of the Council and that of the Interior Minister, Fathi Bashaga. Sarraj himself dismissed Bashaga at the beginning of September and opened an investigation into him because of the violent repression of social protests by one of the militias linked to the ministry of the interior. These sanctions were short-lived, as the minister was released only three days later and returned to his post, from which he controls the security of Tripoli, the headquarters of the GNA.

The search for a substitute prime minister is urgent, as talks resume in Morocco next week to negotiate peace in the Libyan conflict. Sarraj has headed the Government of National Accord since the establishment of the executive in March 2016, together with President Khaled al-Mecrhi, following the failed peace process promoted by the UN in the Moroccan city of Skhirat.

The Libyan country has been divided since the 2011 Arab Spring riots. After the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi, nine years of conflict and divisions have left the Libyan population in a state of anxiety. The energy, economic and health crises are weighing on citizens who have been marching in the streets since August against the two opposing governments.

Libya currently has two governments: the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, and the eastern parliament of Tobruk, created in 2014 and associated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Marshal Khalifa Haftar.

In early September the two sides reached an agreement on the need to agree on ""major commitments"" to end the conflict in Libya, as they announced after the first contact in Bouznika, Morocco. The list of commitments to be followed is not yet known, though the main aim is to secure a definitive ceasefire. The dialogue committees are made up of seven people and will soon announce the first agreements for a peaceful solution in Libya.

The civil war has been raging in the North African country since 2014 and has become an international war scenario involving different foreign powers with different interests on the ground. Haftar's LNA is supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France; meanwhile, the LNA receives military support from Turkey and financial support from Qatar, and has been recognised by the United Nations (UN) since 2016.

Unexpected changes during the peace negotiations

Throughout the week there has been speculation in Libya about the possible resignation of Prime Minister Sarraj. The Bloomerg agency announced two days ago that the leader was considering resigning. No one seemed willing to believe it until yesterday, when Sarraj himself confirmed his resignation during prime-time television.

As a result, the interests and representatives who are leading the peace talks have been turned upside down. The dialogues are in the focus of the international community and currently Russia and Turkey are highly influential in these agreements. For their part, the European Union and the United Nations wish to regain the leadership of the negotiations and, following this resignation, it seems to be more complicated.

As part of this effort, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of the international mission to Libya (UNSMIL) on Tuesday and announced it will fill the vacancy left by its latest special envoy, Ghassam Saleme, in the coming days. Moscow and Cairo support the aspirations of Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognised leader of the executive in eastern Libya and a strong military figure in the country. Following the resignation of the prime minister of the Tobruk parliament, Abdullah al-Zani, both Brussels and the UN are attempting to extol the political figure of Aguilah Saleh Issa, president of the parliament elected in 2014.

The Tobruk Parliament was established in 2014 to replace the Libyan National General Congress after the death of Muammar al-Qadhafi and has control over western Libya.

Libyans no longer want instability

The precarious situation in the country has sparked off the anger of the population. In recent months thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest against both governments. The main demands of the mobilisations are the holding of elections, a social reform package and gas, fuel and running water shortages. Besides, a solution to the energy problem causing constant power cuts in the biggest cities is needed.

In this scenario, Human Right Watch organization has denounced the arbitrary detention of 24 demonstrators in the capital by several armed groups, including a journalist reporting on these protests, beating some of them and using several weapons to disperse the demonstrators. Several armed militias have also been known to take to the streets to clear the marches. The violence escalated until demonstrators in Benghazi stormed and set fire to the East Libyan government headquarters and attacked the city hall. In addition, at least five people have been injured by shots fired by LNA members in the town of Al Marj.

The protests began in Tripoli, Misrata and Zawiyah on August 23, t hanks to a newly formed student movement called Harak Al-Shabab 23/08 that took to the streets to criticise both the eastern and western authorities""for the unbearable living conditions"" in the country.

Both Sarraj and Aguilah Saleh announced a ceasefire commitment a fortnight ago, but it has not been accepted by the military forces on the ground. The opposing armies continue to reinforce and move troops between the oasis of Al Jufrah and the port of Sirte, the new battle front in a war that intensified 14 months ago with the entry of mercenaries-mainly Syrians and Africans-recruited by Turkey and Russia.

Libya has been on the list of failed states since 2011, its population is tired and struggling to get out each day in a country devastated by armed conflict. The civil war is also compounded by the largest refugee crisis on the African continent.

thousands of people cross through the country seeking to reach Europe, most of them are kidnapped by the trafficking mafias and find themselves in detention centres, extorted and forced to work to pay for a ""pass"" to get a plastic boat with no guarantees.

373,"Its a sorely needed effort. Black households are almost twice as likely not to have any stock-market investments, according to a recent study. Ten percent of Black investors said their investments would fare worse than stock-market averages in the coming 12 months, nearly twice the level of pessimism displayed by white investors.

Theres a long, troubling history behind these investing imbalances, and Rogers knows it personally.

His great-grandfather, J.B. Stradford, owned a Tulsa hotel that was destroyed during the citys 1921 race massacre. When Stradford fled to Chicago, his sons legal skills blocked the businessmans extradition to Tulsa and, he said, likely prevented a lynching. But things werent the same after that for Stradford, whose wealth and status were reduced to ashes.

Stradfords story has deep meaning for Rogers, but he knows there are too many tales of a step forward for Black wealth followed by a step back. And thats what brings Rogers, the chairman, co-CEO and chief investment officer of the $12 billion asset-management firm, back to financial literacy and economic justice.

Rogers, who also sits on the board of directors at McDonalds MCD, +0.04%, Nike NKE, -0.96% and The New York Times Company NYT, -1.54%, spoke to MarketWatch earlier this month to discuss his family history and what financial literacy can and cant accomplish. He also discussed how boardroom Jackie Robinson moments, and rethinking retirement-savings policies and business nuts and bolts like supplier contracts, can narrow the wealth gap.

MarketWatch: From a wealth standpoint, what did it mean for your family when your great-grandfathers business, the Stradford hotel, was destroyed nearly a century ago?

Rogers: It was heartbreaking, and my understanding is when he came to Chicago and tried to recreate his entrepreneurial success that he had in Tulsa, he just couldnt quite get it done. So he was crushed, I think; psychologically crushed. Never able to have the status and the wealth that he had enjoyed in Tulsa. And I think it had a debilitating impact on our family.

Of course, theres no opportunity to have multi-generational wealth, no opportunity to pass down wealth from one generation to another when you go through the kind of crisis that he had. And then with my father, my grandfather, my mom being lawyers back then, you couldnt work for a big law firm downtown. You had to work for other African Americans.

My grandfather was very involved in the Lorraine Hansberry family case that fought the redlining that was going on here in the Chicago area. It went to the Supreme Court and he was able to use his legal skills there again to fight for economic justice and fairness when it came to the historic segregation that was here.

But we never were able to kind of create the wealth that traditional lawyers would have working for big law firms with big clients that could pay big legal fees.

MarketWatch: You started getting stocks at age 12. When your father bought that stock for you, how much of that was linked to what happened in Tulsa, and the idea of building up wealth and starting over?

Rogers: I think it could have been indirectly. My dad was a Tuskegee Airman. He met my mom in law school. He was Class of 48 and I wasnt born until 1958, 10 years later, so he had a lot of time to plan for me. At age 16, youre going to have a summer job, and I became a vendor at Wrigley Field and Sox Park. Youre going to have a checking account at a certain age, savings account, etcetera.

But he always told the story that he was having a conversation with a white lawyer here in Chicago. They got into a conversation about the fact that African Americans were not invested in the stock market, and that was a problem. And this white gentleman told my father, Well, in your community, you in the African-American community, you should know as much about the stock market as my 12-year-old son does, because I buy stocks for him every birthday and every Christmas.

So my father vowed that when I got to be 12, I was going to have that same exposure to the stock market that the white gentlemans son had. And so that was kind of the inspiration for him to put me through that process.

MarketWatch: As youve built Ariel Investments, financial literacy is just so much a part of the stated mission and culture. And, of course, theres your own resume and career. Why is financial literacy so important to you?

Rogers: Im really channeling my dad, because I found that as I started my career as a stockbroker at William Blair I quickly realized that my white friends that I had gone to high school with and college, they were always familiar with the markets. They became my early customers. Some of them had money from their bar mitzvah, money from their holidays. They learned about the markets from their parents, their grandparents. They were totally comfortable buying and selling.

My Black friends  even those that came from professional families, doctors, lawyers, what have you, academics  they had no knowledge of the market, and when they came to see me, I was sort of showing them something, and teaching them something they had no exposure to.

So I realized that when I got started in my career, I just felt a responsibility to take my dads values and try to do what I could to expose African Americans, particularly, to the stock market: Go and speak at churches in the Black community. Go and speak to students in lower school and middle school and high school; try to get interviewed in Black publications to talk to people about the importance of saving and investing, the magic of compound interest.

I felt I should pay it forward by exposing as many people to the markets as possible because I just believe its a wonderful thing to be able to compound money as you lived your life and built your career.

MarketWatch: Too little financial literacy is a problem in many places. But why is it that especially so in the Black community?

Rogers: Whenever we got a step ahead, we got pulled back down: Jim Crow laws, historic discrimination that we faced, the lack of education in our communities  all those extraordinary challenges. We know that we were supposed to get 40 acres and a mule after the Civil War. And after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, the new president wasnt interested in that. We really went backwards every step of the way. Whenever we made progress, something would come back and pull us down again. So, because of the historical racism we faced in this country, we never had the chance to generate wealth. We never had a chance to build multigenerational wealth.

So you get comfortable in the markets if you have some money to invest in the markets, and you have parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who had wealth and invested in the markets, and they can help pass along not only their inheritances, but their knowledge of the markets and understanding of the markets.

But when you have families who are living month to month and taking care of extended families because of the historical discrimination we face in this country, were just not going be comfortable in the markets. Its a foreign concept. If you didnt get comfortable with it at an early age and then all of a sudden start, if you begin to make a little bit of money, its a whole new thing that youre not going to be naturally comfortable with. The volatility is going to be something thats hard to live with, without people you can trust who can make you be comfortable and help you be comfortable.

And so inevitably what happens is, we found in research with Charles Schwab SCHW, +3.24% and others over the years, is that African Americans are much more comfortable investing in tangible real estate. Which, of course, is problematic if you live in a segregated city like Chicago  because you end up buying property and parts of the city that dont grow and thrive, and you dont have the same kind of wealth-creation vehicle for your real-estate investments.

But theres a lot more comfort investing in real estate. Also, were comfortable investing in insurance products. This risk aversion thats developed in our community shows up again in investing in real estate and insurance products.

MarketWatch: You mentioned segregation and redlining earlier. When were talking about narrowing the wealth gap, how much can a financially literate mind set accomplish when there are so many other external headwinds?

Rogers: Youre exactly right. Financial literacy can only do so much. We feel strongly that public schools should be teaching young people about the stock market and teaching them about investing. And we started the Ariel Community Academy over 25 years ago to help teach kids at this one public school in Chicago about the markets by giving them real money to invest in real stocks, the way that my dad did.

So financial literacy helps not only in kids learning at an early age about investing and savings, but they also learn about financial-services careers that can be so lucrative. And we think it prepares them to be better entrepreneurs if they get exposed to financial literacy at an early age, learning how to budget and all the things necessary to start a business.

But I do think, when I talk to parents about how can you create wealth for your families. I tell them the most important thing is to get your child into the appropriate studies that will allow them to be qualified to work in the parts of the economy where the wealth and the jobs are being created today.

And most people in our community, because of the discrimination we face, we dont know about hedge funds, we dont know about private equity. We dont know much about venture capital. We dont know about the enormous wealth that is created by these parts of the economy that have just sort of sprung up. If we want to bring wealth to our communities, we have to get our young people exposed to the markets at an early age so they can get career paths that will lead them to the right places.

At the same time, these private-equity firms and hedge funds and venture-capital firms have to start getting out of their comfort zone and stop only hiring people that look like them and hiring from their own communities in our segregated society. We have to hold these institutions accountable.

Pension funds hire private-equity firms; family offices do, universities and hospitals and foundations do. If all those anchor institutions in our community told their private-equity managers and their hedge-fund managers and their venture-capital managers that they had to have staff that looked like America and they had to have leaders in those organizations that look like America, I guarantee you, they would find that talent once the customers asked and insisted on it.

MarketWatch: I want to hear more about the private sector, but first I want to hear more about the public sector: Are there any regulations or tax-code changes or laws that could be changed in order to help close the wealth gap?

Rogers: I was very fortunate during the Obama administration to chair his Council for Financial Capability for Young Americans, and one of the suggestions we gave the president at the end was that we would hope that the government would encourage financial institutions to partner with urban schools in the way that we have. The federal government cant mandate it, but I think that would go a long way.

If all the major financial institutions in this country, small, mid-sized and large, did what weve done with the Ariel Community Academy, you would have a whole different story out there. It would be an amazing success story.

I think the second thing the government can do is follow whats happening in Australia. Australia has the best kind of Social Security on steroids where they allow all citizens to create wealth and, over a long period of time, have money put aside for their retirement benefits.

[The government can] put tax incentives in place to bring back defined-benefit plans. Right now, all the regulatory and tax law incentivizes corporations  strongly incentivizes corporations  to get out of the pension-fund business, and replace it with the 401(k) business.

And thats especially debilitating for Black and brown folks coming along, who are not as familiar with the markets. So theyre going to, of course, get into the 401(k) late and theyre going to get in and out, sell their securities at the wrong time. When the markets are panicking, theyre going to panic. Theyre going to also be more likely to take hardship withdrawals or loans from their 401(k) plans. All those things conspire for people of color to be able to not have the kind of retirement they deserve.

It would be wonderful if the government could intervene backwards, and go back to the way it used to be, where the incentives for corporations were in line to have strong pension plans. It was meaningful and material and made all the difference.

I was on a call with [BlackRock BLK, -0.81% chairman and CEO] Larry Fink. Hes talked a lot about this, and he was saying he didnt understand why the press, why the presidential candidates, why congressional leadership wasnt focused on this issue of the future of retirement income for Americans. And I made the point to Larry that its much worse for people of color. This is a crisis for everyone, but its a super crisis for folks of color.

MarketWatch: Now getting to the private sector, and boardrooms in specific. Youve been on both sides: You sit on some boards and in Ariel Investments, you encourage boardrooms to become more diverse. Why do you do that and what have the results been?

Rogers: We can point to now over 45 instances where we have caused a corporation to have what we call a Jackie Robinson moment, and have their first diverse board member. So were really quite proud of that, from Sothebys BID, +0.78% to Jones Lang LaSalle JLL, -2.53%.

When we talk to these companies, we tell them, Were one of your bigger shareholders, we believe in you, we think youre going to be a great business. But if your management team and your board looks like a 1940s company, its hard for us to have confidence in you as an investment. We want a company that looks like a 21st-century company that cares about these issues but understands that if you search for diverse talent, youre going to have a stronger team.

Theres a lot of research that shows diverse perspectives lead to better decision making. And, of course, when you have diverse leadership youre going to have better understanding of your diverse customer base. And thats really, really important.

As the country gets more and more diverse, if you dont do this well, youre just going to get further and further and further behind. And your competitors that get it will race ahead of you because they are going to have better talent, deeper talent and better connections with their customer base.

I know sometimes people think were a pain in the ass, because we keep plugging them and plugging them, and pushing them and pushing them. But if a company doesnt get it, then at some point we may have to decide were going to sell.

Under the leadership of our ESG team, we are going to be keeping track of this and then voting against directors a year out if they have not had that Jackie Robinson moment.

MarketWatch: To what extent can ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance] investing close the racial wealth gap?

Rogers: I always use the example of the University of Chicago, where Ive been a long time trustee, close to 20 years. We were talking about the fact that at the time when Bob Zimmer became president and, at some point, realized I was the only Black trustee there out of 60 trustees.

We were having lunch or breakfast, and I said, Bob, if every progressive institution like University of Chicago never works with minority-owned companies or asks the majority companies to have minority leaders in their relationship with the university, how do you expect us to create the wealth and stature to qualify to be on the board? He said, Every once in a while, someone helps you think about a new way to solve a difficult problem. And so Johns done that for me.

Theres now over 95 companies that are doing business with the University of Chicago  professional services, financial services, technology, et cetera  that werent 11 years ago.

Theres some other institutions in town doing great work like that. Northern Trust NTRS, +1.15%, McDonalds, Exelon EXC, -0.76% have been absolutely fantastic.

But those are sort of the exceptions, really, that have really made a true commitment. Im sure there are some others out there, and some others out there nationally. But too often, the economic opportunities are not open for people of color, even today. And, you know, as Dr. [Martin Luther] King said, many well-meaning white Americans deplore prejudice, but accept or ignore economic injustice.

And we continue to see that in our country today.

MarketWatch: What did the Paycheck Protection Program in the CARES Act and the money it distributed to Black-owned businesses show about the wealth gap, and race and business?

Rogers: It was much harder for Black and brown businesses to get access to that vitally needed capital in the heart of the pandemic.

We didnt have the relationships with the banks. We just did not get the opportunities to save our businesses the way that the majority community did. So I think thats part of this whole financial-literacy issue; its part of this whole relationship. Again, segregation, discrimination. Implicit, unconscious bias is still out there where people think that were not worthy of the loans and the opportunities that PPP brought forth.

The second thing thats really important, and I think its not been talked enough about, is the disproportionate amount of Black and brown businesses that are in the parts of the economy where the pandemic hurt them the worst.

If youre in construction and catering, janitorial services, low-margin businesses to start with, youre out of business when the pandemic hits. If youre in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital or lawyers, accountants  theyre able to work from home. Many are doing as well or better, financially, than before the pandemic hit.

And so, again, this historical discrimination of not allowing us in parts of the economy where wealth is being created, that exacerbated and magnified dramatically during this pandemic.

MarketWatch: In the wake of George Floyds killing, corporate America pledged a lot of money toward racial justice. How much of that is lip service and PR versus a genuine effort?

Rogers: I think theres a lot of well-meaning corporations in this case that mean well and start with philanthropy. Thats important, and [Ariel Investments co-CEO and president] Mellody Hobson would say thats important, but we cant let that be the end-all and be-all. Because we dream of a day when African-American entrepreneurs can create their own philanthropy, not have to go to white America for all the support.

Theres a lot of pride that comes when we can support our own communities through our own wealth-building activities and our own leadership activities in things that we built, like what happened at Tulsa, where you had a strong Black business community and had strong Black churches, had strong Black philanthropy.

We need to get back to that. Its a good thing they are doing this, but we cant allow them to feel like theyve checked that box; theyre really the good guys now because theyve given more money this year to historically Black colleges or civil-rights organizations and community organizations.

Thats all good. I mean, thats great. Most importantly, though, theyve got to make sure they are hiring people within their own organization at the highest ranks, and they are bringing people of color into the C-suite, into leadership roles, and that they are spending money with minority businesses and minority entrepreneurs and minority business leaders so that we can, again, build our own wealth.

We need access to capital, but we need access to customers. So I always give the example of McDonalds: Not only do they have over 200 Black-owned franchisees in this country  theyre all multi-millionaires, for the most part, real wealth  they also, over the years, have worked to establish many, many large suppliers to McDonalds.

If you look at the Black Enterprise list of top 100 companies, when you drill down to the top 20 companies, five of the top Black-owned companies in the country are McDonalds suppliers. If you have McDonalds buying anything from croutons to ice-cream toppings to sausages from your business, youre not going to have any problem getting capital from the banks to build and grow your business. That is the model we would hope that corporate America could follow.

MarketWatch: Theres just so much going in the world right now. How hopeful are you that the wealth gap will close, between improved financial literacy, government intervention, improved hiring practices in the private sector, all these things?

Rogers: Im more optimistic than I was a year ago. I think it is the silver lining coming out of all this tragedy and the horrific murder of George Floyd and all the challenge we face: Im finding that more company CEOs seem very sincere about working with Black-owned businesses and getting more Black leadership into their C-suites and into their boards. Im seeing more non-profits, the anchor institutions in our community, more interested in doing the same thing.

Im seeing more progressive politicians who understand business getting elected to Congress, getting elected to local offices. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Joyce Beatty (D., Ohio), chairman of the subcommittee on diversity and inclusion, theyre driving change to the institutions that they regulate and oversee.

So for those reasons, Im optimistic. Corporations seem to be in a better place; business leadership seems to be in a better place. And they are getting pushed along by more progressive political leaders. I think we have hope that this can be something that can be a long-lasting change for our society.",nam
374,"As the UEFA European Championship kicks off in France, the memory of last Novembers terrorist attacks on the Stade de France and other venues across Paris looms large. French authorities will be examining the previous attacks  including the January 2015 shootings at Charlie Hebdo  to secure the tournament against any terrorist threat. Even if that means disappointing fans by shutting down Marseilles famous beaches.

To start with, authorities will be thinking carefully about what kinds of attacks are possible. Both the Paris and Hebdo attacks were made using small arms. Such attacks are popular with terrorist groups, because they are relatively easy to plan and carry out, can cause a high number of casualties and effectively spread terror throughout the population. Its very likely that security forces will be preparing for the potential of a similar style of attack.

Authorities will also be wary of potential attacks by suicide bombers, like the one witnessed in Brussels earlier this year. Suicide bomb attacks are frequently used by Islamist-inspired groups, and can be carried out in different ways. Individuals may wear home-made bomb vests, or drive vehicles with explosives into places where many people have gathered.

Of course, bombs can also be planted in specific locations. But static bombs are easier to deal with than suicide bombers, as areas and stadiums can be swept for these devices. Whats more, entrances to stadiums will be tightly controlled, with strict security requirements, similar to the London 2012 Olympics.

Authorities will also be considering how to police more accessible areas like the fan zones and host cities, as these places will attract thousands of supporters on any given day throughout the tournament. France is already on high security alert, having maintained its state of emergency since November, so many of the locations linked to the tournament will be hard for terrorists to penetrate.

Attacks like the ones weve witnessed in Europe recently are not easy to carry out  they require planning, and a support network. Of course, this does not stop individuals from launching rogue attacks, like the one at [Leytonstone Tube station](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789) in December 2015.

But while such attacks can cause casualties  as seen in Munich last month  they cannot have the same impact as well-planned, well-resourced attacks. And fans attending the tournament can take comfort from the recent arrest of a French man who was caught transporting weapons, reportedly in order to launch an attack on the tournament.

France is deploying 90,000 police and security personnel to protect citizens. They are likely to be deployed at strategic locations, and no doubt briefed on what to look for. This can include potential terrorist suspects, which intelligence reports have highlighted as possible threats, or keeping an eye out for behaviour that looks out of the ordinary. Security cordons will also be strategically placed to maximise safety and security.

Intelligence will also play a major part in the security operation. On June 7, 2016, Europol  the EUs law enforcement agency  announced that it was directing 200 of its staff to assist French policing agencies and ensure the rapid exchange of any relevant information.

Contingency plans

The French will also be developing contingency plans, based on which responses worked  and which didnt  during the Paris and Brussels attacks. Police and emergency services will have carefully planned a series of responses, tailored to the type of attacks that are likely to occur. This will include ensuring the tactics deployed by police firearms units are suitable to address specific threats, and identifying suitable evacuation zones where people can stay safely and the injured can be treated in the event of an attack.

When attending the games themselves, supporters will be encouraged to get to the stadium well ahead of time, as the security procedure will be strict and time consuming. Further security checks on public transport systems such as the Metro are also likely. People should not be overly concerned about the large police presence; officers are there to keep them safe, as well as deal with any violence from rival supporters. The French government has also released a mobile app to alert the public in the event of a terrorist attack.

The threat of a terrorist attack is real. As the Provisional IRA said during the Irish Troubles: the state has to be lucky 100% of the time, the terrorist only once. But when you consider the proportion of attacks which have been prevented, the likelihood of one occurring is still remote.",nam
375,"U.S. anti-money laundering regulations are well-developed, and domestic coordination to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing is sophisticated and has improved over the past 10 years, according to a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) evaluation issued Thursday.

The FATF is an independent intergovernmental body that promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing.

In the first evaluation of the U.S. regulatory system undertaken by the FATF since 2006, the report states that the U.S. regulatory framework has made significant progress since the previous assessment and states that the United States effectively investigates and prosecutes money laundering and terrorist financing.

The FATFs report also states that under the Bank Secrecy Act, U.S. financial institutions have an evolved understanding of money laundering risks. Financial sectors bear most of the burden in combating money laundering in the United States, and the evaluation found that financial institutions have systems and processes for implementing preventive measures, including onboarding of customers, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious transactions.

The evaluation did note some gaps in U.S. anti-money laundering regulations. FATF guidelines call for member governments to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities and oversight over practicing accountants in firms as well as lawyers, casino operators, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones, and other independent legal professionals.

The United States has not adopted the FATF recommendation to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities over these professions. In the case of the accounting profession, the money-laundering provisions in the Bank Secrecy Act do not separately regulate accountants. But accountants working for financial institutions covered by the Bank Secrecy Act are subject to the anti-money laundering requirements imposed on those entities.

Nonetheless, the FATF cited gaps in U.S. regulations, including:

Minimal coverage of certain institutions and businesses.
Minimal measures imposed on certain nonfinancial businesses and professions. The FATF found that casinos are the only one of a number of key sectors in the United States outside of financial services/banking that are required to report suspicious transactions. Professionals who are not subject to sufficient anti-money laundering regulations include accountants, investment advisers, lawyers, real estate agents, and certain trust company and service providers, according to the FATF.
Lack of access to adequate, accurate, and current beneficial ownership information. This inability to determine the true owner of a company, such as a shell company, creates opportunities for money launderers to hide illicit proceeds, according to the FATF.
Lack of a uniform approach to state-level anti-money laundering efforts. The FATF reported that it is not clear that all states devote enough priority to preventing and detecting money laundering.",nam

(Russian: ?????? ???????? ????????, Ukrainian: ?????? ???????? ????????; Leonid Ivanovych Pasichnyk; born 15 March 1970) is the leader of the self-proclaimed state Luhansk People's Republic [1] [2] [3] [4]

Biography

Pasechnik's father worked in law enforcement, [4] for the OBKhSS, for 26 years. [3] [4] In 1975 the Pasechnik family moved to Magadan in the Russian Far East [4] where Pasechnik's father was associated with gold mine operations. [3]

Pasechnik graduated the Donetsk Military-Political College and worked for the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Luhansk Oblast as a chief of a detachment combating contraband operations [4] and the chief of the Stakhanov district detachment. [3] On 15 August 2006 he became famous for intercepting large quantities of contraband at Izvaryne border checkpoint ($1.94 mln and 7.24 mln Russian rubles), at the same time refusing a bribe out of principle. [3] [4]

In March 2007 SBU Lieutenant Colonel Pasechnik received from the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko a medal For Military Service to Ukraine, ""for showing integrity and professionalism in the line of duty"". [3]

In 2014 he sided with pro-Russian militants, becoming on 9 October 2014 a minister of State Security for the self-proclaimed state Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). [3] [4]

On 21 November 2017, armed men in unmarked uniforms took up positions in the center of Luhansk in what appeared to be a power struggle between the head of the republic Igor Plotnitsky and the (sacked by Plotnitsky) LPR appointed interior minister Igor Kornet. [5] [6] Three days later the website of the separatists stated that Plotnitsky had resigned ""for health reasons. Multiple war wounds, the effects of blast injuries, took their toll."" [7] The website stated that Pasechnik had been named acting leader ""until the next elections."" [7] Russian media reported that Plotnitsky had fled the unrecognised republic on 23 November 2017 to Russia. [8] On 25 November the 38-member People's Council of the LPR unanimously approved Plotnitsky's resignation. [9] Pasechnik declared his adherence to the Minsk accords, claiming ""The republic will be consistently executing the obligations taken under these agreements."" [10] On 30 March 2018 Pasechnik stated ""Our [LPR] experience can help all regions of Ukraine eventually gain freedom and independence, and then we can together declare a new Ukraine in which representatives of different nationalities and cultures will freely live."" [11] (While meeting people living in territory controlled by LPR in the summer of 2019) Pasechnik stated: ""It does not mean, that we will return back into Ukraine. This is the only way to stop this madness, this war. You should understand that we, as a sovereign state will be a state within the state  that will be our special status"". [12]

378,"Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott is open to holding dialogue with a group of league football players who are threatening to boycott the 2020 football season, according to a letter that Scott sent the group Monday. Sports Illustrated obtained a copy of the two-page letter, which Scott wrote in response to the #WeAreUnited campaigns letter Sunday.

Pac-12 officials are reviewing #WeAreUniteds list of demands and documents, Scott says in the 1,400-word response, sent at 7 p.m. ET Monday. We are eager to hear more about your concerns and very happy to discuss, Scott writes. I will come back to you in the coming days following discussion with our members and student-athlete leaders to schedule a call for this week to discuss the matters that you have raised.

A Pac-12 spokesman declined comment Monday evening when contacted about the letter.

Sports Illustrated also obtained a copy of the email that #WeAreUnited sent to Scott on Sunday, detailing its demands and requesting daily Zoom meetings with Scott, Pac-12 athletic directors and the #WeAreUnited player representative team. The group requested the Zoom meetings begin Monday evening. We believe a football season under these conditions would be reckless and put us at needless risk, their email to Scott reads. The lack of regard for our health and safety is central to the systemic racial injustices imposed by NCAA sports that disproportionately exploits Black athletes physically, academically, and financially.

The letter was signed by 11 players, each from a different league school. The only program not represented was the University of Colorado. Scott addressed his response to the 11 players: Dallas Hobbs, Washington State; Cody Shear, Arizona State; Jaydon Grant, Oregon State; Valentino Daltoso, Cal; Chase Williams, USC; Elijah Higgins, Stanford; Jevon Holland, Oregon; Joe Tryon, Washington; Malik Hausman, Arizona; Nick Ford, Utah; and Otito Ogbonnia, UCLA.

The health of athletes is the leagues No. 1 priority, Scott writes in his letter. For this reason we have made clear on July 10 that that any student-athlete who chooses not to return to competition for health or safety reasons will have their scholarship protected and will remain in good standing with their team. We support any student-athlete who chooses to opt out for health and safety reasons.

In regard to many of the players demands, Scott cites multiple initiatives that the Pac-12 has championed over the years, including the Pac-12s policy for (1) providing medical care for athletes four years beyond their eligibility, which is twice as many years of coverage as any other major conference, the letter says; (2) allowing any former player to use the remainder of their scholarship to return to campus to complete a degree; (3) against schools canceling scholarships because of poor performance; and (4) to require schools to have mental health services available to all athletes.

The letter also cites the unlimited meals that Pac-12 schools provide their athletes. The league supports two initiatives important to the #WeAreUnited group, Scott's letter states, including a modification of the transfer rule to allow players to play immediately and the passage of a uniform legislation to allow players to profit from their name, image and likeness. No Pac-12 school is requiring athletes to sign a liability waiver to begin workouts, Scott writes in the letter.

He also touches on the Black Lives Matter movement across the country, one that has filtered into college sports. The Pac-12 has a long history of supporting student-athlete voices and initiatives on social justice, he writes. On July 1, the Pac-12 announced a series of next steps to combat racism and support social justice, including (i) a newly-created head of diversity & inclusion position at the Conference, (ii) the formation of a social justice & anti-racism advisory group that includes student-athlete representatives, and (iii) the launch of series of student-athlete & coach anti-racism forums.",nam
379,"KINGSTON, Jamaica (JIS)  United States (US) Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno, says the US Mission in Jamaica is working closely with local stakeholders to curb financial crimes and boost regulatory compliance of financial institutions.
This is in response to the threat of international correspondent banks cutting ties with local and regional financial institutions in a move to eliminate risk of crimes such as money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.
Moreno, addressing the final day of the fifth Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Conference at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel on Tuesday, said his Mission recognises the critical nature of correspondent banking relationships to the local economy.
As such, he said the embassy is seeking to help local partners build capacity, increase transparency and comply with the regulatory framework of the US.
We have mutual interest in fighting the scourge. We are partners in this effort; and together, through more dialogue and action, we can combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism without sacrificing the important correspondent banking relationships, Moreno said.
He noted that the US Embassy has offered training in best practices to law-enforcement, prosecutors and other stakeholders on how to combat financial crimes.
They also provide training to investigators at the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) and the Financial Investigations Division (FID) and help in criminal investigations that lead to money-laundering charges.
Moreno said the Embassy has also trained regulators in non-financial sectors, such as realtors, accountants and attorneys, as well as professionals from the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission and the Casino Gaming Commission in developing sound practices to ensure risk of money laundering and terrorism financing are understood, identified and reported.
We work with our counterparts, law enforcement and regulatory, to develop and share money-laundering and terrorism-financing methods and trends, he said.
The US Embassy also has an ongoing Jamaica Operations Linked to Telemarketing (JOLT) Task Force designed to facilitate identification, investigation and prosecution of telemarketers who victimise US and Jamaican citizens.
Deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism are a few drivers of de-risking that jurisdictions can address. It is essential that countries and their financial institutions work to improve their controls, and its also important that they publicise the efforts in an increasingly risk-averse economic climate, he said.
He said the US Government is working to develop appropriate policy responses to advance the objective of combating financial crimes, while also providing and promoting financial inclusion.
Correspondent banking involves a bank in one country facilitating certain services for a financial institution in another country, including wire transfers, business transactions, deposits and gathering of documents.
Over the last five years, a number of international banks have restricted or ended their relationship with the region due to concerns about money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing.
The two-day Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism Conference, to facilitate discussion on strengthening compliance, was hosted by the Jamaica Bankers Association (JBA) and the Jamaica Institute of Financial Services (JIFS), under the theme Understanding our obligations Safeguarding our Future.",nam

How does 4AMLD change the compliance landscape?
How well are banks fighting financial crime today? Where are the gaps  in terms of technology and processes?
How big a challenge is compliance with 4AMLD?
What are the options for smaller and newer financial institutions? What is the fastest, cheapest route to compliance?
How do the regulators view outsourcing of compliance activities to third parties?
How can larger institutions turn the challenge of compliance into an opportunity to gain a holistic view?
What are the key technologies banks can leverage for compliance  from cloud to data to analytics?
How well served are the different industry players by solutions and services for financial crime compliance?
Whats next? How can banks ensure the efforts they make to comply with current regulation stand them in good stead to achieve compliance in the environment of the future?",nam
381,"I recently read an eye-opening report titled Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States by Richard Gordon, an American law professor who served on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Task Force on Terrorism Finance following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The report revealed that suspicious financial transactions could be noted in more than a dozen terrorism-related prosecutions which were analyzed as part of a comprehensive study of terrorism financing for the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF). This jarring reality compelled me to share a few highlights from these cases (discussed later in this article) as they explicitly underline how immensely important it is for financial institutions to be diligent and vigilant in their monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity.

This sentiment was very strongly voiced by the Director of FinCEN last month in a speech which focused on terrorist financing and the important fact that BSA reports filed by financial institutions can identify suspicious activity which may ultimately prove to be related to the funding of terrorism. This stance was also endorsed by renowned counter-terrorism expert Richard Barrett at a congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing last week. Mr. Barrett testified that Suspicious Activity Reports filed by financial institutions may provide possible indicators of terrorist planning worthy of investigation. I have included some brief snippets from these commentaries and others below.

Finally, Ive concluded this article with 58 red flag indicators for terrorist financing from four different sources. I opted to provide readers with the original lists as compiled by these sources rather than remove redundant indicators and consolidate into a single list since the nuances of the different wording provides more detail or specifics in some cases for the noted indicators.

Director of FinCEN shares that 18% of the FBIs international terrorism cases in 2014 had related BSA filings and urges financial institutions continued vigilance and support.

A few weeks ago, the Director of FinCEN, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, made terrorist financing the theme of her speech at an anti-money laundering seminar for bankers. Director Calvery informed the attendees that The reporting your institutions provide has already proven to be an essential component in identifying foreign terrorist fighters, their financial facilitators, and the flow of funds and she urged financial institutions continued vigilance and support. She provided statistics that FinCEN processes about 50,000 new filings each day and that automated business rules related to ISIL, alone, generate over 800 matches each month for further review and exploitation. She added that Foreign terrorist fighters may use an ATM, a money services business (MSB), or a depository institution to send or receive funds to facilitate travel to Iraq and Syria. Director Calvery stressed that there is no doubt at FinCEN, or amongst our partners across government, that the reporting your financial institutions provide is essential to our efforts to disrupt, degrade, and ultimately defeat al-Qaida, ISIL and other terrorist groups. As Juan Zarate, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism so aptly put it  Money is their [terrorist groups] enabler, but its also their Achilles heel.

Sample Case Highlights  Credit Card Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud and Money Laundering Structuring

One noteworthy case in the above mentioned report Terrorism Financing Indicators for Financial Institutions in the United States involved two small businesses  a deli and an ice cream shop. The case highlighted 12 feeder accounts held at multiple U.S. banks. Money was deposited into the feeder accounts by various means, including check deposits, cash deposits, and wire transfers. Bank records for the 12 feeder accounts revealed 3,252 cash deposits. The deposits were structured to avoid reporting requirements. Only one of them was a cash deposit for more than $10,000 triggering a reporting requirement. However, on each of several hundred days, an aggregate of more than $10,000 was deposited into the feeder accounts. The ice cream shop also operated as an unlicensed and unregistered money transmitter and over an eight year period, $22.1 million was deposited into the feeder accounts even though the small shop only had annual revenue of about $185,000. The funds were subsequently consolidated into a central account in the U.S. using checks and wire transfers from the 12 accounts; and $21.9 million was wired from the central account on behalf of customers in the U.S. to accounts in 25 countries, ultimately making its way back to Yemen. The recipient operators who controlled the accounts in those countries exchanged the funds into local currency and distributed payments to the intended beneficiaries. Evidence showed that the money transfers were tied to funding for al-Qaeda and Hamas. This case clearly illustrates that terrorist financers often uses classic money laundering typologies regardless of whether they are trying to launder the proceeds of crime. The study concluded that by using standard anti-money laundering typologies financial institutions should have been able to identify fourteen instances of terrorism financing as being suspicious, even though the FI might not see on the face of it that the suspicious activity was in fact linked to terrorism financing.

Other terrorist financing cases have involved bank fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, identity fraud and a host of criminal activities which we typically consider much less grave than the funding of terrorism. The FBI has indicated that numerous terrorist investigations have resulted from financial information provided by the financial sector and that is has assisted with connecting the dots.

Terrorism Financing Version 2.0  Counter-terrorism Experts Highlight A Dangerous Union: The Intersection of Terrorism and Organized Crime

A distinguished panel of witnesses all emphasized one dominant trend at last weeks congressional hearing before the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist Financing  terrorists increasingly are turning to crime and criminal networks for funding. Chairman Mike Fitzpatrick commented in his opening remarks that Terrorist groups have become entwined with trans-national criminal syndicates  or in some cases evolving into the role themselves  engaging in criminal activities which yield greater profits than simply relying on state sponsorship or big pocket donors. Expert after expert witness confirmed that shared view. The words in their testimonies were different but their message was the same. As terrorist groups have become larger and more organized and have sought to raise more money, they have been forced into closer cooperation with organized criminals and have copied some of their methods. Although terrorists continue to raise money through legal means such as collecting funds from witting or unwitting donors through established charities or by direct donation, David Asher, Board of Advisors Member for The Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance referred to the emergence of a trend which he termed Terrorism Financing Version 2.0. Mr. Asher elaborated that Version 2.0 represents a vast evolution above and beyond the traditional religious charities, mosques, and jihadi financiers and involves a substantial embrace of transnational organized crime. As illicit finance expert Douglas Farah succinctly summarized  The TOC [Transnational Organized Crime] / terrorism divide is increasingly disappearing.

In some cases, terrorist groups primarily pursue criminal activities for fundraising purposes. According to the DEA, 22 of 59 Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2014 were linked to drug trafficking. The DEA, the FBI, and the intelligence community have focused more and more attention on the nexus between drugs and terror and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has merged its international drug and foreign terrorism sections because of the intimate link between the two. Juan Zarate who testified before the Task Force last month, stated that Americas enemies  drug trafficking cartels, organized crime groups, militant groups, and terrorists  are finding each other, as a matter of convenience and opportunity. Mr. Zarate emphasized that the overlaps between the criminal underworld, illicit financial activity, and terrorist operations and funding will continue to evolve as marriages of convenience emerge in common areas of operation.

382,"Fraud detection with machine learning requires large datasets to train a model, weighted variables, and human review only as a last defense.

With advances in computer technology and ecommerce also comes increased vulnerability to fraud. Hackers are continuously finding new ways to target undeserving victims, from stolen credit card details to false accounts. Any business or individual who uses online payment sources is open to fraud.

In 2015, financial fraud  including payment cards, remote banking and cheques  rose a staggering 26 percent from the previous year, totaling a cost of £755 million. It was the fourth consecutive year that has seen an increase in this area. It is the most common crime in the UK, with 2.47 million offenses reported in 2015-2016 alone. The multi-million pound cost of fraud is proving detrimental to online businesses who foot a high proportion of the bill in chargebacks.

In 2015 all fraud types had risen with much owed to the growth of impersonation and deception scams, as well as sophisticated online attacks such as malware and data breaches.

Why transaction rules arent enough

The traditional approach to tackling this problem is to use rules or logic statements to query transactions and to direct suspicious transactions through to human review. While there is some variation, it is notable that over 90 percent of online fraud detection platforms still use this method, including platforms used by banks and payment gateways. While this is effective to some degree, in cases where there is a sufficient gap between an order being received and goods being shipped, it is also incredibly costly and far slower than alternatives.

The rules in these platform use a combination of data, horizon-scanning and gut-feel. The system is backed with manual reviews to confirm experts decisions. If we take the recent reports of an abundance of Turkish credit cards available on the darknet due to the publicized data breach in Turkey: businesses recognize the increased risk of Turkish cards as fraudulent and can simply add a rule to review any transactions from Turkish credit cards

Following this, every attempted purchase made by such a card raises an alert and is declined or reviewed. However, this raises two significant issues. The first is that such a generalized rule may turn away millions of legitimate customers, ultimately losing the business money and jeopardizing customer relations. Secondly, while this can deter future threats after such fraud has been found, it fails to identify or predict potential threats that businesses are not aware of.

These rules tend to produce binary results, deeming transactions as either good or bad and failing to consider anything in between. And until the rules are manually reviewed, the system will continue to prevent such transactions as those from Turkish credit cards, even if the risk or threat is no longer prominent.

When human review fails

Criminal gangs also use malware and phishing emails as a means to compromise customers security and personal details. Once obtained, fraudsters will use these details to access customer accounts or to commit fraud. These methods all aim to compromise customers personal and financial details, including card data, in order to enable the criminals to commit fraud. Here, the card data used is legitimate but is not being used under the consent of the owner. In these cases, such rules would fail to block transactions.

According to the 2015 Merchant Risk Council (MRC) Global Fraud Survey, merchants typically manually review 10-15 percent of online orders. Other reports suggest that as many as 26 percent of ecommerce orders are manually reviewed. This is prime example of how human endeavor is failing to use and enhance computing efficiency.

Machine learning for fraud detection

Machine learning has been recognized as a successful measure for fraud detection. A great deal of data is transferred during online transaction processes, resulting in a binary result: genuine or fraudulent. Online businesses are able to identify fraudulent transactions accurately because they receive chargebacks on them. However, this happens after the transaction has been processed and therefore is reactive, not proactive.

Machine learning works on the basis of large, historical datasets that have been created using a collection of data across many clients and industries. Even companies that only process a relatively small number of transactions are able to take full advantage of the data sets for their vertical, allowing them to get accurate decisions on each transaction. This aggregation of data provides a highly accurate set of training data, and the access to this information allows businesses to choose the right model to optimize the levels of recall and precision that they provide: out of all the transactions the model predicts to be fraudulent (recall), what proportion of these actually are (precision)?

Once the accuracy of the models is deemed acceptable it is time to start predicting, but where do such predictions come from?

Within the datasets, features are constructed. These are data points such as the age and value of the customer account, as well as the origin of the credit card. There can be hundreds of features and each contributes, to varying extents, towards the fraud probability. Note, the degree in which each feature contributes to the fraud score is not determined by a fraud analyst, but is generated by the artificial intelligence of the machine which is driven by the training set. So, in regards to the Turkish card fraud, if the use of Turkish cards to commit fraud is proven to be high, the fraud weighting of a transaction that uses a Turkish credit card will be equally so. However, if this were to diminish, the contribution level would parallel. Simply put, these models self-learn without explicit programming such as with manual review.

Such features in machine learning-based systems make it possible for fraud analysts to identify the most significant contributors. Feedback from users to confirm the systems decisions by marking customers as genuine or fraudster improves the machines learning ability, adding to accuracy.

Three steps to predict fraud using machine learning

Extract features from a dataset.
Provide training set.
Build models.

In questioning the practicality of building the models, note that models can be reused from similar data. Example: A model used for one retail ecommerce site will also work for another, albeit with minor adjustments of features, thus meaning the implementation of such a model is relatively quick.

Merchants who use such systems are continuously assessing customers for fraud, recalculating a score with every action that occurs on their website or app. If an action is deemed to breach the fraud probability threshold, the transaction will be blocked.

In order to lessen, and hopefully defeat, the onslaught of fraud, businesses must improve the accuracy and speed of their decisions on fraudulent threats. The only mature technology available to achieve this is machine learning. Manual review is most effective as the last defense against fraud: While it can be invaluable, particularly in cases where there is no substitute for human insight, manual review works best to help fine-tune machine learning models decisions and aid their detection of changing patterns of fraud, rather than being the sole fraud detection process. Information from detected fraud threats needs to be used to enhance the next generation of automated fraud prevention, rather than replace it.",nam
383,"Jim Lee, a pollster with Susquehanna Polling and Research, told the WFMZ ""Business Matters"" panel last week why he believes there is a ""submerged"" Trump vote that polls are not registering.

LANNELLI: Good evening, we are talking election 2020, it is a crazy year across the board. Jim Lee, polling right now, I don't want to say all over the place, but first and foremost, many people want to say it's not legitimate. It doesn't work, particularly on the trump side, six or seven points hidden numbers. Your thoughts on where we are in the polling?
LEE: There is definitely a submerged Trump vote. Polling can be an art, it can be a science. When pollsters get the results back and they look suspicious because one candidate has a double digit lead carried by one candidate by a point or two, they should realize something is not right and that is where the art of the polling comes in. I would like to talk about the disparities, 2016 and where we are today.
LANNELLI: Chris, you are everywhere, you are on my show. That's how far you have come.
BORICK: I've made it, Tony.
LANNELLI: Do you get the suspicion, he's a Biden guy or a Trump guy?
BORICK: From both sides, if people don't like where their results are, they are going to complain. A lot of it is motivated reason, if you wanted to see a number that you hope for and its not there you are going to complain. That's why we are an evidence-based thing. Look at the final results, you can see the records of pollsters.
LANNELLI: It is legitimate for those that say 10 or 11 points 2016, explain that, I guess.
BORICK: Look at the final, the aggregate results 2016. Pennsylvania, the average before the election was two points in favor of Hillary Clinton, president won by less than one point. A little bit off. Those polls were closing. You saw the national polls. Here's the story that people don't look at, national polls average two points -- three points for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She won the popular vote by two points, they were closer than they were in 2012.
LANNELLI: You think the double digits trump is behind are legitimate?
BORICK: I don't know if it's ten, but it is significant.
LANNELLI: Do you agree?
LEE: Absolutely not. Trump has a dead heat in Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina released today, statistical dead heat. Speaking of polling in 2016, Im embarrassed by some of the firms releasing polling three days before the 2016 election. Our friends in Lancaster showing Clinton with an 11-point lead. Talk about voter suppression, you talk about the average lead. Heres the numbers in 2016, on October 10, 2016, the average RealClearPolitics lead, Wisconsin- Clinton, 6.8%. Actual, Trump by a point. average lead for Clinton 8.6%. Garbage polling. Im telling you there is a standard for polling has become lax. I was one of the few polling firms take on the Patriot news in Harrisburg and call out egregious polling by academic liberal institutions missing the mark with polling and in fact, the RealClear average today is seven points for Biden and the race is a statistical tie according to our polls. I think they owe the state of Pennsylvania an apology.
LANNELLI: are you entertained by that?
BORICK: Jim's twisting it. the Franklin and Marshal poll was off that year. I would look over the history of the polls, including your polls. we have been off on elections. We are transparent as can be, part of polling is taking a small sample and making inference about big samples. You statistically sometimes miss. There are method logical reasons for it. Look at how they perform look at them at all there races.

384,"One of the most significant, but least covered, parts of the war on terror has been the Treasury Department's effort to shut down al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups' access to financial institutions. It's an attractive way of tackling the problem: Freezing accounts here isn't as expensive as sending in troops or airstrikes, and no civilians get hurt.

Except the second part might not be true. A report released last week by the Center for Global Development, authored by a working group chaired by visiting fellow Clay Lowery and senior fellow Vijaya Ramachandran, argues that laws meant to counteract money laundering and terrorism financing are encouraging broader ""derisking,"" in which Western banks cut off ties with financial institutions in the developing world so as to reduce the odds that they'll run afoul of regulations. The result is that developing-world banks, money transfer organizations (which handle remittances), and nonprofit organizations are losing access to the financial system as a whole.

That can have real human consequences. People in countries like Somalia or Nigeria who rely on remittances from relatives in rich countries like the US could see fewer transfers or higher fees. NGOs doing health programs or cash transfers could see programs scaled back due to lack of banking. Foreign investment in developing countries could decrease due to fewer big international banks dealing in those countries.

These concerns aren't just hypothetical. A 2013 survey by CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) found that 70 percent of remittance-handling companies in Australia either had accounts closed or had been threatened with closure. Barclay's is estimated to have closed accounts for more than 140 British remittance companies. Remittances alone totaled nearly $600 billion last year, more than double all official foreign aid, and bank moves like these seriously jeopardize those flows. And that's not even considering the effects on developing country banks and NGOs. ""Even the large NGOs trying to do cash programs are having trouble getting a bank account,"" Ramachandran told me.

The rules are longstanding. But the enforcement has ramped up.

The US federal government has been fighting money laundering for decades, dating back at least to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. And since 1990, rich nations have coordinated their policy response to the problem through a group called the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). FATF has generally advocated a ""risk-based approach"" to money laundering enforcement. With customers and activities unlikely to be engaged in laundering, authorities can use less invasive, simpler enforcement methods. But for customers and activities judged at high risk, enforcement gets more resource-intensive and intricate.

This works pretty well for ordinary money laundering, since you can identify low-risk customers just by seeing who doesn't have very much money in the bank. A checking account with $17 in it doesn't really need to be closely analyzed for laundering behavior. But it's much trickier when you're trying to combat terrorism financing. Even though some suspected terrorism financiers will be on sanctions lists, there's doubtless some financing happening through individuals and organizations that aren't on law enforcement or intelligence agencies' radars. That means financial regulators have to look at the whole pool. And they can't necessarily rule out accounts or transactions involving small amounts: As the CGD report quotes FATF advising, ""Transactions associated with the financing of terrorists may be conducted in very small amounts, which in applying a risk-based approach could be the very transactions that are frequently considered to be of minimal risk with regard to money laundering.""

What's more, after 9/11, enforcement by US authorities ramped up, with the total number of fines issued spiking:

(CGD)

And the total value of fines has grown in recent years from trivial levels into the billions:

(CGD)

The financial sector responded to this uptick in enforcement by ""withdrawing wholesale from types of activities or business sectors that are seen to be riskier,"" Lowery and Ramachandran write.

This process is known as ""derisking,"" and it's had a serious impact on the developing world, especially in countries judged to be high risk for terrorism financing. Numerous companies are pulling out of the remittance business, which puts people receiving remittances in poor countries at risk of serious financial hardship. International banks are showing wariness of dealing with banks in ""high-risk countries,"" which could hurt investment and endanger the livelihoods of people there. And, perhaps predictably, nonprofits judged to be overly ""Islamic"" are getting targeted, regardless of the humanitarian work they do.

Here are just a few of the indicators Lowery and Ramachandran compiled showing developed country banks curbing their relationships with remittance companies, developing country banks, and NGOs working in the developing world:

In the US, Sunrise Community Bank and Merchants Bank of California closed all Somali remittance accounts. Merchants had been responsible for 80 percent of remittances to Somalia.
In the UK, HSBC pulled out of the remittance sector entirely.
A report from the British Bankers association found that counter-party relationships between ""high-risk"" countries and international clearinghouses fell by 6 percent from 2012 to 2014.
A 2014 poll of banks found that more than 40 percent of respondents cited money laundering regulations as a ""very significant"" impediment to trade in Africa.
Reports from both the World Bank and the Norwegian Refugee Council documented banks admitting in correspondence that they will not transfer funds to nonprofits they perceive to be ""Islamic.""

And following the CGD report, the undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, reported results from a World Bank survey of financial institutions suggesting that this derisking process was making it meaningfully more expensive to do business in the developing world. ""Three-quarters of the large banks indicated that they had reduced the number of their correspondent accounts in recent years,"" Sheets said in a speech at CGD. ""On the respondent side, a majority of local and regional banks reported a decline in the number of their correspondent accounts, with [remittance businesses] and small clients particularly affected. The vast majority of affected banks reported that they were able to find replacements, though often at a higher cost.""

The good news: People in power are aware of the problem

The solution here, Ramachandran told me, will likely take the form of better, subtler enforcement rather than huge changes in the legal framework. ""The big picture is that these rules have to be implemented better, in a smarter way than what's happening now,"" she says. ""What we're arguing is that we need better implementation of the risk-based approach. They should be able to address risk on a case-by-case basis rather labeling entire entities as high risk.""

Case-by-case enforcement means that innocent people in ""high-risk"" countries like Somalia will take less of a hit, but it could also mean that the counterterrorism goals of the enforcement regime are easier to meet. The fewer transparent mechanisms for transferring money to poor countries, like remittance services, there are, the more people start to turn to less traceable methods, like just transferring cash in suitcases (as reportedly has been happening in Somalia). ""What we're seeing is that money is beginning to flow through less transparent mechanisms,"" Ramachandran says. ""This is not what we want, from either a development perspective or a security perspective.""

Luckily, key stakeholders are recognizing that this is a concern. The fact that a senior Treasury official like Sheets appeared at the CGD event unveiling the new report, and provided data confirming the scale of the problem, was itself a significant good omen. FATF, the international antimoney laundering coordinating body, has warned financial institutions against wholesale derisking. ""The FATF Recommendations only require financial institutions to terminate customer relationships, on a case-by-case basis, where the money laundering and terrorist financing risks cannot be mitigated,"" the group said in a statement. ""What is not in line with the FATF standards is the wholesale cutting loose of entire classes of customer.""

A significant faction in Congress has also begun to champion the issue and pressure US authorities for better enforcement. In February, three senators and nine members of the House wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and other major executive branch policymakers warning of decreasing remittance options for Somali Americans, saying a solution is required to ""protect our national security and avoid exacerbating a humanitarian crisis."" Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN)  whose state has a significant Somali refugee population  brought up the issue during Yellen's February testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, and Yellen conceded derisking was ""causing a great deal of hardship.""

The problem is hardly solved  but unlike plenty of other policy areas, there at least seems to be some interest in Washington in addressing it.

386,"DC's 5G initiative has been shrouded in mystery, and at this point we'll probably never truly know what the publisher was planning with this ambitious project. DC's Publisher/Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee confirmed the long-rumored reboot of DC's comic book line is no more.As Newsarama reports, Lee revealed the news during prerecorded Q&A segment at DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse. Lee confirmed DC won't be publishing a comic or event called 5G, nor are there plans to perform a sweeping overhaul of DC's continuity a la 2011's New 52 relaunch. Instead, DC will take a character-driven approach to its comic book lineup, as the company shifts focus in the wake of major layoffs and editorial restructuring.""There won't be a project called '5G', or a big reboot, or whatever,"" Lee said. ""We really want to focus on individual titles, and organically build up individual characters over the course of the next year.""""We had a lot of great ideas that we were floating around,"" Lee continued. ""And rather than dumping it all in one month and renumbering the line and going for that really short-term spike in sales, we just naturally gravitated to the story ideas and concepts we love and building them into the mythology - the ongoing mythology - in a very organic way.""

While DC has never been clear on what exactly 5G was, it was rumored to be an ambitious reboot built around the fallout of Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock and the creation of a new, unified DC Universe timeline. Former Co-Publisher Dan DiDio had revealed glimpses of that detailed timeline in 2019, which organized DC's entire, 80-year publishing history into four distinct generations, beginning with Wonder Woman's public debut (Generation 1) and spanning until the present (Generation 4). 5G was reportedly the start of Generation 5, with traditional heroes like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne aging out of their roles and a younger generation of heroes rising up to take their place.

However, between DiDio's surprise departure from DC and the quiet cancellation of DC's Free Comic Book Day 2020 release, Generation Zero, all signs have pointed to DC pivoting away from its 5G plans in 2020. Lee's confirmation is merely the official death knell for 5G. As Lee makes clear, not all the stories originally planned for 5G are being abandoned, but DC is no longer setting up a widespread reboot of its comic book line. Nor does it sound like Batman and Superman will get to enjoy retirement anytime soon.A History of DC's Crisis Comics

That's not to say we won't see some sort of new reader-friendly DC relaunch in the near future. As we've explored before, a number of perennial DC books are ending in the next several months (Teen Titans, Suicide Squad, Batgirl) while Brian Michael Bendis is ending his runs on Superman and Action Comics and Joshua Williamson is wrapping up his nearly five-year stint on The Flash. At the very least, we're expecting to see a widespread reshuffling of creative talent in early 2021 and a number of new series announced, even if Lee has previously indicated DC won't publish quite as many monthly comics as it has in recent years.

387,"Ed. note: Welcome to the second installment of Better Know A Practice Area, a new series introducing readers to different practice areas. Each post is written by an editor at Practical Law who previously practiced in that area and currently writes about it. In case you missed it, you can read the first installment here (discussing capital markets and corporate governance practice).

Todays topic: securities litigation and enforcement.

What do you do in a typical day?

A typical day of a securities litigation and enforcement associate might involve:

Interviewing custodians of documents potentially responsive to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) request for information.
Meeting with a client to prepare her for upcoming testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Department of Justice.
Conducting review of a clients potentially privileged documents, preparing a privilege log, and coordinating production to the SEC.
Drafting a portion of the brief in support of a motion dismissing a securities fraud complaint against a client.
Strategizing with a joint defense group on coordinated discovery and oral argument on a motion in a case asserting claims under the federal securities laws.
Preparing a deposition outline for a witness in a securities fraud case.

Who do you work with?

Junior associates mostly work with senior associates and sometimes partners. As associates grow more senior, responsibilities increase and associates have more direct contact with clients and the opposite side. In the securities litigation and enforcement practice, the opponents include plaintiffs lawyers, enforcement counsel of securities regulators, such as the SEC and FINRA, and often prosecutors from the U.S. Attorneys Office or the DOJ.

Associates in this area are often tasked with coordinating collection, review, and production of documents, which usually requires collaborating with e-discovery vendors and the clients IT and legal departments and working with the opposite side. Associates may also be tasked with preparing witnesses for depositions or meetings with regulators, which usually requires multiple meetings or teleconferences with client representatives.

What does a common career path look like?

Its common knowledge that there is a revolving door between the government and private practice for securities litigation and enforcement lawyers. With increased regulatory oversight in recent years, this is now as true as ever. Lawyers practicing in this area often move to the government after a few years in private practice. The most common government positions are state and federal prosecutors or enforcement counsel at the SEC, CFTC, or FINRA (a non-governmental securities industry regulator). Some lawyers make a career in the government, and others return to private practice as counsel or partner.

Besides government, lawyers in this practice often move to the financial institutions in-house litigation teams or compliance departments, or pursue judicial clerkships. Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers are mostly based in major financial centers, such as New York, Chicago or San Francisco.

If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

This practice area offers a good degree of variety. Regulatory matters can concern different subject matters, from compliance with securities laws technical requirements, such as retention of electronic communications, to propriety of corporate disclosures, to allegations of securities fraud. Lawyers involved in these matters often conduct investigations of alleged misconduct, which is perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the practice. Investigations include review of electronic communication, witness interviews, communication with the government, and presentation of findings to the board of directors.

Handling private securities lawsuits most often involves motion practice and voluminous document discovery and depositions. Motions frequently filed in these cases include motion to dismiss, motion to decertify class, and motion for summary judgment.

How much wear and tear?

The work is fast-paced and demanding because the stakes can be high, involving large fines or settlements, industry suspensions and bars, and possibly criminal convictions. Associates are expected to be able to master large amounts of facts quickly and think strategically. Partners are not always able to commit enough time to learning all the facts and regularly rely on associates to supply details and recommendations, especially in large and complex matters.

Associates also invariably review very large amounts of documents and are expected to do so thoroughly and accurately because mistakes can be costly. For instance, making an incorrect privilege call and including a privileged document in the production can result in the assertion of a privilege waiver and have a dramatically negative effect on the case.

Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?

Lawyers practicing securities litigation and enforcement tend to like the practice. That said, handling matters involving some of the securities laws more technical aspects may be a less than exciting experience. As for most litigators, coordinating and conducting the review and production of large amounts of documents is probably the most tedious part of the job. Most securities litigators also dont enjoy having to become familiar with the fine print in the documentation supporting fraud claims, such as the often massive offering documentation for a security or a companys annual filings.

Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?

Most lawyers practicing in this area enjoy being involved in cases with high stakes, often accompanied by media coverage and publicity. Some of the most exciting parts of the practice are conducting internal investigations to uncover potential wrongdoing and battling prosecutors on the admissibility of wiretap evidence, propriety of search warrants and other devices available to the government.

Lawyers in this area also tend to be smart and competent. So, whether an attorney is on a joint defense team or across the table from them, working with good lawyers is a privilege. In addition, the world of securities litigation and enforcement lawyers is relatively small, so people are mostly courteous and professional because they know that they will likely meet again.

Are there common avenues out of this practice area?

Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers who dont want to continue practicing in this area often make a move to securities regulatory agencies, or become federal or state prosecutors or in-house compliance officers.

What are some market trends that impact this practice area?

Volatility of financial markets has a great impact on securities regulation and litigation. On the one hand, financial crises bring about litigation and increased regulatory oversight. On the other, bull markets result in increased transactional activity (mergers, IPOs, etc.), which give rise to litigation and changes in regulatory landscape. In general, the more market activity, the more work for securities litigators and enforcement lawyers.

Currently, the legal matters concerning the 2008 mortgage crisis are winding down and markets have largely recovered. Many practitioners think that the next wave of work in the securities litigation and enforcement area will be in lawsuits concerning a large number of IPOs that took place during the last several years. In addition, the securities regulators and the DOJ appear increasingly focused on enforcing compliance with securities laws and holding individuals responsible for misconduct, which will likely result in an uptick in the enforcement matters.

If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?

Beside genuine, demonstrated interest in financial markets, a good candidate would have all the usual qualities of a good litigator: thoroughness, attention to detail, good judgment, and ability to express herself clearly both orally and in writing.

Also, handling a large regulatory matter or representing a defendant in a securities class action can be a protracted and often frustrating experience. So, patience and an even-keeled demeanor will also be helpful to attorneys practicing in this area.",nam
388,"As part of its fight against money laundering and financing terrorist acts and organizations, the Ministry of Finance (the  Ministry ) issued the Regulation on Suspension of Suspicious Transactions (the  Regulation ) on July 29, 2016. The Regulation focuses on suspending suspicious fund transfers.

Who are the responsible parties?

The parties that are responsible for implementing the Regulation are legal entities and real persons as stated under Article 4 of the Regulation on Measures Regarding Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, published in the Official Gazette No. 26751 dated January 9, 2008. These responsible parties include mainly banks and other financial institutions.

What the regulation says

According to the Regulation, fund transfers will be suspended in the following events:

Suspicious transaction report

If there is a document or serious indication supporting the suspicion that the asset subject to the attempted transaction is related to money laundering or financing of terrorism, the responsible party must send a suspicious transaction report to the Financial Crimes Investigation Board ( MASAK ) with the request for suspension of the transaction.
To suspend a transaction, there must be a serious suspicion such as:

the transaction has an extraordinary nature;
the person(s) carrying out the transaction have been identified to be related to the crime as a result of research through several databases or other sources; or
there is a probability that the completion of the transaction will inhibit or aggravate confiscation of the funds which may be related to financing of terrorism or crime proceeds.

Related parties shall abstain from carrying out the transactions included in a suspicious transaction report until MASAK serves the Ministry of Finances decision to them.
The suspension may last for up to seven business days.

Assets identified by MASAK

If there are documents or serious indications supporting that the concerned assets are related to money laundering and/or financing of terrorism, the Minister of Finance will decide on the suspension of the transactions and the decision will be served to the relevant responsible party by MASAK.
The responsible party will not be able to carry out the transactions specified in the Minister of Finances decision for seven business days.

Requests of AML institutions

If there are documents or serious indications supporting that transactions reported by foreign AML institutions are related to money laundering and/or financing of terrorism, MASAK will evaluate the request and the Minister of Finance will decide thereon.
The Minister of Finance will render its decision based on the reciprocity principle.
MASAK will serve the Minister of Finances decision on suspension of the transactions and the responsible party will not be able carry out the concerned transactions for seven business days.

Conclusion

As part of the fight against the terrorist organization that orchestrated the attempted coup, the Turkish Government, under the constitutionally granted authority, has been expected to issue expedient and effective legislation for expeditious elimination of terrorist threats. The Regulation is among the precautions taken in the last two weeks to provide for a legal infrastructure which will enable Government officials to respond strongly to those who have been involved in the coup attempt by making it possible to block suspicious fund transfers.",nam
389,"Remember the TV show Full House? Perhaps you, like many of the shows fans, had a big-time crush on actress Lori Loughlin, who played Rebecca. These days, you can find Lori Loughlin starring in the Hallmark Channels popular series When Calls the Heart. Recently, the actress talked to Your Teen about raising teenagers in her own full house.

Interview with Actress Lori Loughlin

Q: How many children do you have?

Loughlin: I have two daughters  14 and 15  and a 22-year-old stepson.

Q: How would you describe yourself as a parent of teenagers?

Loughlin: I try to be open-minded and patient. Its trickier now that the girls are teenagers because they look at me like Im not hip or cool  like I dont really know whats going on. I try to parent so that they dont really realize theyre being parented and approach them in a way thats not too aggressive or stern. For the most part, Im there in it, with the everyday ebb and flow of their moods. And yes, it can be challenging.

Q: Do your daughters want to act?

Loughlin: When they were younger, they would say that they wanted to act, but I dont hear about it anymore. I think my older one would like to work in fashion, in some capacity, and my younger one loves makeup. I would not be surprised if she became a makeup artist. Shes 14 and shows a lot of talent for it. They both could end up doing something behind the camera.

Q: Neither one has done theater in high school?

Loughlin: They go to a wonderful school with a great theater program, but they have not auditioned for anything. Youre either passionate about theater (you want to get on that stage) or you arent. Since theyve never auditioned, I know that theyre not that interested.

Q: And when did you know that you wanted to act?

Loughlin: I knew when I was five years old. I grew up in New York and was exposed to Broadway shows from a young age. I loved movies as a child and that was always my fantasy and the vision.

Q: Was it hard getting into the industry?

Loughlin: Not really. When I was about 12 years old, my mothers friend invited me to go with her daughters to a modeling agency. My mom agreed, probably thinking that nothing would come of it. But, they hired me for some print work and modeling. I started out modeling and then doing commercials. When I was a teenager, I got a role on a daytime soap opera. But, we went into this completely blind, figuring it out as we went along.

Q: And how did you, at that young age, keep your head on your shoulders?

Loughlin: My father said to me, Listen, we will support you, and we will help you, but if I see any change in your attitude, youre done. Youre out. Also, I have a nice, down-to-earth family with no sense of entitlement. I was raised to be a grateful and courteous human being.

Q: I love that you said, grateful and courteous. How do you instill that in your teenagers?

Loughlin: I certainly try. My girls have rules to follow. My husband and I teach them good manners and gratitude. And, its funny  when we are out with kids who are, in their opinion, somewhat spoiled or impolite, my girls really notice and comment. And, I always say to them, Let that be a lesson to you. People notice if you have manners, if youre courteous and if youre kind. People pay attention to that stuff. And, its important just to be a good human being and put your best foot forward because certainly, like my grandmother used to say, We all came into the world the same way, and we will all leave in the same way, and no one is more special or better than the next guy. Thats what I try to instill in my kids.

Q: Are your kids growing up differently than you did?

Loughlin: In some ways. They have access in a different way than I did. I watched Scott Baio on TV, dreaming one day about meeting him. My girls have big crushes on Justin Bieber, and they were able to meet him. But, I try to keep that at a minimum. I dont let them go to a party or a premiere on a school night. We just try to keep it as normal as possible.

Q: Wow, invited to a premiere, and they get told No. Thats something I dont have to deal with.

Loughlin: Because of what I do, they have access in a different way. But, I always tell my girls that being famous isnt all its cracked up to be. You know, being a good person, working hard, achieving goals  thats what its all about. Fame doesnt mean very much.

Q: Are you relieved that your girls didnt go down that path at a young age?

Loughlin: I never gave them that opportunity. I told them to get an education and then explore acting. I didnt go to college because I was busy working. And I always had this sink or swim feeling in my life. I want my girls to have something more substantial to fall back on if it doesnt work out because it can be a hard business. But, like I said, they have not shown any interest in being in front of the camera.

Q: Can you share a best and worst parenting moment?

Loughlin: Oh my goodness, I am sure I have many of both. I have definitely lost my temper and reacted too quickly. The girls can catch me at a moment after they have been at me all day, and I just snap. I am not proud of those moments, but I know they probably happen to all of us. And, my best parenting moment is when I take a step back and dont respond immediately, when I take a deep breath and collect myself. If something comes up in the morning and instead of reacting to it, I revisit it later in the day after I have collected my thoughts and can talk about it calmly.

Q: So you could write the parenting book.

Loughlin: I couldnt write any parenting book. Boy oh boy. I am just out there every day, swinging at it and doing the best I can. Some days are more successful than others, but I certainly dont ever pretend to have any of the answers. I just dont.

Q: Well nobody does, but you sound like you have some thoughtful approaches, which is good.

Loughlin: I try. In my work, in my marriage, in my parenting, I try. I set that goal for myself every day. Whether I achieve it or not, I dont know. Some days are better than others, like I said.

Q: Shifting from parenting, do you have a favorite role?

Loughlin: I did a TV movie many years ago for FOX called, Doing Time on Maple Drive, with Ken Olin and a great cast. I really loved my character in that piece. I just loved the whole message of that movie.

Loughlin: Yes, we are in fact. We are absolutely still in touch. And, I am always talking to John Stamos and Candace Cameron.",nam

Counterterrorism finance efforts should shift away from our current compliance-based structure toward one that rewards ingenuity and activism among banks.

What Terrorism Risk Insurance Means for Banks
Banks have stepped up efforts to extend the government's terrorism risk insurance program, fearing that Congress may fail to act before it is scheduled to expire at yearend.
By Victoria Finkle
March 6

The fight against terrorist financing took a fascinating turn last week as several international hacking groups announced plans to target banks, countries and individuals who had helped to finance the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and other terrorist organizations.

The plan, dubbed #OpCharlieHebdo, was formed by groups including Anonymous and Ghost Security in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. It is intriguing and somewhat unsettling that hackers would make decisions about financial institutions' compliance with counter-terrorism measures. But their efforts underscore the need for governments, banks and regulators to work harder at rooting out the sources of ISIS's funding.

Experts agree that ISIS is funded primarily by external transactions such as black market oil sales and ransom payments, as well as internal transactions such as tax collection, human trafficking and bank takeovers. When external transactions are completed in cash, they have ties to the formal banking system. For example, ransom payments originate from bank accounts of insurance companies and government agencies in the European Union, which use brokers to make cash payments to terrorists. And, as Notre Dame law professor and former Treasury under secretary for enforcement Jimmy Gurulé testified before the House Committee on Financial Services in November, ""If ISIS is generating $1 to $2 million dollars a day from the illicit sale of oil, it is difficult to imagine that banks are not being used to transfer such large sums of money to entities controlled by ISIS.""

This concern was echoed by David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in an October speech. He said:

ISIL's ability to make the most effective use of money that it raises depends on its access to the banking system in Syria, Iraq, and internationally. Operating entirely in cash is both cumbersome and risky  cash is bulky, vulnerable to theft, and requires complicated logistics to transport. Moreover, ISIL will have a hard time funding external operations, including facilitating the movement of foreign fighters, without access to the international financial system.

""Scores of bank branches are located in territories where ISIL operates,"" Cohen continued, vowing to prevent the terrorist group from using those branches. ""The private sector is playing a key role in provid[ing] valuable insight into financial activity in areas where ISIL operates.""

It's clear that counter-terrorist financing measures are necessary to defeat ISIS. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that the measures implemented thus far have left much to be desired.

For one thing, the Financial Action Task Force's evaluations of different countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards often miss the mark. Macau is a case in point: the money laundering capital of Asia received a glowing evaluation.

Many financial institutions also tend to pay negligible attention to counter-terrorist financing law. Thousands of compliance officers are experts in complying with the law rather than interpreting it. This is not necessarily their fault: we should not be tasking compliance officers with interpreting the law if they are not lawyers.

Moreover, the U.S. devotes enormous resources to enforcing AML compliance but fails to take the same measures in the higher-risk area of counter-terrorist financing compliance. As Gurulé noted in his testimony, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has brought only two major cases against banks charged with violating the anti-terrorist financing provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act in the last decade. Our priorities ought to be the reverse. Terrorist financing kills people and directly threatens democracy. Money laundering does not.

If counter-terrorist financing laws had been effectively enforced, ISIS would never have risen to power, occupying an area the size of the United Kingdom. Nor would it have had the financial capacity to start and continue its horrific reign of terror.

These failures have not been lost on Anonymous and their colleagues. They are fighting ISIS in the digital shadows precisely because we have not been able to prevent ISIS from thriving financially.

If you are a director or officer of a global financial institution, fund, online payment processor or money services business, the idea that hackers are engaged in counter-terrorist financing efforts should be frightening. Banks are now answerable to people who are not only anonymous, but who can  with a few clicks  take the bank offline and download data on any client, transaction, or executive. Moreover, they aim to make banks answerable in the court of public opinion for unwittingly funding terrorism.

So far, #OpCharlieHebdo has taken down the websites of government agencies in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey as well as about 80 websites believed to be controlled by ISIS that publish terrorist propaganda. And while the hacking groups haven't taken down any banks yet, they have given notice to banks in Saudi Arabia that they will be targeted. That could well apply to Western banks in Saudi Arabia, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.

Some people reading this likely applaud hackers' efforts to shut down ISIS websites and debilitate them. Everyone, including Wall Street bankers, can love an anti-hero.

But vigilante justice will lose its allure if hackers infiltrate our financial institutions and  without the benefit of experience in counter-terrorism law  make judgment calls about the culpability of banks and their executives. Such judgments cannot be fairly made in the absence of the rule of law.

In order for democracy to work, we must all subscribe to its ideals. Hackers must play by the rules. And banks and regulators must crack down on compliance in order to mitigate terrorist financing.

Clearly, we are at a point in history where banks must be exceedingly vigilant. Anonymous is indeed watching.",nam
391,"Growing worries about the use of the U.S. financial system to launder funds for terrorists has spurred proposals for new state and federal regulations aimed at tightening money-laundering controls.

""If you look at what's been happening in terrorism around the world, ISIS is an example of a terrorist organization that is now becoming sufficiently institutionalized in terms of its access to natural resources and substantial amounts of money,"" says cybercrime attorney Lauren Resnick, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where she led the computer crimes and intellectual property section. She now works at the law firm BakerHostetler.

""So, the view is that terrorist financing is hitting a new stage. And while individual acts of terrorism are not necessarily costly, we have major organizations around the world that may want to access the U.S. financial system because they have significant amounts of capital to invest. That is a big concern among the players in the financial industry, as well as the regulators.""

State and Federal Regulatory Changes

In an exclusive interview with Information Security Media Group, Resnick explains how proposed state and federal regulatory changes for Bank Secrecy Act compliance are spurring banks and other financial services firms to use intelligence and anomaly detection to more proactively detect suspicious activity.

""Many of the major banks have actually developed intelligence divisions alongside their anti-money-laundering compliance groups, that are composed of former military and law enforcement intelligence officers, to conduct data analytics, to make sure that they're looking at trends in the transaction activity that is proactive, and not simply reactive, to identify any potential nexus or contact with known terrorist organizations,"" she says. ""So it's taking on a new level of both financial commitment and resource commitment at many global banks.""

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in August proposed rules that would require investment advisers, including certain hedge funds and private fund managers, to establish anti-money-laundering programs and report suspicious activity - basically requiring that investment advisers comply with the same Bank Secrecy Act requirements as banks and other financial entities. And in December, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced proposals for new AML and terrorist financing regulations that would require senior financial executives to certify the effectiveness of AML systems.

New York's proposed regulatory oversight aims to address perceived shortcomings in Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs, Resnick says.

During this interview (see audio link below photo), Resnick also discusses:

Why regulators want to see banks investing in ""meaningful"" transactions monitoring that uses a rules-based approach;
How AML departments and staff are viewed as being more critical to business operations than they were three years ago; and
Why steep BSA fines have helped AML departments acquire bigger budgets to fund transaction monitoring systems.

Resnick is a member of the white collar and corporate investigations team at the law firm BakerHostetler. She is regularly retained by executive management and audit committees of Fortune 500 corporations to conduct internal investigations on FCPA; AML; trade sanctions and OFAC; securities fraud; accounting; and employment matters, and to provide advice about cybercrime issues. She was a two-time recipient of the Department of Justice Director's Award for Superior Performance.",nam

Jump to navigation Jump to search

Ukraine is divided into several levels of territorial entities. On the first level there are 27 regions: [1]

24 oblasts
one autonomous republic
two cities with special status [2]

Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, Crimea and Sevastopol came under the de facto administration of the Russian Federation, which claims them as the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol. Internationally, most states have not recognised the Russian claims.

Ukraine directly inherited its administrative divisions from the local republican administration of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the overall structure has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century. It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various populated places, particularly cities.

According to the Article 133 of Constitution of Ukraine, ""the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages."" Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city. [3]

Ukraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:

By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).
By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.
By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of prime level (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of middle level (districts, cities with district division), and of higher level (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).
Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.

Regions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the cabinet of ministers. [4] Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality  vykonkom) and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.

Ukraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: oblast (region), raion (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the Ukrainian parliament. The following table is based on the 2001 Ukrainian Census. [5]

Table (after 2020)[ edit ]

Following the 2020 administrative reform all populated places in Ukraine (except for Kyiv and Sevastopol) were resubordinated to districts.

List[ edit ]

The following numbers are based on the 2001 Ukrainian Census. [5]

Top level (Regions, 27): [3]

Autonomous Republic of Crimea
Oblasts of Ukraine (24)
Cities with special status: Kyiv and Sevastopol

Middle level (Regional subdivision, 786):

Raions (490)
Cities of oblast significance (178)

Cities of raion significance (276)
Urban-type settlements (?????? ???????? ????) (885)
Villages (????) (27,190)

History[ edit ]

Main articles: Administrative divisions development in Ukraine and Ukrainian historical regions

Before the introduction of oblasts in 1932, Ukraine comprised 40 okruhas, which had replaced the former Russian Imperial guberniya (governorate) subdivisions.

In 1932 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was re-established based on oblasts. Excluded in the administrative changes was Western Ukraine, which at that time formed part of the Second Polish Republic and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on voivodeships.

In the post- World War II period, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic consisted of 25 oblasts and two cities with special status.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.

First-level administrative divisions[ edit ]

Autonomous republic[ edit ]

Main article: Autonomous Republic of Crimea

The Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine. Its capital is Simferopol. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.

On March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a subject into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262 by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.

Oblasts[ edit ]

Main article: Oblasts of Ukraine

Oblasts are on the first (top) level of the administrative division of Ukraine.

Almost every oblast is named after its administrative center, except for four oblasts. Volyn' and Zakarpattia, whose respective capitals are Lutsk and Uzhhorod, are named after historic regions Volhynia and Transcarpathia. The administrative centers of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Kirovohrad Oblast were renamed to Dnipro and Kropyvnytskyi in 2016, however as of 2017 the oblasts still officially bear the old soviet names as their change must be reflected in an amendment to the Ukrainian Constitution.

Each oblast is administered by a governor.

Main article: Cities with special status

Two cities carry special status: the city of Kyiv which is the capital of Ukraine and the city of Sevastopol. Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, Sevastopol is controlled by Russia and is incorporated as a federal subject of Russia. It is recognized as a part of Ukraine by most of the international community.

Second-level administrative units[ edit ]

Raions[ edit ]

Main article: Raions of Ukraine

Raions are smaller territorial units of subdivision in Ukraine. There are 136 raions. [7] According to December 2019 draft constitutional changes submitted to the Verkhovna Rada by President Volodymyr Zelensky united territorial communities are planned to replace the raions of Ukraine. [8]

Third-level administrative units[ edit ]

Further information: Populated places in Ukraine

The Dnieper River plays an important part in Ukrainian territorial division, with many large cities settled on its banks. Here, the capital city of Kyiv which was founded on the Dnieper's right bank but for now expanded over the river significantly.

Ukraine has two types of settlements: rural and urban. Rural populated areas (????????? ????????? ?????) can be either a village (????, selo) or a rural settlement (??????). Urban populated areas (??????? ????????? ?????) can be either a city (????o) or an urban-type settlement (?????? ???????? ????). For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the English language.

Changes to a settlement's status can be made only by the Verkhovna Rada. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of Prypiat still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.

The typical Ukrainian misto ought to be considered a city, not a town (compare to City status in the United Kingdom). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the political sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.

According to Ukrainian law a city (?????) in Ukraine is a locality of at least 10,000 people. [10] Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of regional (oblast) importance, and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of Kyiv and of Sevastopol have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a city with a special status, which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the President of Ukraine. However, the status of the mayor of Kyiv is somewhat more complex, and for further information see Legal status and local government of Kyiv. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.

Almost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into city raions which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.

Many raions also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.

Other municipalities[ edit ]

In addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the Verkhovna Rada.

Main article: Amalgamated hromada

The smalgamated hromadas (Ukrainian: ??'?????? ????????????? ???????, Obyednana terytorial?na hromada) are part of administrative reform that started in 2015. It is intended to replace all councils (local level territorial units). In his draft constitutional amendments of June 2014 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and ""hromadas"". [11]

On February 5, 2015, the law ""On voluntary association of territorial communities"" was adopted creating united territorial communities meaning settlement councils, rural councils and a city of district significance can create a new administrative unit. [12] Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada. [13] New local elections in these united territorial communities were then held. [14] 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019. [15] The first 252 were held in 2017. [16]

The Law ""On Local Self-Government in Ukraine"" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies. [17] Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit amalgamated hromada was created. [17]

Other administrations[ edit ]

Ukraine also has several settlements known as viiskove mistechko which were former military installations. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the secrecy of such settlements has been unveiled, however, the towns are subordinated directly to the Ministry of Defense and do not have their own civil administrations. Such military installations are like ghost towns that are not even identified on a map. One of them, on the border of the Kyiv and Zhytomyr Oblasts is Makarov-1. [18]

A special territory known as the zone of alienation falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Emergencies and was the most severely affected territory by the Chernobyl disaster. Additionally, various restricted nature preserves known as Zapovednik fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ecology.

Due to the War in Donbass, the status of civilmilitary administrations was created in territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts where the respective local government units cannot exercise their constitutionally guaranteed powers. [19]

Currently, Ukraine has the following 3 enclaves:

The city of Slavutych which is administratively subordinated directly to Kyiv Oblast while being completely surrounded by neighboring Chernihiv Oblast.
The settlement of Bile which is located on Snake Island and is fully surrounded by the Black Sea was established in 2007 and is part of Vylkove, Odessa Oblast. [20]
The town of Kotsiubynske which is part of the Kyiv Oblast and is completely surrounded by the city of Kyiv.

Metropolitan areas[ edit ]

Ukraine has five major agglomerated metropolitan areas (conurbations). These conurbation areas are not officially recognized and remain to be administered according to official oblast - raion system of subdivision.

Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) geographic division of Ukraine used in their polls.

Beside the administrative divisions, geographical divisions are at times used for reference or statistical purposes. The division splits Ukraine into 4 to 6 geographic areas: Western Ukraine, Eastern Ukraine, Southern Ukraine, Central Ukraine, Northern Ukraine (occasionally used).

The neighboring countries such as Russia, Poland, Hungary and Romania sometimes identify certain parts of Ukraine. For example, Russia has territorial claims to Ukraine stating that the Southeastern Ukraine is part of Russia, [ citation needed ] certain political or public figures in Poland lay territorial claims to western Ukraine identifying them as Borderlands or Kreis (Kresy), [ citation needed ] the same goes for Hungary that calls Zakarpattia Oblast as Kárpátalja.

Since then he has been a trainee at the European Commission Anti-Fraud Office as well as a freelance development researcher.

Introduction

Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have found that counter-terrorist financing (CTF) rules have been interpreted and implemented by national governments and banks in a way which has delayed aid and put NGO staff at greater security risk. In response to civil society concerns, the global standard setting body for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorist financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), revised its approach in October 2016 to reflect civil society organisations concerns.

Charities had originally been classified as particularly vulnerable to abuse by terrorists by FATF, although this classification was recently removed. The abuse that FATF and others have been concerned about can take various forms: from fake NGOs to legitimate organisations being defrauded to acquire or channel money. Partners or suppliers might also be set up or abused by terrorists. The rules are intended to make organisations take reasonable steps to check that funds are not being diverted. It is important for an NGO (as for any organisation) to demonstrate due diligence, meaning that they have good systems in place to detect terrorist financing. There is an obligation to report if an organisation suspects funds have been diverted to terrorists.

In this blog, I will briefly outline the security risks that aid workers can and have faced due to counter-terrorist financing measures, and go on to describe the international mechanism through which CTF measures are developed and evaluated. I will go on to outline the recent changes to CTF recommendations and what this might mean for humanitarian NGOs.

What are the security concerns?

NGOs have been affected by the way in which states and the private sector have implemented CTF standards, as recommended by FATF and each governments own counter-terrorism policy advisors. One problem has been that authoritarian governments have been able to use CTF to justify the repression of human rights defenders and advocacy organisations operating in their countries. In addition, humanitarian NGOs have seen their banks introduce new measures to comply with CTF legislation, which has resulted in operational and security concerns overseas. This has predominantly manifested itself through:

Banks refusing to transfer funds or keep accounts open in high-risk geographical areas.
The introduction of greater security checks and information requests by banks.

Non-standard money transfer routes

Some banks, not wanting to fall foul of the AML-CTF legislation, have opted to simply not transfer funds to payees in conflict zones and areas where terrorists operate. Some have completely stopped doing business with NGOs and local banks operating in these areas. This action is known as de-risking.

If banks refuse to transfer funds, then some NGOs have opted to use cash couriers leading to the risk of robbery and harm to aid workers transporting cash. Others have started using the informal hawala system, which some NGOs have reported can cause security incidents. It is ironic that the effects of this legislation often push NGOs into more marginal, riskier and less traceable forms of money transfer where it is more likely to be misappropriated on route to beneficiaries.

Beneficiary vetting

Under some legislation, if any terrorist benefits from a service directly or indirectly, this can count as material support to a terrorist group. This could include food or emergency medical care. It has often been pointed out that this contradicts the humanitarian principles that state that aid should be given to all those in need.

As a result of these laws, some banks expect aid organisations to know an unrealistic amount about their beneficiaries, to have a procedure in place to prevent this. Such requests also ignore the guidance from FATF that banks do not need to know their customers customer. Attempting to meet this expectation could be perceived as spying and can cause an NGO to use up scarce resources. Requiring more staff on the ground, for example, has security implications, especially in a conflict zone.

Additionally, if an NGO attempts to meet this request by collecting lists of beneficiaries this could lead to host states asking to see such lists, potentially endangering beneficiaries or creating mistrust if the NGO refuses to share this information. This could affect an NGOs local acceptance and therefore the security of aid staff operating in that geographical area.

Security checks

Some banks have instituted additional security checks before approving the transfer of funds, thus causing delays in implementation that can have serious implications for an NGOs operational security. This delay can also be caused by an NGO not being fully prepared to answer the questions that some banks have posed in a timely manner.

Who makes the rules and what are the recent developments?

FATF is a global intergovernmental body set up to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It makes recommendations, which states then transpose into their own legislation. FATF has developed a series of recommendations that are recognised as the international standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

Many of these rules involve setting standards which the banking industry and other private and non-governmental groups must comply with. In 2016, as a result of advocacy by civil society, FATF revised its recommendation in relation to the non-profit sector and accordingly updated its mutual evaluation methodology, which is used to assess how well countries are implementing these rules. In June 2016, after consultation with the non-profit sector, FATF revised its Recommendation 8 and related interpretive note, which relates to non-profit organisations specifically. The body changed the wording of the recommendation so non-profit organisations were no longer considered particularly vulnerable to terrorist financing schemes. Furthermore, in October 2016, the mutual evaluation methodology was also updated by FATF. Mutual evaluations are one of FATFs main sources of leverage. Bad mutual evaluation scores can lead to a countrys banks being cut off from the international financial system. The most significant changes made to the guidance for evaluation assessors are as follows: Supervision of non-profits should focus on those that the countrys government has identified as being at risk of terrorist financing abuse rather than the whole sector. The guidance now emphasises that such supervision should be focused and proportionate. Assessors will now consider whether legitimate charitable activities are not disrupted or discouraged by measures put in place to counter terrorist financing. Evaluations take about 18 months and ongoing evaluations will continue to use the old criteria. Therefore, it will take some time to see how effective the changes are.

What now?

The changes made by FATF, whilst very significant, are just a first step and will not necessarily lead to automatic changes in national rules. However, there is increasing awareness of the negative effects CTF has had on civil society organisations, particularly those NGOs operating in high terrorism risk areas. For example, in the UK, a working group is being set up between the government and NGOs; Chatham House has published research on the contradictions between CTF/counter-terrorism and international humanitarian law; and Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) are also researching this topic.

Robust rules must be in place to counter financing of terrorism but these rules should not stop aid reaching the millions of victims of terrorism and conflict. Organisations need to be able to securely finance humanitarian operations in a way that minimises unnecessary security risk to aid workers. EISF would like to hear from your organisation if CTF has affected the security of your staff and/or operations. Please e-mail Adelicia (eisf-research@eisf.eu) if you are able to share your experiences.

395,"Financial technology leaders in New York City are keeping calm after learning that Prosper Marketplace lent over $28,000 to the husband and wife who earlier this month killed 14 people in an act of terrorism in San Bernardino, California.

Initially, the unwitting role Prosper played in the terror attack raised a number of concerns in the financial community about whether the loan was evidence of a lax regulatory environment surrounding this new breed of startups that quickly puts borrowers directly in touch with non-bank lenders.

It will definitely be a headline that will be used, Im sure, said Hans Morris, founder of Nyca Investment Capital and a past president of Visa. For my standpoint, it doesnt change the regulatory framework. You have to follow the rules and thats the story.""

Speaking at an industry breakfast this morning in Manhattan, Morris joined others on the panel who argued that existing regulations imposed on traditional banks and startups alike are sufficient. What worried other panelists though is that a push to increase the depth of background checks for loans might eventually violate a potential borrowers right to privacy.

Prosper is a San Francisco-based lender that's raised $354 million venture capital to help borrowers find loans from nontraditional sources. The company lets its lenders browse loan applications, find listings they find desirable, and make loans as small as $25.

On Nov. 18, two weeks before the deadly attacks in San Bernardino, the company loaned over $28,000 to 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers. After performing its due-diligence the loan was originated by Salt Lake City-based Webbank.com, an online-only bank that specializes in originating loans for peer-to-peer transactions, including those arranged by publicly-traded Lending Club (NYSE: LC).

Prosper's role was revealed this week after authorities reported a large deposit had been made to Farook's bank account shortly before the attack. The loan has put not just Prosper on the defensive, but also other alternative lenders who are examining their own lending procedures.

At this morning's breakfast planned before the Dec. 2 attacks took place, Morris and several New York City-based financial technology founders weighed in on the question of whether marketplace lenders need additional oversight. The consensus was that the level of regulation marketplace lenders were expected to follow was at least equal to that of banks.

David Klein, cofounder and CEO of marketplace lending platform CommonBond, said his firm has a multi-tiered identification verification process on all its loans and that every marketplace lender is subjectin principleto the same regulatory requirements.

But in a conversation after the breakfast, he explained that in reality, regulatory considerations are more nuanced across different asset classes. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has student loan examination guidelines that are subtly different than those for mortgages, cars, and other types of loans.

For someone who intends to take out a loan for an illicit or illegal act the most likely type of loan is a personal loan which is generally dispersed directly to the recipient. Other loans for education or to refinance are disbursed directly to the school or existing lender respectively. So a lot of the fraud detection is already build in, said Klein

And so, it's for personal loans that marketplace lenders like CommonBond require verification above that of even many traditional banks by requiring a borrower's bank account information. The data is cross-referenced with third-party databases like account aggregators Yodlee or Plaid to make sure everything matches up.

At this stage of the investigation many of the details of the loan have not been released to the press, including what type of loan was given. According to Klein, The only answer weve been able to find so far is that everything was done by the books and whether this happened at Prosper or JP Morgan, you would have the same outcome, he said.

Alex Sion, co-founder of alt-banking company Moven, said his consumer-focused company actually requires a higher barrier to entry than a traditional bank to get a credit card. Most of us do more than physically centered lenders or banks, said Sion, who is also the company's president. It would be a bad place if we got to this point where were starting to question digital progress because of one incident.

Up until this attack, the conventional wisdom surrounding how terrorists got funds for their acts focused on traditional banks, old-fashioned gold and cutting-edge cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In March, the House Committee on Financial Services announced the creation of a bipartisan task force to investigate terrorism financing with a goal to shut down illicit banks. Then in May, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a report suggesting that terrorists were moving to gold as a result of clamping down on traditional banks.

And last month, after terrorists connected to the Islamic State (ISIS) mounted coordinated attacks in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, the European Commission released a memo outlining plans to assess the role bitcoin may have played, according to a Coinbase report. Earlier this week finance ministers in the European Union announced plans to create centralized bank-account registers to make it easier for police to investigate terrorist funding in traditional banks.

Klein's biggest concern is that those in the United States who want to see deeper background checks might push for an increased level of scrutiny that could eventually lead to privacy violations. If there's a way to increase security that doesn't violate the principles and philosophy of this country Klein says he welcomes change. Otherwise, regulators inspired by this event should tread lightly.

""Do you, do I, do we want the government to look at our Google searches?"" he asked. ""You could argue they do right now  but use Google searches for credit decisions? I think in this country in particular, thats a really slippery slope and thats what I think makes this question a good question to ask. My hope is that it goes in a positive and productive direction.""

Already today, The House Financial Services Committee began an inquiry to look into whether marketplace lending needed additional regulation, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Jon Stein, CEO of New York City-based robo-advising firm Betterment, closed out the panel by shifting the focus away from financial regulation altogether.

I would see it as a real lack of leadership,"" Stein said, ""and a lack of good vision and narrative if what we took away from this was that the problem is access to capital, rather than the access to firearms.""",nam
396,"A little cynicism can go a long way to protect yourself from fraud.

Millions of people become victims of countless forms of fraud each year. Scott Matteson, educator with Michigan State University Extension, says that, Criminals use the phone, email, postal mail and the internet to lure you into sending money, purchasing products or investments, or giving out personal information. There are always new ways criminals try to get their hands on your money, so its important to know some basic facts about the fraud.

What can you do to avoid investment fraud?

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission suggest that consumers should take the following steps to avoid investment fraud:

Ask questions and do your own research. For more about information, see Ask Questions. You can also check out many investments by searching EDGAR.
Know the salesperson. Always find out whether the securities salespeople who contact you are licensed to sell securities in your state and whether they or their firms have had run-ins with regulators or other investors. You can check out the disciplinary history of brokers and advisers for free using the SECs and FINRAs online databases. Your state securities regulator may have additional information.
Be suspicious of unsolicited offers. It could be a  pump and dump  scheme or affinity fraud. As you have heard, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Protect yourself online. For tips on how to do this, see Protect Your Social Media Accounts.

The Financial Fraud and Fraud Susceptibility in the United States research report prepared by Applied Research & Consulting LLC says that financial fraud solicitations are common, it is difficult for most consumers to identify the classic red flags of fraud and older people face the greatest risk from investment fraud.

Take a moment to use the Financial Industry Regulatory Authoritys Risk Meter to see if you may be vulnerable to investment fraud.

If you have a question or concern about an investment, or you think you have been a victim of fraud, please contact the SEC or your state securities regulator to report the fraud and to get assistance. Michigan residents should contact the Department of Insurance and Financial Services.

397,"COLUMBUS (AP)  Any potential comeback by ex-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder wont go unchallenged.

The once-powerful Republican said last week that unfinished business on policy matters has him considering a return run for the district including his Perry County home.

In a district where the winner of the Republican primary will almost certainly land the seat, a three-way GOP primary is shaping up. Coshocton City Council President Cliff Biggers is already running and a second GOP contender, local businessman Randal Almendinger, is circulating petitions.

Both Almendinger and Householder have until Dec. 16 to file.

High interest in the seat shows top Republicans arent clearing the way for Householders victory. Supporters have said Householder would bring valuable skill and experience to the Statehouse, but his detractors say he led an era of heavy-handed politics that shouldnt be repeated.

Householder, 56, left Columbus a decade ago amid a federal investigation into allegations of money laundering and irregular campaign practices.

An anonymous, nine-page memo leaked to the FBI, IRS and then-Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in 2004 accused the House Republican Campaign Committee that Householder oversaw of overpaying vendors, then having those vendors make secret payments back to Householder and his advisers.

Householder said at the time the memo contained half-truths and outright lies. After a two-year investigation, the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute.

If he runs, Householder would join a group of seasoned Republican lawmakers seeking to return to the House next year. They include Senate President Keith Faber and state Sens. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, Tom Patton of Cleveland, Jim Hughes of Columbus and possibly Chris Widener of Springfield.

All served under Householder when he was speaker, potentially giving him critical mass to seek another speakership. Householder insists hes not going for the job.

He is, however, working to line up support for getting back to the Statehouse. Powerful retired lobbyist John Mahaney, of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said he supports the effort.

Larry is a very hard-working, loyal guy. I thought he did a nice job as speaker, he said. His staff didnt do him any favors, but he himself certainly was four-square with me. His word was his bond, as I prided myself at having mine be over the years. Also, were a couple of hillbillies  him from Glenford, me from Zanesville  so we got along.

Mahaney noted some storied Ohio politicians  including late Republican Gov. James Rhodes and the late Democratic House Speaker Vern Riffe  hailed from Appalachia. But the district Householder is eyeing has been redrawn to be more urban and less rural since Householder last served, so its unclear whether it would be so easy to win.

Biggers, who is black, may attract campaign and financial help from his party since he would lend some desired diversity to the nearly all-white House Republican caucus. He is a retired police detective and pastor of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Coshocton.

Almendinger is a Republican party insider well-known in Licking County, where he owns newspapers, a commercial cleaning company and a real estate company and has served in public roles including school board and township trustee.

Householder has served as Perry County commissioner and auditor. He was speaker from 2001 to 2004.",nam
398,"Stephen Baldwin, 43, has 18 tattoos. ""They represent various moments in my life,"" he says. ""Whether it be showing my love for my woman in a very macho way  there are three of those  to the ones which express my commitment to sobriety. I have one for my children. The 3.30 one on the back of my neck is the time I'm supposed to be home! No, it's a scripture in the Bible that I feel compelled to remind myself of: John 3.30. ""I must decrease so that he may increase."" It's about consciousness of humility. I'm walking this walk and my life has nothing to do with my perception of the world. It's all God! How do I function within His plan?""

How, indeed? Nestled amid these lofty body adornments, at the top of Stephen's left shoulder, are two small letters: HM. They stand for Hannah Montana. Miley Cyrus joked that she would get him a cameo in her Hannah Montana series if he got the tattoo and Stephen, a man who relishes a challenge, went straight out and did it.

""Hey, it's just one more,"" he shrugs. ""And I have a beverage company that produces an energy shot, a Red Bull-type drink, called Hit Me. So I can say that the HM stands for Hit Me. Hit me! I'm fuelled on adrenaline with a chaser of the Holy Ghost! Yeeeeah!""

Stephen Baldwin is a character. Even his tattoos are bananas. The youngest and, some say, dumbest of the Baldwin brothers is a pumped-up ball of energy, a glitter-eyed alpha male, a charismatic Christian, a proper laugh. He charms everyone that wanders into his light. When he drops off his washing at a Camden launderette  ""How are you all today, ladies?""  he has the manageress eating out of his hand. ""Some of these nice jumpers we'll have to keep out of the tumble dryer,"" she offers; she has no idea who he is. But her young nephew, who's wearing a hoodie emblazoned with Playboy Mansion Security, is thrilled to see the Celebrity Big Brother star. Stephen beckons him over.

""Hey buddy,"" he stage whispers. ""I've been to four of those Playboy parties. And you know what? They weren't so great."" The lad flushes pink with excitement.

It's the Sunday after Stephen's Friday-night eviction from the Big Brother house. He's not had much sleep since: after the show, he went out with Sisqo, his fellow evictee, to Old Compton Street tourist trap Balans, of all places, where they hooked up with CBB ex-housemates Lady Sovereign and Kat. Then, last night, he trekked to an internet cafe at 3am so he could co-host his religious radio programme, Baldwin/McCullough Xtreme Radio, which goes out live every Saturday evening to 195 stations across the US. He didn't go to sleep until six in the morning.

Still, there's not much evidence of tiredness when we meet, in the restaurant of his hotel. It's nearly noon and Stephen is running late for his appearance on Big Brother's Little Brother. He avails himself of the breakfast buffet at a leisurely pace. ""The car they've sent has a flat tyre,"" says the PR, ""so we're OK for a few minutes."" Stephen says: ""See this? This is MOR-TA-DEL-LA. We need to make time for this.""

There is an enormous Bible on the table. Stephen takes it everywhere; he specified in his Big Brother contract that he be allowed to read it for an hour a day while in the house, despite there usually being a blanket ban on reading material.

""I ain't going in the House of Hell without my sword!"" he trumpets. ""I only look stupid And there wasn't much to do, so guess what? The Bible readings became a big thing! I'm like, 'Wait a minute: I'm not holding a Bible study class while the whole world watches, am I?' I spoke with everyone about God, except for Vinnie.""

Actually, Stephen  Stevie B, as he refers to himself  is convinced that he saw the devil while he was in Big Brother, working from within two of the housemates. (He won't tell me which, though I'd guess at mild Nicola T and dimbo Dane Bowers, both remarkably undemonic.) Whatever, the devil popped up and Stevie B spotted the ­little rascal.

""Demons manifest themselves in people in different ways,"" he says seriously. ""For instance, out of nowhere, somebody can become very angry for no ­reason. That's not just an emotion. That's a demon.""

Stephen tried to talk about this with other housemates, but they didn't seem that bothered that some of their members were possessed. So he consulted with God, and came to this conclusion: the Holy Spirit is allowing Stephen to see certain things ""BUT! If I mentioned it, it would destroy my credibility in the house. Satan would be using my knowledge that he exists against me! I can't reveal the truth! This,"" muses Stephen, ""is gnarly warfare.""

""Give me 120 seconds,"" he says to the PR and nips over to talk to two British people that he met in the hotel lobby yesterday. They're from Yorkshire and invite him to accompany them to see Leeds replay Tottenham in the FA Cup in a few days' time. ""Sure!"" says Stephen. He has spoken, and so it shall be.

We take a cab to the Big Brother house, in Elstree. On the way, Stephen talks about his family. Born in a small town on Long Island, New York, he's one of six children  two girls, Elizabeth and Jane, and four now-famous boys: Alec, Billy, Danny, Stephen. Their Catholic parents were respected community members  his dad was a schoolteacher, his mum founded a breast cancer care centre  and the Baldwin brothers were popular: ""Badly behaved, outspoken, famous-in-our-town, dumb jocks."" Stephen was the baby, his mum's favourite: ""Like Michael Jackson in the Jackson 5 years, with confidence in my charm and a belief in my ability to be entertaining.""

Alec, then and now the leader of the Baldwins, became president of his school's student body, followed by Billy and Jane. He studied acting at NYU and, in 1980, Alec got a role in a daytime soap called The ­Doctors. The other boys ­followed, landing modelling and acting jobs through, says Stephen, ""chutzpah, personality, drive and a belief that anything's achievable"". Everything came easily to the confident ­Baldwin ­brothers.

Up until he found the Lord, Stephen worked pretty solidly as an actor, his ­biggest roles being in mid-90s ­movies The Usual Suspects and Bio-Dome; though he nearly blew his career early on, by getting heavily involved with ­alcohol and cocaine. He first took coke at his high school prom. But he was clean and out of rehab by the age of 23, having met his Brazilian wife, Kennya, when he was 19. They married in 1990 and have two girls, Alaia, who's just turned 17, and Hailey, 13.

Kennya has been instrumental in Stephen's conversion from Catholicism to born-again Christian. When Alaia was first born, Kennya hired a Brazilian woman, Augusta, as a housekeeper. As she worked, Augusta kept singing about Jesus and Kennya asked why: Augusta replied that her local church in Brazil had told her that she should take the job with the Baldwins because, if she did, they would become believers and have their own ministry. Kennya told Stephen. He laughed.

Some time later, Kennya became born again. ""I gave my life to the Lord tonight, she said,"" remembers Stephen. ""I said, 'That's awesome.'"" But it involved more than he expected: every day Kennya would get up and pray silently for two hours, her face pressed to the floor. She did the same thing every night, as well as study her Bible for 45 ­minutes. After around nine months, Stephen joined in, though he didn't really feel the force until 9/11 and the collapse of the Twin Towers.

""I live in New York. And I thought, 'What's up with that?' It was the prophetic, supernatural, spiritual impact of 9/11. Something shifting for no logical reason  well, then, Jesus Christ could come back for real. Things are no longer as they were before. Now the impossible is possible. And if the impossible is possible, and a woman came and told my wife that we would lead a ministry""

Stephen was convinced that 9/11 was a sign from the Lord. Which it may have been, though it's hard to believe that God caused all that tragedy just to inform one fairly successful actor that he should jack in his career and start skateboarding for Jesus. But anyway, Stephen set up a company called Global Breakthrough Ministry and staged a very popular arena tour around the US, which mixed extreme sports and evangelism. A spin-off video called Livin It, which he directed, has gone on to sell 500,000 copies.

Opportunities kept coming: he did a tour of churches, hooked up with Kevin McCullough and started his radio show, wrote two books, set up an outreach service to help members of the US armed forces. Over the past few years, however, he says he's tried to calm down and listen to the Lord more  and this, weirdly, has led him to do a series of reality shows in the US, including I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, which he hated, and Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge, which he enjoyed.

We arrive at the Big Brother studio, where Sisqo and Stephen partake gamely in BBLB, with George Lamb taking the mickey out of them throughout. Both Americans are great performers; funny, reactive, quick to get the joke. ""Do I love bootleg jeans? Sure I do,"" booms Stephen, and flips up his trouser hem to reveal his iPhone tucked into his sock. ""I'm from New York! It's a great place to hide a small 38 revolver!""

Stephen got £150,000 for the show. Which sounds a lot, but he went bankrupt last year, owing $824,488.36 in unpaid mortgage and an unspecified amount, believed to be over $2m, to the IRS: ""I didn't plan for a rainy day. I didn't know the Jesus freak thing was on the horizon!"" A casting director told him recently that he'd been put up for three different films, but each time, the director said no, specifically because Stephen can't keep quiet about his faith. Anyway, he tells me, he can't do the films he used to, because of the gratuitous violence, bad language and sex. If he were offered The Usual Suspects today  which is unlikely  he would have to say no.

Off we go again, this time to Nigel Hall on Floral Street, where a stylist whizzes Stephen in and out of some nice clothes. (He can't be that skint: the discount comes to over £1,500.) Stephen is a laugh throughout. ""Take a picture!"" he says, and organises it so he's in the best light. ""My wife will rape me in this outfit. Rape. Me."" He keeps ­telling me not to quote him when he uses what he thinks is louche language, such as ""balls"": being a Christian, for him as for many Americans, means he has to stick to a rigidly conservative agenda. It impacts directly on his life: his father-in-law, who divorced Kennya's mum nine years ago, is not allowed in Stephen's house with his girlfriend. It would be OK if they were married, but until that happens, ""until he is acting in a way we feel acceptable according to our faith"", then no.

Our final stop is a small shop in ­Kensington, where a service for the Every Nation Church is being held. Earnest, smiley young people sit on cushions to hear their pastor speak. They sit a lot longer for Stephen's talk: once he starts, he can't stop, telling them the story of his conversion, dragging it out for giggles, relishing his chance to speak freely about his faith without Vinnie Jones butting in. It's 45 minutes of fun. Stephen is a remarkably likable man, I think.

But then, the day after, we speak again on the phone and I ask him what he'd do if one of his girls came out as a lesbian and the other became a stripper. ""Jesus or no Jesus, if my kid started working in a strip club, I'd beat her ass,"" he hoots. ""Now, the other question is interesting and culturally relevant. I have two or three very dear friends who are homosexual and they know I'm born again and we have an understanding that we're just not going there""

I'm not surprised. For the next 20 minutes, we have an intense discussion  argument, really  during which Stephen reveals that he's all for gay men who, through their faith, reject their homosexuality and get married: ""To turn away from that lifestyle is astonishing."" Yes, Stephen, it is. And he's definitely not for gay marriage.

What about civil partnerships, I ask wearily.

""I believe that the family unit has fundamentally been the most positive thing for society and I don't believe that any minority has the right to create changes that impact on the majority. That's really the only issue for me.""

And so Stephen and I part company, both feeling disappointed in each other. It's a shame, but it's one of those things. You can really like someone, but when you disagree so decisively on the way you should treat others, you can never really be friends. Honestly, what is it about American born-again Christians that makes them so intolerant? ­Whatever happened to loving thy ­neighbour?",nam
399,"Gaston Alfonso Browne (born 9 February 1967) is the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He has been the islands' leader since 2014. Before entering politics, he was a banker and businessman.

Browne was born on 9 February 1967, in Villa/Point Area on the twin island of Antigua and Barbuda. [2] [3] His life as a teenager was extremely tough. As a child, he lived in Gray's Farm with his paternal great-grandmother, who was in her eighties, at the time, partially blind, poor and aging. After her passing, he later grew up in Point, another impoverished area. [2]

As a child, he attended the Villa Primary School and later the Princess Margaret School after successfully passing the nation's common entrance examination. After completing his secondary education, Gaston attended the City Banking College in the United Kingdom, where he graduated with a BSc in banking and finance. Later, he attended University of Manchester, acquiring an MBA in Finance. [4] [5] [6]

Career[ edit ]

Following graduation Browne secured a position with the Swiss American Banking Group, a major banking consortium in Antigua and Barbuda, comprising offshore and onshore banks and a trust company, eventually rising to the position of Commercial Banking Manager.

He entered the political arena in 1999, when he was elected to parliament for the constituency of St. John's City West. He was appointed Minister of Planning, Trade, Industry, Commerce and Public Service Affairs in his first term as an MP. [ citation needed ]

Prime Minister[ edit ]

Gaston Browne led the Antigua Labour Party to victory in the 12 June 2014 general election, after 10 years in opposition, winning 14 out of 17 seats. Browne was sworn in as Prime Minister on 13 June 2014. [7] He defeated Baldwin Spencer 's UPP, which had ruled for 10 years.

Aftermath of Hurricane Irma[ edit ]

On 6 September 2017 Hurricane Irma swept through Barbuda. Gaston Browne stated that the Category 5 storm had destroyed 95% of the structures and vehicles. [8] Initial estimates showed that at least 60% of the island's residents were homeless because of the disaster. [9] All communications with Barbuda were completely down for a time; most of the communications system had been destroyed. [10]

On 8 September 2017, Browne described the situation as follows during an interview. ""Barbuda right now is literally a rubble"" with no water or phone service; he said there had been only a single fatality. [11] The government had almost completed the evacuation of the entire island; nearly 1,800 people were transferred to Antigua. [12]

On the same day, the first of three cargo planes arrived from the US, with over 120,000 pounds of relief for Barbuda. The cost was covered by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and by donations from Martin Franklyn and the Coleman Company in the US. [13] Also on 8 September, Browne discussed Barbuda's urgent needs with Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for International Development. USAID had already sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team and would continue to coordinate with the government and relief organizations. [14]

Browne's government was facing a massive challenge. An estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Antigua and Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that ""all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent  food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management"". He summarised the situation as follows: ""Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety ... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this."" [15]

Browne is married to Maria Bird-Browne, niece of the second Prime Minister Lester Bird. [16] The couple have a son, Prince Gaston Browne, [5] who was Browne's fourth child, as he had three children prior to marriage. They had a second child, a daughter, in September 2020. [17]

On 11 December, it was announced that Maria would stand as a candidate for Antigua Labour Party in the St John's Rural East constituency. [18] She won the seat in the March 2018 election. [19]",nam

Robert Frank, one of the most influential photographers of the 20th Century, has died at the age of 94.

Frank, who was born in Switzerland but emigrated to the United States in 1947, was best known for his work The Americans - a book which chronicled his 10,000-mile journey across America at the height of the Cold War,

First published in France and then in the US. It was widely condemned by critics, as it depicted a country sharply at odds with the America portrayed by Hollywood and the ad men.

Earl A Powell III, art historian and museum director, said the work showed ""a people plagued by racism, often ill-served by their politicians, intoxicated with the media and celebrities, and infatuated with speed, movement, and even the road itself"".

Frank shot on a small 35mm camera without a motor, so unlike today where you'd find near identical frames sides by side, his contact sheets reveal how he has moved through the crowd, seizing moments of interest.

Ultimately, The Americans is a book that flows from front to back, a visual poem where sequencing was all important.

Frank's loose style broke the mould. He shot around 28,000 images that were edited down to 83 for a book that rewrote the rules of photo-journalism.

Beat poet Jack Kerouac wrote in the preface to the book's US edition, Frank ""sucked a sad poem right out of America on to film.""

Frank went on to make a number of films, including a documentary about the Rolling Stones 1972 tour of America which the group banned from being shown as it captured moments of drug taking.

""He never crossed over into celebrity,"" said photographer Nan Goldin. ""He's famous because he made a mark. He collected the world.""

Both of his children have passed away, his daughter was killed in a plane crash aged just 20 and his son Pablo took his own life in 1994.

But Frank will be remembered as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century and beyond.

401,"Australian Public Service Commissioner John Lloyd is a glass half full kind of guy.

The Australian Public Service now has numerically fewer employees who are either indigenous or have a disability than a year ago  but the agency responsible for fostering and reporting on workplace diversity has still managed to extract a positive statistic to put the figures in a favourable light.

Thats the scenario that comes with the release of the annual State of the Service report this week, the Australian Public Service Commissions annual update on the progress and challenges of the federal bureaucracy that this year heavily rationed the way it delivered and displays official information and statistics.

Like the public service, the annual report on it has been substantially shrunk and now weighs-in at slimline 63 pages from cover to cover with plenty of room for colourful big picture infographics favoured by consumer marketers over traditional tables of hard numbers.

It might be more user friendly as a top-line read, but dont bother digging around for the details to stand-up up carefully crafted claims like the representation of Indigenous people in APS rising over the past year.

According to the State of the Service report Indigenous people as a proportion of ongoing employees was 2.5 per cent in 2014, rising to 2.6 per cent in 2015.

Although the 0.1 per cent increase just scrapes over the positivity line, the actual number of Indigenous employees actually fell by 55 people according to the more nerdy APS Statistical Bulletin that lists actual headcount numbers rather than just percentages.

According to the APS Statistical Bulletin there were 3607 Indigenous ongoing employees in 2014; that number that fell to 3552 in 2015.

The most likely reason for the technical percentage increase in workplace diversity is that the public service as a whole shed a total of 5526 employees in the 2014  2015 financial year according to the Statistical Bulletin.

Another way of looking the numbers is that proportionally fewer Indigenous public servants left their jobs than non-indigenous public servants, not exactly a feelgood statement.

According to the Statistical Bulletins tables, since total public service numbers peaked at 167,339 in 2012, the APS has cut a massive 14,909 jobs to arrive at the most recent number of 152,430  a number last seen in 2007.

The Statistical Bulletin does firmly caution that its diversity data is supplied to agencies by individuals on a voluntary basis.

As with any large voluntary data collection, APSED [Australian Public Service Employee Database] data tends to under-represent the number and proportion of Indigenous Australians, people with disability, and employees from a non-English speaking background (NESB) in the APS, it says.

Even so, they are the same numbers from which the APSC extracts its percentages. To strictly compare apples with apples, the diversity data is based on ongoing APS employees.

For 2015, the total number of ongoing employees came in at 136, 498. Thats 8930 fewer than 2014 when it stood at 144,888.

There are also fewer people with a disability working in the public service. Yet the percentage movement on representation is also nominally positive . . . and eerily similar.

Representation of people identifying with disability in the APS is at 3.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from 2014, the State of the Service report says.

However with disability it does acknowledge the actual numbers have retreated and the reason why

There has been a decline in the actual number of people with disability in the APS from 4,918 in 2014 to 4,778 in 2015. This is due to changes in the structure of the APS and the overall lower number of employees, the State of the Service report says.

Thats a net loss 140 employees with a disability  but still a boost for representation.

Corruption overstated?

One reporting topic the APSC doesnt appear too happy about is the thorny issue of corruption. That could be because as employee numbers are falling, corruption numbers appear to be rising.

Like productivity, the APSC seems to favour a tight conceptual definition of the term corruption lest people become unduly alarmed over the full percentage point increase in perceived corruption.

The definition of corruption, which was changed in this years employee census, may have contributed to the increase in perceived corruption ?from 2.6 per cent in 2013?14 to 3.6 per cent in 2014?15, the State of the Service report helpfully explains.

Similar to results from 2013?14, a large majority of employees witnessing corruption reported witnessing cronyism and nepotism.

The APSC has also taken a curious swing at what warrants corrupt behaviour after agencies told it that 100 of the 557 finalised Code of Conduct investigations for 2014-15 involved corrupt behaviour. Thats a little under 20 per cent.

The types of corrupt behaviour included inappropriate use of flex time; misuse of personal leave to undertake paid employment; conflict of interest on selection panels; theft; and misuse of duties to gain a personal benefit, the State of the Service Report said.

The relatively minor nature of many of these reported matters may be inconsistent with what is understood in the community by the term corruption. Nevertheless, misconduct of this kind still warrants appropriate attention and action.

Appropriate is a relative term. Former NSW anti-corruption commissioner David Ipp has advocated for the creation of the equivalent of a Federal ICAC, an idea that seems to have mnore support outside Canberra than within it.

The APSC stresses that its working hard on integrity.

The Commission is supporting the whole-of-government approach to integrity, including anti-corruption measures. Training in integrity and anti-corruption continues to be an element of the APS Leadership and Core Skills Strategy and associated learning programs, the State of the Service report says.

402,"Statement of Christine Beerli, ICRC Vice-President at the 17th edition Bruges Colloquium , 20 -21 october 2016

Terrorism is a scourge to which the international community has been striving to respond for decades. The obvious challenges it poses are not only long-lasting, but also immediate. Wherever we turn these days, across the world, we are confronted with increased risks of terrorist acts. Terrorism is a global phenomenon sometimes closely link to armed conflict; and one which the international community is increasingly facing.

Terrorism negates the fundamental principles of humanity as well as the essential principles and objectives of international humanitarian law (IHL). In this regard, the ICRC condemns acts of terrorism, irrespective of their perpetrators, be they committed in or outside an armed conflict, and is deeply distressed by their devastating impact on communities and individuals.

Indeed, every day we see the dramatic consequences of the fight between States and non-State armed groups designated as terrorist, in particular in Africa and in the Levant. Irrespective of the claimed legitimacy of this fight or the causes espoused by or attributed to those involved therein, what we observe in the field is once again the civilian population bearing the brunt of armed violence. Cities are reduced to rubble, civilians are directly attacked, humanitarian and medical personnel, transports and infrastructures are targeted and prevented from fulfilling their functions, the civilian population is deprived of supplies essential for its survival through siege warfare, humanitarian access is denied and, resulting from all of this, hundreds of thousands of people are internally displaced or have fled their country, leaving a home, a job, a plot of land, or even close relatives behind. In the absence of a political solution, compliance with IHL and the fundamental values underpinning this body of law are required more than ever, from all sides, because prohibition of acts of terrorism and other violations of the law are not just binding on non-State armed groups.

The rise of non-state armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism is a growing concern domestically but also internationally. This situation has led States and international organizations to react by tightening existing counterterrorism measures and introducing new ones. Of course, the ICRC does not challenge the necessity of States to take legitimate measures to ensure their security. Nonetheless, while taking such measures to eliminate terrorism, the safeguards protecting human life and dignity must be upheld. In the ICRC's view, the international community must be clear and firm on the need for counterterrorism activities to be conducted in full respect of the protection afforded to all individuals by international law, in particular IHL and human rights law. Such respect is in the interest of the international community, as there is today growing recognition that violations of these bodies of international law may in turn exacerbate the very phenomenon that counterterrorism purports to fight.

Neither armed conflict nor terrorism are new forms of violence. Both have existed for a long time and have, for most part, been understood to be separate phenomena, as demonstrated by the different legal frameworks that regulate them. The perception that armed conflict and terrorism differ and that their respective legal rules are distinct has radically changed since September 2001 and the subsequent launching of the so-called ""global war on terrorism"". Recent years have again seen the rise of non-State armed groups resorting to acts of terrorism and the subsequent engagement of a coalition of States against them. This situation has put the relationship between IHL and the legal framework governing terrorism back into the spotlight and may have even created the perception that there may be a new ""global war on terrorism"" involving a group or groups of unbounded geographical reach.

The recent actions taken by States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist and the correlative counterterrorism discourse in both domestic and international fora have significantly contributed to a blurring of the lines between armed conflict and terrorism and their respective legal frameworks. This is further exacerbated by the fact that, often, counterterrorism instruments include situations of armed conflict in their scope of application. The resultant overlaps and contradictions between IHL and the legal instruments specifically designed to address terrorism is problematic. Counterterrorism norms may interfere with IHL's regulation of armed violence, notably by prohibiting conduct that is not unlawful under IHL, creating legal confusion and potentially adversely affecting some of the underlying principles of IHL. In this regard, one should carefully study the consequences of such interference and seek creative ways to ensure the integrity of IHL, thereby maintaining its rationale  which is needed more than ever in current armed conflicts.

The fight against terrorism may take various forms, including armed conflict. Determining when IHL applies to particular counterterrorism activities is not an easy enterprise. Not only because some States may tend to deny the applicability of IHL on the basis that non-State armed groups designated as terrorist organizations cannot be considered party to an armed conflict. How, when and where IHL applies to counterterrorism activities still raises important legal questions.

First of all, it is important to recall that any use of force against non-state armed groups designated as terrorist  or against members and affiliates thereof  is not necessarily synonymous with a situation of armed conflict governed by IHL. When armed force is used, only the facts on the ground are relevant for determining the legal classification of a situation of violence. Some situations may be classified as international armed conflicts, others as non-international armed conflicts, while various acts of violence may fall outside any armed conflict due to lack of requisite nexus. In the ICRC's view, this is also true for the fight against terrorism.

Another crucial question relating to IHL applicability is whether non-state armed groups designated as terrorist fulfil the organization criterion for classifying a situation as a non-international armed conflict. This is all the more difficult in view of the myriad of fluid, multiplying and fragmenting armed groups that frequently take part in the fighting. Often, their structure is difficult to understand. In some cases, some form of leadership structure emerges at some point, claiming to unite different armed groups, often based on pledges of allegiances. This raises the question of what link needs to exist between different armed groups in order to consider formerly distinct entities as one party to an armed conflict. The same question also emerges with regard to different groups that join forces transnationally, such as different armed groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group or to Al Qaida.

The spillover of conflicts into neighboring countries, their geographical expanse and their regionalization also appear to have become distinctive features of many contemporary armed conflicts involving non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. The transnational nature of such armed conflict involving a non-state armed group capable of operating in various countries  even non-contiguous ones  directly raises the question of IHL's territorial reach. This is still a much-debated area of the law  in particular when it comes to the applicability of IHL for military operations in the territory of non-belligerent States  that will certainly benefit from your insights.

IHL has been sometimes described  wrongly in the ICRC's view  as a set of rules which hinders the efforts of States to efficiently address their security concerns and fails to provide adequate tools to deal with non-state armed groups designated as terrorist. I am confident that we will be able to dispel some misconceptions in this regard and highlight the fact that, in situations of armed conflict, IHL should not be considered as an obstacle to the fight against terrorism. On the contrary, IHL can be a powerful tool at States' disposal while still providing important protections  complemented by human rights law  for those affected by the armed conflict between States against non-State armed groups designated as terrorist. This added value of IHL is significant in the fields of the use of force and detention.

The phenomenon of the so-called ""foreign fighters""  nationals of one country who travel abroad to fight alongside a non-State armed group in the territory of another State  has increased exponentially over the past few years. In order to quell the threats emanating from foreign fighters, States - in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council - have taken a variety of measures, including the use of force, detention (on terrorism charges, among others), and travel bans.

While most of the measures taken to prevent individuals from joining non-State armed groups or to mitigate the threat they may pose upon return are of a law enforcement nature, the applicability of IHL, where appropriate, should not be overlooked. However, so far, little attention has been paid to how IHL deals with the phenomenon of foreign fighters.

The concept of a ""foreign fighter"" is not a term of art in IHL. The general applicability of IHL to a situation of violence in which such fighters may be engaged does not depend on the nationality of those fighting. It depends only on the facts on the ground and on the fulfilment of certain legal conditions stemming from the relevant norms of IHL, in particular common Articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Conventions. In other words, in situations of armed conflict, IHL will govern the actions of foreign fighters, as well as any actions against them by parties to that conflict, when such actions have a nexus to the armed conflict concerned.

In this regard, it is important to underline that foreign fighters detained in relation to an armed conflict to which the detaining authorities are party must benefit from the protections afforded by the applicable IHL rules, irrespective of the domestic laws that also govern their detention. Unfortunately, States dealing with the phenomenon of foreign fighters tend to shy away from recognizing the applicability of IHL to their detention. Our discussions will certainly allow us to understand why this is so and to clear up the misapprehension that IHL would not allow States to prosecute foreign fighters  a misapprehension which, in the ICRC's views, has no legal basis under IHL.

For nearly a decade the idea that the risk of radicalization potentially leading to violent actions should be addressed though social prevention programs has significantly progressed. Many States are developing and implementing various domestic plans to address the root causes of this phenomenon. These programs are now usually referred as preventing or countering violent extremism (P/CVE). States' understanding that ""terrorism"" must be fought through more than simply military or hard security means is in fact not a new avenue. It is mimicking years of counter-insurgency strategies and stabilization concepts implemented in conflict affected countries. Yet such P/CVE model has gained considerable ground amongst countries confronted to so-called home grown terrorism and the re-occurrence of violent actions against their respective population. In this political context, international organizations, the RC/RC Movement and various civil society actors are being asked to partner with states and support this movement through their existing or specially design programs.

The ICRC does not question the merit of these initiatives which may ultimately contribute to limit the risks of violations and abuses. However, while recognizing the general purpose of P/CVE concept as expressed in the recent UN plan of action that is to address the root cause of extreme violence, one should not underestimate its potential adverse effects on the existing legal protection frameworks. There may be also a risk that humanitarian organizations associated with CVE/PVE programs be seen by some States and non-State actors as politically motivated and therefore incapable to carry out a neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action.

Within the framework of counterterrorism measures, efforts to curb and criminalize all possible direct and indirect support to so-called terrorist organizations have led to increased control and restraint on all activities, including humanitarian activities, that could in any way be seen as providing support to non-State armed groups or individuals designated as terrorists. Consequently, there is a significant risk that such measures, in particular criminal legislation, may further reduce the humanitarian space which the ICRC and other impartial humanitarian organizations need in order to carry out their neutral, independent and impartial activities.

Since 2011, the ICRC has on various occasions shared its concerns that such counter-terrorism measures have the potential to criminalize a range of humanitarian actors and their personnel, and may create obstacles to the funding of humanitarian activities. The unqualified prohibition of acts of ""material support,"" ""services"" and ""assistance to"" or ""association with"" terrorist organizations found in certain criminal laws could, in practice, result in the criminalization of the core activities of impartial humanitarian organizations, and their personnel, that are endeavoring to meet the needs of victims of armed conflicts or situations of violence below the threshold of armed conflict.

In addition, the potential criminalization of humanitarian engagement with non-State armed groups designated as ""terrorist organizations"" and of humanitarian activities carried out in areas controlled by these groups may be said to reflect a non-acceptance of the notion of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action  a notion which the ICRC strives to promote in its operational work in the field.

The ICRC has deployed significant efforts to persuade States to stop legislating against principles they have supported and endorsed through IHL treaties, as well as to ensure that the new legal frameworks being developed as part of counterterrorism strategies do not challenge principled humanitarian action. So far, our work on this crucial issue was not as successful as we had expected, but the ICRC is convinced that stakeholders will understand the necessity to harmonize their policies and legal obligations across the humanitarian and counterterrorism realms.

403,"Ladies and Gentlemengood morning.

Dear President Vega-Serrano, thank you for your kind invitation and all of you for your warm welcome.

It is wonderful to be in Valenciaa city that combines ancient roots with modern architecture, 21 st -century commerce, and some of the worlds best food. This is a community that values innovation and creativity.

I can see that Valencian spirit of innovation here in this room today. Both FATF and the IMF are forward-thinking organizations designed to help our members address some of the most pressing global issues of our time.

We both are deeply committed to supporting countries in building defenses against money laundering and the financing of terrorism through the AML/CFT standards. We both know that these global challenges cannot be resolved by countries working alone.

I am therefore very proud of the close relationship that the IMF and FATF have forged over nearly two decades. This partnership is more important than ever.

There is no doubt that money laundering and terrorist financing can threaten a countrys economic stability, which is why the IMF has become increasingly active in supporting and promoting the AML/CFT efforts of our member countries, based on the FATF standard.

What started as a small endeavor some 20 years ago has become part of our core workfrom analysis and policy advice, to assessing the health and integrity of financial sectors, to providing financial assistance when needed, to helping countries build institutions and increase operational effectiveness.

Together we have come a long way, and together we can build on the progress made so far. Let me highlight three priorities:

Fighting corruption and tax evasion;
Combating the financing of terrorism; and
Maintaining correspondent banking relationships.

1. Fighting corruption and tax evasion

First, we need to intensify our fight against corruption and tax evasion. We will soon release new analysis that shows how systemic corruption can seriously undermine a countrys ability to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.

Large-scale tax evasion is a key factor, because it typically means lower government revenue, higher public debt, and less investment in health, education, and other public services. It means higher economic inequality because the most vulnerable are most affected by a sharp drop in social spending. That, in turn, can trigger popular discontent and economic instability.

The good news is that we can use the AML/CFT framework to help break this vicious economic cycle.

A good example is Greece, where the strengthening of the AML framework facilitated the seizure of hundreds of millions of euros in proceeds from tax crimes.

We helped the central bank strengthen its financial sector supervision, which led to a sharp increase in reporting to the financial intelligence unit. That unit itself froze more than 200 million in assets between 2012 and 2014. The financial intelligence unit also referred more than 400 cases to the prosecutors office and more than 2,500 cases to the tax authorities.

Another area where the FATF standard is immensely helpful is in promoting transparency. The Panama Papers, for example, were a stark reminder of the need to do more in this areasomething that you had already long recognized.

2. Combating the financing of terrorism.

Another policy priority is to combat the financing of terrorism. As terrorism is becoming more pervasive in our societies, it is our collective responsibility to choke off the financial flowsboth large and smallthat enable terrorists to inflict unspeakable suffering on individuals, families, and communities.

Over the past 16 years, we have been involved in this joint effort through our technical assistance and capacity building work.

In 2014, for example, we called on Sudan to strengthen its CFT frameworkand we have since worked with the government there to develop targeted financial sanctions that are consistent with the FATF standard. We are working on a practical guidance for all our members on how to implement such sanctions, which should be available by 2019.

Combating the financing of terrorism increasingly requires harnessing the power of financial technology, or fintech.

Of course, fintech is a double-edged sword. It can be used to promote and fund terrorism, including through the anonymity of virtual currencies. But it can also be a powerful tool to strengthen our defenses against the financing of terrorism.

We can use fintech to identify terrorist financial flows, including in the case of very small transactions. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence tools can help identify patterns of activity that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.

Fintech can also help protect financial systems against cyber-terrorism. A good example is the distributed ledger technology that underpins virtual currencies and other applications. This technology is less vulnerable to a single point of failure and could prove resilient to cyberattacks because the ledgeror record of transactionsexists in multiple copies.

I would like to commend President Vega-Serranoand the FATF more generallyfor addressing both the opportunities and the new issues raised by technology, including through your recent roundtables with the private sector.

It is important that regulatory frameworks remain adequate to the task. We have also just published a paper that provides a framework for assessing the impact of technological innovation within the financial sector. [1]

3. Maintaining correspondent banking relationships

The third and final policy priority is to support countries that are at risk of losing vital banking services that keep them connected to the global financial system.

These correspondent banking relationships are especially important for small countries with small financial systemsin Africa, the Caribbean, in Central Asia, and in the Pacific, to name a few. Recent surveys in our member countries underline the high degree of concern about the situation in these economies. [2]

To be clear, this issue has many dimensions, involving regulators, the financial industry, and the affected countries themselves.

The good news is that FATF has been working hard to ensure that the application of a robust AML/CFT framework does not lead to an indiscriminate withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships. I commend your decision to clarify the regulatory expectations under the FATF standard, including the customer due diligence requirements.

Greater regulatory certainty means that global banks are more likely to maintain their correspondent banking business. This, in turn, will help support economic and financial stability in the affected countries.

But the threat to growth and jobs means that more needs to be done by everybody. [3]

One of our contributions has been to bring together local banks, global banks, and other key stakeholders to discuss possible solutions.

For instance, a recent workshop in the Caribbean focused on improving the capacity of small banks to manage risks with the help of regional development banks, and how to enhance communication between the local and correspondent banks.

We will also continue to help our smaller member countries build capacity. For example, we have been working with Costa Rica, Peru, and Uruguay to create national AML/CFT strategies. And we recently helped Ukraine, Mongolia and Qatar strengthen the governance and capacity of their financial intelligence units.

Altogether, we have provided technical assistance on AML/CFT to 120 countries. And I am proud that our assistance was instrumental for countries such as Myanmar, Nepal, and Sudan to exit FATF monitoring and reconnect to the global financial system.

Conclusion

Let me conclude by saying that I would like us to continue our close cooperationbuilding on the progress made so far, for example, on the standard and assessment methodology.

As you know, we are very supportive of the risk-based approachand the emphasis on effectivenessunder the revised FATF standard. We look forward to the targeted follow-up assessments that will focus on countries main risks.

As a final thought, Winston Churchill often encouraged his staff to  level with events by which he meant that they should tell the unvarnished truthno sugar-coating of the facts.

Corruption, tax evasion, the financing of terrorism, and financial exclusion: these are big challenges for our member countries todayand they need to be addressed head-on.

By standing together as one, and by leveling with events, we will have the opportunity to promote financial integrity and inclusive growth for the benefit of all.

Thank you.

404,"South Africans have been baying for blood as evidence mounts that the countrys political leaders have been feathering their nests through a range of approaches  from state capture to corruption. Yet, equally appalling is the governments poor record at tackling the countrys crime rate. South Africans are so innured to murder, rape, robbery and other acts of extreme violence, it seems, that some see it as a positive sign that the murder rate in Cape Town has dropped from 63 out of every 100 000 Capetonians to 62 out of every 100 000. That decline, however, is miniscule, and to focus on that  and other similar trends  in the national crime figures released by police is to ignore an astonishing state of affairs: innocent citizens are being killed and maimed at a rate that makes the country look like a war zone. The reasons for the high crime rate are complex and include legacy apartheid issues. But in reality the ANC government has failed to put a concerted effort into radically overhauling the system so that justice is seen to be done  swiftly. The Oscar Pistorius trial reminded the world that beyond those postcard-perfect pictures of Table Mountain, safari parks and pristine seascapes, South Africa has a vicious underbelly  and for that there must be a price to pay in terms of keeping a lid on the tourism industry. For citizens, however, who live their daily lives literally dodging bullets and losing friends and family to crimes that go unpunished, the price must increasingly be a political one. The crime rate has surely played into the sharp fall-off in support for the ANC in the countrys metropolitan areas where survival cannot be possible without defences ranging from burglar bars to guns and other weapons.- Jackie Cameron

By Anine Kriegler

South Africa struggles with very high levels of crime and violence. Take the crime statistic on murder rates. The country ranks in the top 10 worst countries that report crime statistics according to the most recent data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Crime rate comparisons between countries are fraught with challenges and should be understood as broad indications rather than accurate quantitative relationships. Nevertheless, South Africa by any measure has a serious crime problem.

What insights can be gleaned from the latest annual crime statistics released by South Africas police?

What the numbers say

To draw meaningful conclusions about longer term trends it is necessary to use rates per 100,000 people in the population. For the last few years South Africas police force has opted to publicise only the raw figures for the number of crimes recorded. This doesnt account for population growth over time, or differences in population sizes between regions or towns.

The latest numbers had this to reveal about the five key crime types that are particularly worth watching.

Murder rate: this has risen nationally for the fourth year in a row, from 33 per 100,000 in 2014/2015 to 34 per 100,000 last year.

More concerning than the overall high number of murders, which is by no means a new development, is the fact that its rate of increase has accelerated. Whereas the rise from 2013/2014 to 2014/2015 was by 2.6%, the rise from 2014/2015 to 2015/2016 was by 3.1%. This suggests that the recent increase in fatal violence is not slowing and that South Africa may be in for several more years of increase. The country urgently needs to work out why these increases are happening.

Murder rate in Cape Town: after five bad years, this may finally have turned the corner. Cape Towns murder rate declined from 63 per 100,000 last year to 62 this year. This is a positive sign, but there is clearly a lot more work to be done. It is still at almost twice the national rate and among the highest in the world.

Aggravated robbery trends: The national rates of residential and non- residential robbery showed no decline although the rate at which they increased was smaller than it had been in years. Following the major increases between 2005/2006 and 2008/2009, it seems that relative stability in these crimes may have been reached. Turning them to a decline looks increasingly possible. The police should take heart.

Burglary: Recorded rates of burglary have continued their long and fairly steady decline and are now about a third lower than they were 15 years ago. This should be a comfort given how much this crime contributes to public fear. It does, however, appear that people may have become less inclined to report this crime to the police. The upcoming Victims of Crime Survey should be watched closely to see if this trend continues and to what extent it may be contributing to recorded rates of decline.

Drug-related crime and illegal possession of firearms: There has been a decrease in the recorded rates of drug-related crime for the first time in more than 20 years.

This could be the polices new back to basics plan in action. Acting head of police Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane has championed a renewed focus on policing fundamentals and areas of under-performance. This may have resulted in resources being directed away from seeking out drug-related crimes.

Depending on where you stand on the issue of the desirability or effectiveness of drug prohibition, this may or may not seem like a good thing.

The rates of illegal firearm possession have also decreased slightly in the last year.

It is important to remember that national statistics say very little about how individuals experience crime. Each neighbourhood is different, which requires individuals to do a deep dive into the crimes reported at local police stations.",nam
405,"By Mason Pan and Allanna Skeels

WASHINGTON--The concepts of fraud and return on investment (ROI) are rarely discussed in the same conversation; nevertheless there is significant merit in exploring the idea of using fraud detection as a proactive opportunity for business growth and a competitive advantage. As businesses face razor thin margins in an increasingly competitive global environment and fraudsters evolve in sophistication, the best offense is a good defense. For executives seeking to increase the competitiveness of their business, preventing fraud and its impacts in a cost efficient and effective way presents a major opportunity to grow the bottom line.

Fraud hits a company in three ways: it causes losses in business revenues (e.g., through illicit payments and disguised sales); it increases operating expenses (e.g., fraud detection and recovery); and as a result it has a serious impact on profitability. The good news is that companies can fight back at fraud by combining smart technology with analytics.

By investing in an intelligence-led, technology-driven data analytics solution, corporate fraud investigators and compliance officials can minimize the occurrence of fraud and recover funds more efficiently than ever. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), victim organizations that lacked anti-fraud controls suffered twice as much in median losses compared to organizations with anti-fraud programs such as proactive data monitoring/analysis systems, management reviews and fraud hotlines 1.

Increasing your bottom line

As fraud detection technology matures, and the return on investment from proactive fraud detection solutions increases, preventing fraud and recovering losses are fast becoming the most cost effective strategies to increasing a corporations bottom line. When comparing traditional performance improvement strategies to fraud prevention initiatives, organizations can achieve a greater ROI by implementing fraud detection programs.

For example, a financial institution recently implemented a proactive data analytics solution to monitor and prevent external fraud. The solution combines data aggregation, data analytics and data visualisation to streamline the effectiveness and efficiency of their in-house fraud investigation team. This intelligent solution enabled the team to move from reacting to preventing fraud with material financial recovery. The return on investment was over 1200%.

The true cost of fraud

The losses attributed to fraud often include only the direct costs such as fraud loss itself. Little consideration is given to the slew of negative impacts such as loss to employee morale and reputational damage that follow a fraud event. In an age when customer loyalty can change in the time it takes to read 140 characters, reputational damage can be fatal and non-recoverable. So, when these additional costs are factored into the total cost of fraud, the ROI of an effective fraud prevention program can be even greater. In fact, studies by Nevada University (2014) 2 and Friedrich-Alexander University (2015) 3 identified that companies facing fraud within their senior management team could see 30% erosion to their share price above and beyond the initial loss.

Operational challenges in fighting fraud

As long as there are rules and laws in business, opportunistic fraudsters will find a way to break them. The ACFE estimates that the typical organization loses 5% of annual revenues to fraud.

Besides revenue loss, companies incur operational costs (i.e., labor costs) by dedicating resources and assets to detect, remediate and recover from fraud. In large companies where fraud can be prevalent, fraud investigation units have evolved significantly, but not always at the same pace as the fraudsters themselves. For some global financial institutions, the current state fraud detection program is still the initial pilot program that they implemented years ago and has not been updated or enhanced to keep up with the growing sophistication of fraud.

In addition, human investigators are costly, inefficient and subjective. In large global corporations, critical information needed to detect and assess potential fraud is buried in a myriad of disparate systems that are inaccessible to these costly human investigators. They are forced to manually review and aggregate information needed to assess incidents of potential fraud, with each hour of their time snow balling into huge operational costs.

So how can organizations better combat fraud and achieve a high ROI?

The evolution of technology-driven fraud solutions, such as predictive analytics, may enable companies to rethink their position on the unavoidability of fraud losses. Advancements in technology continue to drive fraud detection costs down, while simultaneously increasing efficiency. Businesses can now generate strong ROI on fraud detection.

The latest evolution of anti-fraud solutions empowers the fraud investigator to drive operational efficiency and lower labor costs in the continuous fight to tackle fraud. These solutions enable the fraud investigator to do the following:

Better detect incidents of potential fraud by using more accurate rules to improve fraud detection precision and reduce the likelihood of false positives. This eliminates wasteful time investigating non-fraudulent incidents
Prioritize the focus of investigations by using a risk-based approach so fraud investigators can first review potentially fraudulent transactions that have the highest risk or nominal value. This optimizes the allocation and usage of resources
Improve decision making and assessment of fraud through an easy to view and centralized environment, as well as reducing manual tasks to gather, analyze and review information. This increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigators

Organizations can generate a much higher return on investment by implementing an anti-fraud solution that not only reduces time and costs, but makes better use of limited resources. Investing in a solution that helps to secure and protect an organizations assets in a way that demonstrates clear ROI will be welcomed by executives and financial officers.

Compliance officers can also help their business make smarter decisions by providing accurate information and actionable insights to combat fraud and protect their valuable assets. This cost effective fraud solution not only helps companies reduce their fraud loss and its associated risks, but also make informative business decisions and grow their bottom line.

In summary

Fraud is an inherent risk for organizations, but if compliance officers arm themselves with cost effective solutions such as data analytics to monitor, investigate and recover from fraud, their organizations can achieve a return on investment, better compete in the hyper competitive global market, and insulate their companies from market risks such as fraud. With many companies navigating the fine line between profit and loss, any effort to anticipate and remediate against such risks can prevent the scale of success from irreversibly tipping in the wrong direction.

The now-mom of two shockingly revealed to the cameras that while things ended with her former fiance and Bachelorette final pick, Roberto Martinez, she hooked up with another one of her contestants after the show: Frank Neuschaefer.

Fans will remember that Frank broke Ali's heart in Tahiti at final three, revealing that he still had feelings for his ex-girlfriend, Nicole. Though Bachelorette No. 6 ended her time with Frank in tears, they reunited a few years later.

""Honestly, I don't think I've ever told anybody this, but after Roberto and I broke up, I actually went on a date with Frank, and we were romantic for, like, a night!"" Ali said on Monday's special, laughing. Ali is now married to radio personality Kevin Manno; they share a 2-year-old daughter, Molly, and a 1-year-old son, Riley.

While speaking with ET last week, Bachelor host Chris Harrison said the Bachelorette reunion held a special place in his heart -- and that most of what went down between the ladies was completely unproduced.

""I really love these women, and I really liked that at the end of the day, we had all these Bachelorettes together for the first time, and we've never done anything like it,"" he shared.

""They were just sitting around and talking, telling stories of motherhood and just being women today and being Bachelorettes and going through this show and I just thought, 'This is great.' It's just celebrating these badass women doing their thing. And there was no producing, no nothing. It was just raw them,"" he revealed. ""And then having them lined up in the driveway later that night, like, looking from Trista to Becca like, 'Wow, we did this.' Like, all these kickass women doing their thing. I thought it was pretty cool.""

The Bachelorette officially kicks off Monday, May 13 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. Join ET's Bachelor Nation Facebook group here.

Data analysis can play a critical role in identifying indicators of fraud in most business process areas. By implementing risk and control data analytics to regularly monitor business transactions  and integrating them into an overall risk and control processmanagement can identify and respond quickly to red flags, and reduce the risk of fraud escalation.

In this whitepaper on Automating Fraud Detection, you will learn how to achieve results by applying data analysis software in key business areas through a discussion of typical frauds, detection processes and tests. Jump ahead to download this whitepaper here now.

Integrating Fraud Detection through Audit, Risk Management, and Compliance

One of the first issues to consider in implementing a fraud detection program is more of a strategic one: Ownership. Is the organizational objective to integrate fraud detection analytical testing processes into those of overall risk management and control, or is it instead to perform them within a standalone function? The specific technical use of data analysis will not vary much in either case, but the people and process aspects will usually require different considerations.

Data analysis, often in the form of continuous monitoring of transactions and controls, is increasingly used as a key component of risk management and audit processes overall. For many organizations it makes sense to integrate fraud detection objectives into risk management and audit processes, since the risk of fraud is simply one among many risks that an organization faces and should be considered within the full spectrum of risks.

408,"Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj (Arabic: ???? ??????? or ???? ??????; born 20 February 1960) is the head of the Presidential Council of Libya and prime minister [2] of the Government of National Accord of Libya, formed on 17 December 2015 under the Libyan Political Agreement. He has been a member of the Parliament of Tripoli. [3]

Tripoli. [4] He comes from a wealthy family of Kouloughli descent which owned shops and vast amount of land. [5] [6] Al-Sarraj himself is said to be of Turkish origin. [7] His father, Mostafa al-Sarraj was a minister during the Libyan Monarchy. [6] [8] Fayez al-Sarraj trained as an architect and during the Colonel Muammar Gaddafi era he was employed at the Housing Ministry. [9] In 2014, he served as the Minister of Housing and Utilities in the Maiteeq Cabinet of the GNC. [10] His opponents criticized his political appointment as a foreign imposition. [11] An article that appeared in 2016 in The Guardian newspaper quoted Guma el-Gamaty, a member of Libya Dialogue, the UN-chaired body that created the new government, saying that al-Sarraj was ""expected to ask for help to combat ISIS and train Libyan units."" [12]

Following Libya's 2014 elections, the government became split between the New General National Congress in Tripoli and the internationally recognized legislature of the House of Representatives in Tobruk. [3]

Presidency[ edit ]

In early October 2015 the United Nations envoy to Libya, Bernardino León, proposed a National Unity Government for Libya, to be led by the Presidential Council of Fayez al-Sarraj, as prime minister, three deputies from the country's eastern, western, and southern regions, and two ministers. [13] However, this national unity government was rejected by the internationally recognized legislature in Tobruk and the rival government in Tripoli. [14]

Fayez al-Sarraj, and six members of the Presidential Council and proposed cabinet arrived in Tripoli on 30 March 2016. [15] The following day, it was reported [ undue weight?  discuss ] that the GNA had taken control of the prime ministerial offices and that the GNC appointed prime minister Khalifa al-Ghawil had fled to Misrata. [16] [ unreliable source? ]

On 14 October 2016, forces loyal to GNC took over the building of the High Council of State and announced the comeback of Ghawil cabinet [17] [18] Then, fighting occurred between Sarraj loyalists and Ghawil forces. [19] [20]

On 16 September, al-Sarraj stated that he will be stepping down from his position by the end of October 2020. This has come after one month of protests in Tripoli. [21] [22]

On 31 October 2020, al-Sarraj rescinded his decision to resign. [23]

Government of National Accord[ edit ]

Sarraj with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 16 May 2016

Sarraj has been Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord since its installment in December 2015 as part of a United Nations -led political agreement.

Prior to his initial arrival in Tripoli in March 2016, Sarraj survived two separate assassination attempts. [24]

Over the past two years, the GNA has struggled to gain a foothold as a legitimate institution of authority inside the country, and Libya has remained divided. [25] The government's initial proposed group of ministers was rejected by the House of Representatives (HoR), leading Sarraj to form a government that received a no confidence vote from the HoR. [26] Infighting among rival militias has only intensified, and Libyan citizens have faced economic hardships, including inflation, corruption, and smuggling, that are ""melting away the country's cash reserves"". [27] [28]

The United Nations representatives who initially formed the unity government have since expressed concern over its ability to make progress. In December 2016, the Security Council noted the ""limited authority"" of the GNA and stated that ""the Libyan Political Agreement did not fulfill the expectations. The implementation has stalled."" [29]

Months following this statement, an April 2017 U.N. Security Council meeting summary cautioned that ""Libya could relapse into conflict"" and said the government has struggled to ""deliver basic services while endeavoring to fight terrorism, illegal migration and oil smuggling."" [30]

In an attempt to make the government more effective, reports have surfaced throughout 2017 of a consensus to restructure the GNA and overall Libyan Political Agreement. [31] [32]

In July 2018, Libya rejected European Union 's plan aimed at stopping migration from Libya. [33]

On 10 April 2019, United Nations chief António Guterres said, at the UN headquarters, that he still hopes to avoid a ""bloody battle for Tripoli"". Two days before that, troops loyal to Khalifa Haftar began moving toward the capital. [34]

409,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Thousands of Alabamians took advantage of absentee voting in the 2020 Presidential Election leading many to wonder why the state doesnt offer early voting.

Thats a decision for Alabama lawmakers, and one state representative is already working on it.

Early voting in Alabama is an issue Rep. John Rogers is pushing for right now.

Im pre-filing a bill Im trying to work both sides of the aisle. Im trying to work with Republicans and Democrats so we can get a chance to vote early, Rogers said.

So far, Ive got all the Democrats. I just got to get a few Republicans to concur, he explained.

Thousands of voters waited hours in long lines to cast their ballots on Election Day.

And while many took advantage of absentee voting, Rogers said the state needs more ways to accommodate voters.

Its a constitutional right to have the right to vote and we should make it easier. By early voting you make it easier for folks to get to the polls and vote, Rogers said.

His republican colleague, Rep. Danny Garrett agrees.

I think you could have a process that works that allows people an opportunity to vote and we certainly want people to vote. We want them to exercise that right, and I think we should accommodate them just like we do accommodate people in other areas of life, Garrett said.

He added that we may not have to wait as long for results with early voting.

Texas for example, was called fairly early last night and Texas had a large, I want to say it was maybe 70% was early vote. So, they already had that tabulated, so they just added the election day votes and were able to call that pretty quickly, Garrett explained.

Both representatives said early voting may also encourage more people to get out and vote.

Rep. Garrett said about 62% of Alabama voters turned out for the November 3 election compared to the 15% to 20% at most other elections.",nam
410,"Mumbai: With an aim to beef up its capabilities to detect frauds and bring scamsters to book, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is putting in place new software tools to help in its investigations and surveillance activities.

The new tools would help the capital markets watchdog in keeping a close watch on possible manipulative activities in the stock markets by monitoring suspicious trades as also by analysing the information available in the public domain such as on social media and other Internet platforms.

According to a senior official, Sebi has identified enhancement of its market surveillance capabilities as a core focus area for the current financial year.

Capacity building for effective integrated surveillance particularly of derivatives market is essential so as to align with the ever-changing market dynamics.

During the year, special focus will be laid on enhancement of skill sets for using analytical and statistical tools to facilitate effective surveillance,"" he added.

In the budget estimates for the current fiscal 2014-15, Sebi has already accounted for the necessary expenses towards software for investigation work and Fraud Intelligence Software, sources said, while adding that this project was currently under implementation.

Sebi has already carried out upgradation of its Integrated Market Surveillance System (IMSS), through which it undertakes its market surveillance functions and collects data for suspicious market activities through multiple sources, including its network systems at stock exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions.

Sebi also intends to further beef up in due course its Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence System (DWBIS), which is used for speedy analysis of data and identification of possible violations like insider trading, sources said. For the time being, an intermediate upgradation is being carried out of the DWIBS tool, while an open-tender process may be adopted in some time for further works in this regard.

Sebi already has got a sophisticated surveillance system, which generates at least 100 alerts of suspicious trading activities every day. After following up on all these alerts on various automated parameters, an estimated 8-10 alerts are taken for next-level analysis and therefore investigation and enforcement actions are carried out for necessary cases.

The surveillance systems also track media reports for information being shared among the investors and those are put under scanner that appear suspicious and in violation to the Sebi regulations and model codes of conduct for various entities, including listed companies and market intermediaries.

Sebi has also set up a Forensic Accounting Cell to tackle corporate frauds by listed firms and market entities. The cell also works towards improving the quality of financial information disclosed by the companies, besides assisting in detection of financial irregularities.

To enhance the quality of financial reporting done by listed entities, Sebi has set up a Qualified Audit Report Review (QARC) on which auditing regulator ICAI, stock exchanges and other stakeholders are also represented.

With an aim to strengthen its surveillance functions to detect fraudulent and manipulative activities, Sebi is also planning to study market intelligence infrastructure and techniques of regulators in the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong.

The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others.

The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by Sebi for the current fiscal. The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc.

With regard to Sebis capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously.

At present, Sebis average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip.

While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation.

412,"The leader of a monastery calmly juggles the ambitions of those around him in King Hu's wuxia drama.

Another in a string of restorations that in recent years have benefitted fans of wuxia legend King Hu, Raining in the Mountain is one of two pictures the late Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based auteur (most famous for Come Drink with Me and the Cannes favorite A Touch of Zen) made in South Korea. Considerably shorter and more direct than the other Korean project (Legend of the Mountain, which got its first U.S. run in 2018), this 1979 film focuses on mortal ambition and corruption instead of witchcraft, and again, is not for viewers who expect a high ratio of action to dialogue. But patient viewers will find much to enjoy in this parable-like story, which is billed as a heist film but is ultimately less concerned with thievery than with moral justice.

The remote Three Treasures Temple, overseen by a nonagenarian abbot (Chin Chang-Ken), is serene at first glance: set high up a mist-shrouded, forested mountain and populated by monks who spend their days in prayer and contemplation. But it's actually both a place simmering with internal conflict  among the young monks hoping the soon-to-retire abbot will choose them as his successor  and targeted by outsiders: One of the treasures that gives the place its name, a scroll containing the Mahayana Sutra, is a priceless relic that is not very well guarded.

Sadly, some of the abbot's most trusted advisers have designs on that scroll. As he prepares to choose which monk will replace him, the abbot seeks advice from his old friend Esquire Wen (Sun Yueh); a general named Wang (Tien Fung); and a lay Buddhist scholar (Wu Chia-Hsiang) who, though he travels with a coterie of young women, is said to be so spiritually oriented he's ""immune to sensual pleasures.""

Some if not all of the above have hidden agendas, but we know Wen's from the start: He travels with a servant and a concubine (Ming-Tsai Wu and frequent Hu collaborator Feng Hsu) who are actually cat burglars tasked with stealing the scroll for him. Much of the film's first half hour watches as the two sneak, hide and leap over walls while casing the temple's grounds, interrupted only by scenes introducing other characters and explaining how each fits into local politics.

We're nearly an hour into the picture before seeing anything that could be called action, when a constable named Chang Cheng (Chen Hui-Lou) catches the thieves with a box of pilfered prayer beads. The ensuing game of keep-away plays almost more like choreographed comedy than a fight scene, though, and looks even sillier in comparison to the violence-free but highly charged confrontation that comes next  when the lieutenant bumps into a man he once had imprisoned on false charges.

That convict, Chiu Ming (Tung Lin), purchased the right to become a monk instead of serving his sentence; the movie quickly establishes him as its embodiment of humility and virtue, happy to serve the abbot in any lowly capacity. As with that famous piece of calligraphy, which the abbot often dismisses as a ""tattered old scroll,"" exceptional inner worth often comes in an unimpressive physical package.

Raining will eventually stage some colorful chase sequences through beautifully photographed woods, and Henry Chan's painterly widescreen compositions are well served by this restoration. But the richest thing the film offers lies within the temple's walls: As he did in The Fate of Lee Khan, which was set mostly inside a roadside inn, Hu brings a small space to life as a network of invisible schemes, alliances and ambition. Three or four important monks join the aforementioned characters in pursuit of either the abbot's spiritual blessing or his material possessions; most of them are using someone else as a tool, and few understand they're not the only ones who know how to smile while lying. It's hardly a spoiler to say that the abbot, who talks little and sees much, is not the easiest person to deceive.

413,"Re-launched US visa plan lowers cash threshold for potential China migrants

As options to the lackluster stock market or the strictly contained property se cto r, China's expanding middle class is looking to other sources of investment in the hope of getting a profitable return, not just financially but psychologically.

While it may seem odd to encourage investing abroad in a Chinese newspaper headline, an American immigration plan has been re-launched with a lower threshold for would-be immigrant investors who want to improve on an already decent life in China.

The EB-5, a US Immigrant Investor program that offers temporary visas to foreign investors with the possibility of becoming permanent residents, has really taken off in the past three years because of a major change in the rules.

Paradoxically, the revelation of an investment fraud under the policy in January has garnered the program more attention, accompanied, naturally, by growing concerns.

The EB-5 requires foreign investors to pour $1 million into creating projects and jobs in targeted employment areas in the United States. Data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services suggest that 41 percent of all visa recipients in 2011 were Chinese nationals.

An eligible candidate can be anyone who put his or her lawfully gained a sse ts into an investment. However, a permanent green car d is only granted if it leads to the creation of 10 or more full-time jobs.

The program did not take off after regional centers were set up 10 years ago, said Laura Reiff, co-chair of business immigration and compliance practice at Miami-headquartered law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP.

""The program was announced in the early 1990s when the (US) Congress passed the law to attract investors to compete with big migration nations such as Australia and Canada. But not many people want to invest $1 million without knowing for sure they can create jobs,"" she said.

In 2003, an amendment was passed to the law to set up regional centers that allowed individual investors to put their money together to create bigger and more feasible projects.

A regional center is not merely a defined geographic area but rather is a legally established entity that coo rdinates foreign investment within that area in compliance with the EB-5 statutory, regulatory and precedent decision framework.

Reiff said regional centers are designated by the federal government in terms of geographic areas, allowing them to manage and market projects such as hotels manufacturing facilities, nursing houses and so on. These ""quasi-government"" agencies interact with the US government and investors on behalf of the projects, but most of them are privately run.

The reform gained added momentum when the benchmark investment amount was cut in half to $500,000, on the premise that the investment is made either in rural areas or in districts with high unemployment rates (considered to be 150 percent of the national average or more).",nam
414,"Vladimir Voronkov, Head of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said the global coronavirus crisis underscored the challenges involved in eliminating terrorism, as he presented the UN Security Council with the latest report on ISILs impact on international peace and security.

This pandemic environment raises several strategic and practical challenges for counter-terrorism, which we discussed during the Virtual Counter-Terrorism Week organized by my Office last month, he told Council members during video-teleconference briefing.

 #ISIL & other terrorist groups seek to exploit the far-reaching disruption & negative socio-economic & political impacts of the pandemic. Strengthening collective action & intl #counterterrorism cooperation must remain a priority during & after the pandemic, USG Voronkov https://t.co/mTI3Fl82Kf pic.twitter.com/sJ0qjPdfZw

 United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (@UN_OCT) August 24, 2020

Since the start of this year, the threat has grown in conflict zones, as seen by the regrouping and increased activity of ISIL and some of its affiliates in Iraq and Syria, he explained.

ISIL expands opportunistic propaganda efforts amid pandemic

In non-conflict areas, the threat seems to have decreased in the short term, with COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions apparently lowering the risk of attacks.

However, opportunistic propaganda efforts by ISIL could be fuelling an ongoing trend of attacks by individuals and small groups, he said.

Unclear, he added, is how the pandemic is affecting ISILs recruitment and fundraising efforts, or whether there is a change in strategic direction under its new leader, Amir Muhammad Said Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla. His predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed during a US military operation in Syria in 2019.

Putting a spotlight on regional developments, Mr. Voronkov said that ISIL continues to consolidate its position in some parts of the Middle East previously under its control, operating increasingly confidently and openly.

More than 10,000 ISIL fighters are estimated to be active in Iraq and Syria, moving freely in small cells between the two countries, he said, adding that 2020 has seen a significant increase in ISIL attacks in both States compared to 2019.

COVID-19 and suspected terrorists

The COVID-19 crisis has further complicated the already dire and unsustainable situation of several thousand people  especially women and children  with suspected links to ISIL. Some countries are still repatriating children, but there has been only limited progress on overcoming legal, political and practical hurdles to repatriation, he said.

The global threat from ISIL is likely to increase if the international community fails to meet this challenge, Mr. Voronkov warned, calling for decisive action from Member States on humanitarian, human rights and security grounds.

Turning to Africa, he described Islamic State in West Africa Province and its 3,500 members as a major focus of ISIL global propaganda as it reinforces its links with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara  the most dangerous group in the tri-border area of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.

While ISIL has only a few hundred fighters in Libya, it is exploiting tensions between ethnic groups and represents a portent threat capable of broader regional impact, he said, adding that ISIL could potentially expand its activities if the conflict in the North Africa nation escalates.

In Europe, the main threat comes from Internet-driven homegrown terrorist radicalization, he said. Acute concerns surround the release of prisoners with terrorist background and connections, while the rise of right-wing violent extremism means that intelligence services in some European countries are shifting their priorities away from ISIL.

Looking towards Asia, he said that ISILs affiliate in Afghanistan, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, remains capable of high-profile attacks - despite territorial losses and the arrest of its leaders - as it seeks to use the country to spread its influence across the region and to attract fighters who oppose the peace agreement between the Taliban and the United States.",nam
415,"At a time when its almost impossible to earn much interest on bonds, and equities seem too risky, some retirement savers are investing their individual retirement account in nontraditional investments. But beware of schemes that threaten your retirement, particularly self-directed IRAs.

The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) reports that scam artists pitching self-directed IRAs is now among the top 10 threats facing investors today.

To be sure, self-directed IRAs can be a safe way to invest retirement funds, NASAA said in release. But investors should be mindful of potential fraudulent schemes when considering a self-directed IRA.

By way of background, a self-directed IRA is an IRA held by a trustee or custodian that permits investment in a broader set of assets than is permitted by most IRA custodians, according to the SEC. Most IRA custodians are banks and broker-dealers that limit holdings in IRA accounts to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs. Custodians and trustees for self-directed IRAs, however, may allow investors to invest retirement funds in other types of assets such as real estate, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities. Read Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud.

These sorts of investments are not inherently bad, but NASAA, SEC and others warn that such investments have unique risks, such as lack of disclosure and liquidity, that must be considered.

Whats more, NASAA is warning investors fraud promoters pushing a Ponzi scheme or other investment fraud can misrepresent the responsibilities of self-directed IRA custodians in order to deceive investors into believing that their investments are legitimate or protected against losses.

For the record, custodians and trustees of self-directed IRAs may have limited duties to investors, and generally will not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of an investment or its promoters, NASAA said in its release.

While a scam artist may suggest that self-directed IRA custodians analyze and validate investments, those custodians only hold the assets in a self-directed IRA and generally do not evaluate the quality, value or legitimacy of any investment, NASAA said.

In some cases, NASAA said fraud promoters convince investors to move assets from an existing self-directed or traditional IRA into a fake self-directed IRA held by a supposed custodian created and owned by the scam artist.

And, fraudsters also exploit the tax-deferred characteristics of self-directed IRAs, and know that the financial penalty for early withdrawal may cause investors to be more passive or to keep funds in a fraudulent scheme longer than those who invest through other means, NASAA said.

Meanwhile, IRA experts say there is plenty that investors who want to use self-directed IRAs can do to avoid dealing with scam artists.

What are your goals?

The first item on your punch list when thinking about self-directed IRA is this: Does the investment fit in with your overall plan? Be sure your IRA investment is consistent with your investment goals, risk tolerances and experiences, said James Jones, founder and CEO of the Self-Directed IRA Investment Institute and vice president of business development for Kingdom Trust Co.

Jeremy Rettick, an investment adviser representative of BCM and the chief marketing officer of Covenant Reliance Producers, says its essential that the investment fits in with your risk profile. As the old saying goes, Dont put all your eggs in one basket, said Rettick. If you decide that a self-directed IRA is the right option for you consider only placing a portion of you total retirement dollars within the plan. As always consider how much risk you are taking on and if it is in line with your overall risk tolerance.

Invest your time before investing your money

Next, you have to invest your time vetting everything and anything having to do with your self-directed IRAthe investment, the adviser and the custodianbefore you invest your money.

Consider first what Rettick calls the Warren Rule.

As Warren Buffett said, Never invest in a business you cant understand, said Rettick. This philosophy has worked well for Mr. Buffet and could pay dividends to the investor. There are many nontypical investments available within self-directed IRAs. Bottom line he investor needs to understand what they are investing in.

Jones holds that same point of view. The most important advice I give daily for investors of self-directed IRAs is: You should know your alternative asset class and more specifically the actual investment better than your financial planner knows stocks, bonds and mutual funds.

Whether it is real estate, private equity or debt, crowdfunding, precious metals and the like, Jones said you should already be investing in these categories with good knowledge, experience, networks and advisers.

And Rob Spalding, the founder and senior adviser with Alternative Solutions Group, noted the following: Investors should always be vigilant about any investment they make, whether with mutual fund fees or due diligence on a private investment offer involving a self-directed IRA. Ultimately, investors need to be mindful of the investments they make inside or outside of self-directed IRAs.

Rettick said investors also need to be mindful of the following:

Liquidity: Find out how liquid the investments are. Do you have to keep money invested for a certain period to avoid any early withdraw penalty?

Investment values: Ask how the value of your investments will be calculated on your statements. Custodians may list the value as reported to them by the promoter but the price may not accurately reflect the price at which the investment could be sold.

Guaranteed returns: Is the investment FDIC-insured? If not, what is guaranteed and how is it guaranteed?

Fees/commissions: They must share commissions, fees and loads that may apply. Make sure you know what you are paying and if the amount is competitive.

Tax consequences: Talk to an accountant to understand fully the limitations within the plan. The IRS has numerous prohibited transactions that could disqualify the IRAs tax deferred status forcing you to pay income taxes on the full value of the IRA.

Jones also recommends asking a trusted professional, such as your accountant, lawyer or ?nancial adviser, for a second opinion about the proposed self-directed IRA investment by having them review of the investment offering or subscription agreement.

Know your custodian

Besides knowing your investment, its imperative that you get to know your custodian and the people behind the investment. Remember, you are now the investor and adviser, said Jones. Due your own extensive due diligence to start, not only the investment offering, but the company and its officers even though you likely know them. You should only invest in asset classes you know, with people that you know. You should never invest with strangers.

Rettick also recommends you make sure your funds will be held by a credible independent trustee/custodian. Typically you can talk to your bank, credit union or a well-known custodian, he said. If the promoter holds the funds directly that is a huge red flag.

The trustee/custodian isn't required to conduct due diligence with respect to the quality or suitability of the investment, but they should have in place fraud detection measures. Ask your IRA custodian what fraud detection measures they have in place, such as checking the companys good standing with regulators and authorities in the state they do business, said Jones.

Whats more, Jones noted that neither your IRA custodian nor any governmental agency endorses or guarantees non-FDIC insured investments. While an IRA custodian can educate investors on alternative asset classes, they can never advise, direct or steer them to an investment, said Jones. If an investment sponsor is promoting self-directed IRAs, check with that IRA custodian to see if they in fact have a relationship.

Additional resources for investors who want to vet their custodians for self-directed IRAs can be found at the Retirement Industry Trust Association (RITA). RITA, according to Spalding, is a trade association for custodians that aims to enhance industry best practices and fight investor fraud.

Work with experienced professionals

The self-directed IRA business has been around for a while, but its growing rapidly and there are plenty of newcomers to the business. Thats why Spalding recommends that you work only licensed and regulated advisers.

Beyond healthy skepticism, self-investigation and asking the investment sponsor for substantial due diligence items, investors should consider working with a licensed financial advisers, especially registered investment advisers or RIAs, who have experience with financial due diligence and alternative investments, Spalding said. RIAs are generally regulated by the SEC or their state securities division.

Few would argue with the need to vet advisers pitching self-directed IRAs. They should be properly licensed to sell securities in their state, said Rettick.

At a minimum, the SEC suggests that you make sure your brokers, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives have not had disciplinary problems or been in trouble with regulators or other investors before you invest or pay for any investment advice. Read Protect Your Money: Check Out Brokers and Investment Advisers. Other resources include the SEC, NASAA, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Watch for red flags

Jones also suggests looking out for fraud red ?ags including but not limited to an unknown solicitation coming to you, guaranteed investment returns, high pressure sales techniques, short investment decision time lines requiring immediate action to complete the transaction, and too-good-to-be-true statements. Scam artists know investors decide too often on emotional decisions and not careful analysis, said Jones. Be prepared to walk away from every deal, and trust your gut.

Additionally, with the pending Federal JOBS Act legislation and the formalization of real equity-based crowdfunding, Spalding said the need for investors to be watchful of their investments is only going to intensify.

After you invest

After youve opened a self-directed IRA, Jones recommends that you carefully review each account statement and follow up with questions to the investment sponsor if you do not understand it or something doesn't make sense or seems suspicious. Review these statements with your advisers and never alone, he said.

Remember too that the IRA custodian maintains your account and forwards account information to you but it is not responsible for any pro?ts or losses on your investments, said Jones.

And, if ever you suspect some suspicious activity related to the investments in your self-directed IRA, Jones says you should report it to your IRA custodian as well as state and federal authorities.

416,"BEIJING  The next phase of Chinese President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption crackdown will see almost five times as many officials in Beijing under the state's watchful eye, officials said Tuesday.

In the past five years, Xis sweeping drive has punished more than 1.5 million corrupt Communist Party officials, including former political rivals and senior military leaders. Observers say such measures have boosted Xi's popularity among ordinary people.

For the first time, authorities gave foreign journalists access to the once-secretive apparatus behind the anti-graft campaign which has helped Xi consolidate his rule. He is now seeking a controversial measure that eliminates term limits and will potentially allow him to remain in power indefinitely.

Beijing has been chosen together with two other provinces to pilot the crackdown's expansion beyond the ruling Communist Party to government officials and people working for state-owned enterprises as well as those providing education, health and other services.

The new measure will leave almost a million officials in China's capital city facing monitoring and regular disciplinary check-ups, a huge increase from the 210,000 previously impacted. Beijing is home to around 21 million people.

This will ensure that supervision covers everyone working in the public sector who exercises public power, said Zhang Shuofu, director-general of the newly established Beijing Municipal Supervision Commission.

Both the Communist Partys disciplinary body and the city governments watchdog agency will work together in a multi-story office building.

More than 770 officials have been transferred from other departments to bolster this new apparatus.

""Abuse of power, dereliction of duty ... malpractice for personal gains, and waste of state assets,"" will all be targeted, according to Zhang.

Whistleblowers will be welcomed at a reception hall that can sit 30 people.

418,"Iraqs new Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office after the countrys parliament approved a new government on Wednesday following nearly six months of political wrangling.

The parliament approved 15 ministers out of a prospective 22-seat cabinet in a vote of confidence. Five candidates were rejected while voting on two ministers was postponed, leaving seven ministries still empty, including the key oil and foreign affairs positions.

Two previous nominees for the role of prime minister  Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi and Adnan al-Zurfi  failed to secure enough support among cabinet ministers.

This led to President Barham Salih appointing al-Kadhimi as prime minister-designate last month as the third candidate to form a cabinet, amidst a backdrop of anti-government protests.

The protests began in October 2019 after thousands of Iraqis took to the streets and called for the overhaul of what they said was the countrys political and corrupt ruling elite.

Heavy-handed responses by the government security forces, which killed hundreds of protesters, forced then Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to resign, although he remained in a caretaker role until Allawi was appointed in early February.

Before the voting session on the new cabinet on Wednesday, al-Kadhimi said his government would be a solution-based, not a crisis government. He promised early elections and rejected the use of Iraq as a battleground by other countries.

The prime minister also pledged to address the repercussions of the economic crisis by rationalising spending and negotiating to restore Iraqs share of oil exports.

Early life

Born Mustafa Abdellatif Mshatat in 1967 in the capital Baghdad, he left Iraq in 1985 to Iran, before moving to Germany and the United Kingdom, which he later became a citizen of.

He holds a bachelors degree in law and is better known for his work as a journalist, where he chose the title of al-Kadhimi.

He was known to oppose the rule of the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, al-Kadhimi returned to Iraq and cofounded the Iraqi Media Network, running in parallel with his work as executive director of the Iraq Memory Foundation, an organisation founded for the purpose of documenting the crimes under Husseins Baath regime.

Al-Kadhimi also served as editor-in-chief of Iraqs Newsweek magazine for three years from 2010. He is also an opinions writer as well as the editor of the Iraq section of the US-based Al-Monitor website.

In June 2016, al-Khadhimi took over the role of director of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, in light of the intensification of the battles against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).

During his tenure, he forged links with dozens of countries and agencies operating within the US-led international coalition against ISIL.

During a rare visit to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, accompanied by former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, al-Kadhimi was seen in a long embrace with his friend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).

Al-Kadhimi is widely viewed by associates and politicians as having a pragmatic mentality in addition to cultivating relations with all the main players across the Iraqi political spectrum: a good relationship with the US, and another that has recently reached out to the Iranians.

Iran and its allied Iraqi Fatah political bloc had previously vetoed al-Kadhimis appointment.

Last month, Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed group close to Iran and linked to the Popular Mobilization Units, issued a statement accusing al-Kadhimi of having blood on his hands for the deaths of its leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, and accused him of collaborating with the US.

However, with the oil price crash and the coronavirus pandemic, compromises were made between the Fatah bloc and al-Kadhimi who said he will uphold the muhasasa, or political apportionment system.

Introduced in Iraq after the 2003 US-led invasion in an attempt to provide proportional government representation among Iraqs various ethno-sectarian groups, many Iraqis believe the system is deeply flawed and acts as a conduit for corruption and political patronage.

According to Iraqi political analyst Hisham al-Hashimi, al-Kadhimi faces no easy task in getting the country back on its feet again.

I dont doubt his ability on the technical issues such as forming equitable laws and a fair commission, al-Hashimi told Al Jazeera.

He will succeed in preparing for early elections, but the timing is not on his side due to the dire economic conditions and the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.",nam
419,"The global impact of money laundering is staggering; with related transactions estimated at 2 to 5% of global GDP  amounting to up to $2 trillion. The IMF defines money laundering as a process of conducting financial transactions in a manner that obscures the link between funds and their origin. However, money laundering is more than just a financial crime  performed by criminals and terrorists to finance their illegal activities, it not only hampers the global economy but also poses a threat to security.

Even though anti-money laundering (AML) solutions and regulations are in place across the world, less than 1% of illicit financial flows are currently seized by authorities due to the complex nature of the activity. Global spend on AML compliance is expected to cross $8 billion by 2017, but countries as well as financial institutions are unable to enforce these policies effectively enough to plug the holes in their systems.

Its clear that traditional AML solutions are unable to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of financial transactions that need to be monitored for laundering activities. Meanwhile, money launderers are constantly discovering more innovative ways to conduct illicit financial transactions, while the institutions attempt to catch up with these increasingly sophisticated criminals. The need of the hour is an innovative technology which can combat money laundering in a scalable, cost-effective and comprehensive manner.

Challenges of Existing AML Solutions

Aging AML solutions are inadequate to meet todays business challenges and are unprepared for tomorrows needs. The existing transaction monitoring systems, based on traditional technology, are unable to keep pace with the growing wave of new digital financial services, including cryptocurrencies. Criminals have begun leveraging these emerging channels for their money laundering activities, making it even harder for authorities to trace them.

Unlike traditional financial transactions that require financial institutions as intermediaries, crypto and other digital routes are faster, encrypted for greater security, often anonymous and in most parts of the world, remain unregulated by governments till date. Existing AML solutions are not equipped to investigate these highly encrypted and P2P forms of financial transactions yet.

Secondly, most AML efforts that are currently implemented are highly individualistic in nature, with each financial institution deploying its own solution and every country having its own laws to prevent money laundering. There is also not enough standardization and the lack of collaboration makes money laundering more challenging to detect and act against.

Rising globalization has caused an exponential increase in cross-border financial transactions. The volume and complexity of financial transactions have increased manifold. Without automation, end-to-end analytics and limited visualization capabilities, traditional transaction monitoring tools and solutions are being rendered ineffective.

Blockchain for AML Transaction Monitoring

Blockchain is essentially a cryptographic ledger comprising of a digital log of transactions which can be shared across a public or private network. The technology, by its very nature, lends itself to integrated decentralized monitoring efforts of financial transactions.

An anti-money laundering system built on the blockchain can leverage the cryptographically secure, decentralized and immutable nature of the technology to identify and stop suspicious transactions effectively. A distributed blockchain-based system using smart-contracts with inbuilt algorithms, will allow financial institutions to securely parse data through an AML engine on the blockchain; with the automation providing high efficiency and ensuring minimum friction.

Each financial institution which would be part of this system would serve as a node within the private permissioned blockchain network, and would use the network directory and smart contracts to record transactions on the blockchain.

Since relevant information would be stored in the blockchain and be made available to each node, suspicious activity can be detected and highlighted to all related participants. Alerts can then be issued to stakeholders and the transaction can automatically be flagged and stopped for further investigation. The blockchain network is immediately updated with the record of such an alert in an immutable and tamper-proof manner.

A blockchain-based AML platform makes it possible for regulatory authorities, risk officers, auditors and other relevant stakeholders to monitor complex transactions in an automated and effective manner, as well as immutably record audit trails of suspicious transactions across the system.

The design of the blockchain can ensure compliance with data sovereignty laws while complementing existing legacy AML solutions, enhancing their effectiveness by adding an additional layer of scrutiny and visibility. The overall platform based on blockchain can be used by participating financial institutions to instantly alert each other about any potentially fraudulent transactions and flag them for further investigation.

Getting started  harnessing the potential of Blockchain for AML transaction monitoring

Any risk executive looking to harness the potential of blockchain for AML within a financial institution, auditory or regulatory authority should consider the following methodology to get started:

Understand application of Blockchain for AML and secure executive sponsorship  Before embarking on a blockchain project, it is imperative to get a good understanding of distributed ledger technology and how it can be leveraged for AML transaction monitoring.

Form a working group, validate hypothesis and design a PoC engagement to get started with  Identify a core team with representation from across stakeholder groups to collaboratively work on the initiative. Engage external experts to form a well-rounded and well-informed team.
On-board participants and kick-off the project  Set up a lab-like environment. Start small. Begin with a few select cases/red flag triggers that can be showcased to a wider audience to highlight benefits and prime adoption.

Develop the prototype for select use cases  Use the experimental environment and a technical team to set up the blockchain network, develop the application and deploy the smart contracts

Evaluate the prototype(s) and pick the ones most promising for mainstream deployment  Once the prototype(s) are developed, tested rigorously by the team and validated by the stakeholders, select winners that can be adopted and piloted on an enterprise-wide level.

Considerations for Mainstream Deployment of Blockchain-based AML Solution

The technology is still in its early days and use cases exploring the potential of blockchain are isolated and limited. However, to truly realize their potential, implementations of blockchain based solutions for AML need to be integrated into the core IT landscape within each participating institution.

If deployed within a bank to connect its various globally dispersed branches, the decentralized system will complement existing legacy AML applications and add an extra ring of scrutiny and visibility.

Leveraging a blockchain platform for AML nationwide or across a geographical region will give regulators, auditors and other stakeholders an effective and powerful set of tools to monitor complex transactions and immutably record the audit trail of suspicious transactions across the system. However, this will need cross-industry participation and require buy-in from leaders across regulatory authorities as well as the participating banks and other financial institutions.

Either way, its only a matter of time before financial institutions and regulators adopt distributed ledger technology to connect, gain visibility and collaboratively prevent money laundering.",nam

421,"We are all getting back to the basics.

While it might feel good to bake bread, the best way to get through the coronavirus pandemic could be to stock your emergency fund and learn to do-it-yourself with household chores so you can save on expenses.

One bright spot: You might have more time on your hands.

Think optimistically. You can learn to DIY, sock away cash and set a disaster budget for tough times.

If youve been putting off thinking about money, nows the time to dedicate those extra hours in the week  no more commuting, no more rushed work mornings  to shoring up your finances.

Hold off on panicking by looking ahead, says Sasha Hutchison, 38, an accounting manager and personal finance blogger in Austin, Texas.

Take a look at your net worth: what you owe, what you can do to bring in cash now. It helps you to feel more in control, Hutchison said.

When Hutchison says to look at everything, she means everything. A health savings account or a flexible spending account through your job can help pay for health care. How much cash do you have on hand? Whats in your portfolio, even if its shrinking? It might be a difficult time to collect from anyone who owes you money  but still good to know that its out there.

Cash-back credit cards can be another source. Groceries and gas help accumulate points quickly. (Hutchison pays off the balance each month.)

An emergency fund is more critical than ever. In one week in March, things changed almost daily, says Liz Gendreau, 39, who blogs about family finance on her website, Chief Mom Officer.

You might get reduced hours, a pay cut, said Gendreau, who lives in Hartford County, Connecticut. Before that happens, ideally, is the time to take a really close look at your budget.

Youll never regret having emergency savings  only not saving while you had the chance.

When things go back to the way they were, you can use that pile of cash to pay off debt or for something you wanted to do.

A budget for slim times

Got a budget? Thats great. Now might be a very good time to create and use the emergency version.

According to Heather Albrecht, 37, a financial coach in Hartford, Vermont, its best to make this plan before you need it. Its so much easier when you dont look for things to cut under duress. Write it down, so you can pull it out and see the plan youve made.

What small luxuries do you want to keep? What you can live without? The more you cut, the longer you can make savings last.

Be ruthless, Albrecht said. You can always add in things if you feel you cant live without them.

424,"Action against corporates by financial regulators demonstrating they are widening their focus and bringing corporates into the world of financial crime compliance is well documented. Non-compliance can attract heavy fines and the risk of reputational damage which would be considered reckless, at best.

Regulations to combat financial crime include anti-money laundering (AML) laws, financial sanctions and monitoring of high-risk individuals. Sanctions are among the most challenging of the financial crime regulations for corporations. In addition to jurisdictional issues, operational decisions on matters such as sanctions list management, transaction currency, customer or employee nationality, local employment laws and transaction routing must be considered.

The multi-jurisdictional challenge

The majority of economic sanctions emanate from the US and Europe. The US Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has recently fined a number of firms  including those operating outside of the US  for sanctions violations. In fact, three of the four entities fined by OFAC for sanctions violations early this year, were corporations and compliance experts believe that the size and scale of fines for corporates is set to grow.

OFAC administers a number of different sanctions programs, covering countries such as Syria, Iran and Russia as well as specially designated nationals (SDNs) who are defined in almost 60 different lists. The sanctions are either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to meet the foreign policy and national security goals of the US.

Other countries, such as the UK and France, have similar bodies to monitor those suspected of financial crime.

Corporates playing catchup

With regulators clearly signalling their intention to take a closer look at corporate compliance with international sanctions, making the assumption that a bank is responsible for protecting its corporate clients against potential violations will not be a mitigating factor when it comes to regulatory action.

As businesses expand across borders, the exposure to potential violations increases and can extend to off-shore affiliates. Many corporates are playing catch up with their understanding of regulatory responsibilities and as their knowledge increases, so does their concern that their internal processes may need to be more robust.

It is true to say that financial crime compliance affects every industry, but some sectors will be more highly exposed to potential violations because of the countries in which they operate, others because of the individuals or institutions with whom they do business.

Airlines, logistics, oil exploration and pharmaceuticals have been relatively proactive in managing their risk, while those companies that operate predominantly in perceived risky jurisdictions have likely been sensitised to the importance of compliance.

There are a number of ways in which corporates can address the issue of regulatory compliance:

#1 Screening financial transactions is a very effective way to mitigate the risk of sanctions violations. This has the added benefit that corporations not only assure themselves that the transaction is compliant, but they can avoid payment blockages where a query on a single transaction could hold up all the remaining payments in a batch. Corporate treasury departments can expedite payments and improve straight-through processing.

#2 Screening customers and suppliers during the on-boarding process is vital, ongoing screening is essential. Checks are made against lists issued by various bodies (including OFAC) to ensure that the countries, companies or individuals with whom they deal are not subject to sanctions.

#3 Sanctions list management is recognised as a challenging task. The lists change regularly, sometimes daily, with names of entities and individuals being added and subtracted. As such, customer and supplier databases would need to be screened regularly to maintain ongoing compliance. Diligence is mandatory, as the job of managing sanctions lists and updating sanctions filters is both complex and time consuming.

#4 Beyond your borders. Although it may be obvious it is worth considering the example that companies operating in the US must comply with US regulations in their everyday business activities, it may not have been as clear that this obligation also extends to organisations outside of the US that are buying US goods, trading in US dollars or have US staff on their payroll who are involved in payment processing.

The onus is on the corporate to be compliant and it must be a high priority to implement effective controls.

Creating a framework for the future

Fighting financial crime remains a high priority for regulators and governments across the world. Regulators and policy makers, although initially focused on the financial industry, are now widening their net to include the broader corporate community.

Corporates can learn from the financial industry and incorporate financial crime compliance into the day-to-day management of their business.

Regulatory compliance costs are going to increase as businesses expand into new countries and every effort has to be made to identify how regulations may affect their business. Implementing practical steps to ensure their compliance is fit for purpose will not only protect reputation and avoid fines; it will ensure their business can prosper as it expands to new territories.

425,"Presidency and diplomacy

Following Rouhanis inauguration in August, he launched a diplomatic campaign to improve Iranian engagement with the West. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Rouhani criticized international sanctions against Iran but emphasized his countrys willingness to seek compromise over the Iranian nuclear program. His conciliatory overtures led to a telephone call with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama in late September, the first direct conversation between a U.S. and an Iranian leader since 1979.

Rouhanis pledge to restart international dialogue regarding Irans nuclear activities was fulfilled in early November with the opening of talks between Iran and a group comprising the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (known collectively as the P5+1). By the end of the month, an interim agreement had been reached that eased sanctions on Iran and placed a variety of restrictions on the nuclear program. A final agreement was reached in July 2015 that required Iran to reduce its nuclear stockpile and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities in exchange for gradual reduction of sanctions. Speaking after the agreement was reached, Rouhani said that it would help build trust between Iran and the West. In January 2016, UN inspectors certified that Iran had made satisfactory progress toward achieving its objectives under the nuclear agreement. This triggered the lifting of international sanctions. The reintegration of Irans economyespecially the petroleum and finance sectorswith the global economy had immediate macroeconomic benefits; GDP growth rose sharply and inflation dropped under 10 percent for the first time since the 1990s.

Rouhani won a second term as president by a landslide in May 2017, winning 57 percent of the vote to 38 percent for his nearest competitor, the conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi. The election results were largely interpreted as a referendum on the nuclear agreement. Rouhani benefited from the enthusiastic support of young Iranians eager for greater economic opportunity and more international engagement. Nonetheless, many Iranians failed to see significant economic improvement in their everyday lives, leading to massive demonstrations in December 2017.

In May 2018 U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear agreement and that sanctions would be reimposed. Other signatories to the treaty agreed to uphold it, though many businesses based in those countries pulled out of Iran and a significant amount of international trade with Iran was cut because of the United States far-reaching sanctions. Rouhani began to take a harder line, and Iran made a show of military exercises, ballistic missile testing, and satellite launches. These moves were met with disapproval from some of the other signatories, who warned that such activities would spread distrust and undermine the agreement.

As it became clear in 2019 that the other signatories could not guarantee the benefits of the agreement, Rouhani announced in May of that year that Iran would begin breaching the agreement. The Iranian government gradually pulled back from its commitments and began carrying out attacks in the region, including in the Gulf of Oman.

In mid-November, as sanctions continued to bite, Rouhani announced that the government would raise fuel prices. Protests erupted across the country, prompting a brutal crackdown accompanied by an unprecedented Internet blackout.",nam

The deputy finance minister also said Najib was not such a person to take government money and Malaysians should not trust the global business newspaper.

""What kind of stupid prime minister would take RM2.46 billion in funds from a government agency into his personal account?

""This is an improbability (kemusaliran) of the greatest kind. If it is true, it is a stupidity (kebebalan yang terlau amat sangat) of the greatest kind,"" he said.

Ahmad said he did not think anyone would be so stupid to keep such a large amount of public funds in their personal account.

He added that he had made a phone call to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) president and group executive director Arul Kanda Kandasamy yesterday, after reading reports of the Finance Ministry's wholly-owned investment vehicle office being raided by police and officers from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Agency (MACC).

He said he had asked Arul if any misappropriation had been carried out by 1MDB and if a single sen from 1MDB had entered the prime minister's account, both of which Arul denied.

""Sometimes, many things are just perceptions. 1MDB is actually a good firm that wants to develop the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) in Kuala Lumpur into a great financial centre,"" said Ahmad.

428,"ARMONK, N.Y. and KOBLENZ, Germany, Jan. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has acquired IRIS Analytics, a privately held company specializing in real-time analytics to help combat payment fraud.

Only 16 percent of banks polled in a recent global IBM Institute of Business Value study could detect fraud as it is attempted. Once new schemes were identified and confirmed, it is estimated that countermeasures typically require over four weeks to deploy 1. Existing fraud detection techniques are constrained by the dependency on specialized ""black box"" models that are hard to understand, explain, and adapt. As the payments industry continues to evolve with faster, alternative and mobile payments innovations and the expanding use of chip & PIN, fraudsters have become more technologically sophisticated and organized, adapting their fraud techniques more quickly.

IRIS provides a real-time fraud analytics engine that leverages machine learning to generate rapid anti-fraud models while also supporting the creation and modification of ad-hoc models, proven successful on various sized payment platforms. Acting as a ""virtual analyst"" to help identify new fraud patterns, IRIS applies machine learning models to help analysts detect fraud and act quickly to help reduce fraudulent events. IRIS serves to bridge the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best fit analytics interactively, while testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.

""The cognitive computing approach unleashes a new paradigm in fighting fraud,"" said Alistair Rennie, general manager, Industry Solutions, IBM. ""By integrating IRIS Analytics with IBM's counter fraud technology, we will help organizations more accurately detect fraud at scale and speed so that they are in a position to implement countermeasures quickly, with more control and transparency, while at the same time assist with dramatically lowering false positives.""

IRIS is in use by leading banks and payment processors throughout the world. For example, the French payment card switch: e-rsb, opérated by STET, utilizes IRIS for 5.5 billion annual credit and debit card transactions. ""With an average response time of less than five milliseconds per transaction even during peak periods when we are processing over 750 transactions per second, IRIS enables us to detect potential fraud without adding any notable overhead to our service,"" states Pierre Juhen, Deputy CEO of STET. ""In addition, we are able to respond to newly identified fraud patterns by deploying new countermeasures in a few hours without taking down the system.""

""Defenses against financial crime are in critical need of innovation and improvement. As the payments industry evolves with new payments methods such as chip and PIN, mobile payments and immediate payments, the ability for financial institutions to accurately make decisions about what is suspicious and what is legitimate before the payment is executed is required,"" said Constantin von Altrock, Chief Executive Officer of IRIS Analytics. ""The combination of IRIS technology with IBM's Counter Fraud capabilities creates a comprehensive solution for real time payment fraud prevention.""

Founded in 2007, IRIS is headquartered in Koblenz, Germany.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Many have chosen to go it alone, but others still find it necessary to hire a pro. Choosing the right financial advisor is critical, and luckily it has become much easier to check on your broker.

In the post-Madoff environment, everyone should check up on their financial advisor's background. It's one of the most basic steps that a majority of investors just dont bother to do. A survey by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that just 15% of investors have checked an advisors background or credentials with a state or federal regulator.

John M. Gannon, senior vice president of investor education at FINRA says knowing that youre doing business with a licensed financial professional is the first critical step in avoiding investment fraud. One of the first things investors should do when considering a financial professional is to look up their licenses and make sure theyre registered. Investors who already have financial professionals should check up their brokers registration on an annual basis, he says.

Gannon is referring to a database on FINRAs Web site dubbed BrokerCheck. FINRA, which is a self-regulatory organization that oversees brokerage firms and their employees, maintains the database that stores some vital information on about 1.3 million current and former FINRA-stockbrokers and 17,000 current and former FINRA-registered brokerage firms.

BrokerChecks files disclose information about a stockbrokers employment history (in and out of the financial services industry), where hes registered, licenses he holds and, perhaps most importantly, it lists any investment related investigations, disciplinary actions, arbitrations, criminal records and bankruptcies.

Those disciplinary actions or disputes, while they dont always tell the whole story, are important when vetting a financial advisor. Dont be hesitant to ask about prior customer disputes or arbitrations with a potential advisor.

Not every financial advisor you come across will be found on FINRAs BrokerCheck. There are more than 275,000 so-called investment advisor representatives registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The main difference between a FINRA registered stockbroker (who carry a Series 7 license) and an SEC-registered investment advisor (Series 65) is that the later is bound by a fiduciary duty meaning the law requires them to put their clients interests before their own.

A Series 7 stockbroker, on the other hand, is held to a suitability standard meaning he is able to sell you investment products that are, well, suitable. In other words, a Series 7 broker could sell you a pricy mutual fund that suits your needs even though theres a less expensive one that does the same.

Its easy to quickly look up either type of advisors records. Investment advisors held to the fiduciary standard must register with the SEC (or state regulator if they manage less than $25 million in assets). Their registration can be found on the SECs Web site through its Investment Adviser Public Disclosure page. Investment advisors are required to disclose more information than their Series 7 counterparts, including the amount of money they manage, the number of clients they work with, the type of clients they typically work with, and types of services offered.

The appeal of an investment advisor is great on the surface. Fiduciary, fee-only conflict free advicewhats not to love? But fee-only investment advice doesnt necessarily mean fraud-free. Lets put it this way, Bernard Madoff was an SEC registered investment advisor.

Also keep in mind that a financial advisor could be registered as both a Series 7 stockbroker with FINRA as well as an investment advisor with the SEC or state regulator. These folks are typically referred to as duallyregistered advisors and can play two roles: one held to a fiduciary standard and the other to the suitability standard. So one minute a dually-registered advisor could be selling you a product thats suitable for your needs and the next he could offer you investment advice that is held to a fiduciary standard.

This is one of the fastest growing sectors within the world of financial advisors. More and more stockbrokers are getting a license to provide fiduciary investment advice. The dual licenses are a nice way for advisors to collect both commissions and offer fee-based investment advice but its confusing for investors.

You should check if an advisor is registered with both FINRA and the SEC. If he is then make sure you always know which hat he is wearing because in a single meeting with you he can switch hats.

While looking up a financial advisors registration should be one of your first steps in your search for an advisor its by no means the only one in the process. Here are some issues to consider on your hunt for a financial advisor:

Make sure your financial advisor can address your specific financial needs. If youre looking for retirement planning help, you want to make sure thats something your advisor has experience with by asking about the types of clients he typically serves, for example.

Referrals are a great way to find an advisor but make sure youre getting them from people whose circumstances and goals are similar to yours. A 40-something single male without children might not have the same definition of a great financial advisor as a 60-something male with a family of five and whose kids are gearing up for college.

Find out how the advisor is paid. This will vary based on the kind of license(s) he has but typically investment advisors are paid on fees, and brokers are paid on commission. When dealing with a broker, ask for his firms commission schedule. Ask investment advisors if their fee is based on assets or time, or if its a flat fee. Remember, dually-licensed advisors are paid both ways so ask the advisor to give you an idea of what your total cost might look like based on your investment needs.

Ask how often the office typically communicates with its clients. Be specific. If the advisor says once a month then asks if those communications are face-toface meetings, phone calls or mailings.

If you need frequent attention (more than once a quarter) from your financial advisor, ask about his client to staff ratio. If he has 300 clients and a staff of 6, chances are your weekly phone calls wont get returned right away. You shouldnt feel bad about wanting to touch base with your financial advisor beyond the usual annual or quarterly meeting especially when the market is volatile, so ask the advisor about his frequency of contact with different clients. If everyone is getting just a quarterly meeting then chances are so will you.

A good place to start looking for an advisor is the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) Web site. NAPFA is an organization whose members are independent, fee-only advisors paid solely by the client and get no compensation based on financial products they recommend.

Most importantly, make sure you shop around for a financial advisor. FINRAs Gannon says investors make a big mistake when they dont comparison shop for advisors.

We spend lots of time comparison shopping for cars, televisions and gadgets but not enough time searching for the right advisor, he says.

What Your Broker's Designations Really Mean

Here, in alphabetical order, is a list of the 20 marks and designations you are most likely to run into during your search for financial advisors.

AEP: The Accredited Estate Planner designation requires the recipient to have five years of estate planning experience. The person must be an attorney or financial planner with appropriate credentials in that field. Given by the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils, the credential requires just two graduate level courses, but

then needs 30 hours of coursework every two years to stay in good standing.

ATA or ATP: An Accredited Tax Advisor or Accredited Tax Preparer has completed the College for Financial Plannings Accredited Tax Preparer Program and passed an exam administered by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy on Taxation.

CAA: A Certified Annuity Advisor must be a lawyer, insurance agent or financial planner, who completes class work (either self-study or in a classroom) developed by Advisor Certification Services.

CAS: The Certified Annuity Specialist designation competes with the CAA. It requires a bachelors degree or one year of experience in financial services and completion of a self-study course and passing an examination administered by the Institute of Business & Finance.

CDP or CDFA: One growing sub-specialty among financial advisors is dealing with divorce cases. A Certified Divorce Planner is an experienced advisor who has completed coursework from The Institute for Certified Divorce Planners, while a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst is an experienced advisor who chose instead to

study with the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts.

CFA: Chartered Financial Analysts pass a rigorous, three-level test on investment analysis, economics, portfolio theory, accounting, corporate finance and more, administered by the CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research). CFAs also must demonstrate expertise in a specialized area of investments.

CFP: Certified Financial Planners must meet experience and education requirements and pass a 10-hour exam given by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. To remain in good standing, they must take at least 30 hours of continuing education classes every two years.

CFS: Certified Fund Specialists need only have a bachelors degree or one year of experience in financial services to take the self-study course and pass an examination administered by the Institute of Business & Finance.

ChFC: Chartered Financial Consultants are typically insurance agents with several years of experience, who have passed courses in financial planning from The American College. It is a credential for an insurance agent who wants to branch into other types of financial planning; many agents get this in conjunction with the CLU credential, since some of the academic requirements are the same.

CIMA: The Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA)a trade group for advisors who specialize in high-net-worth clients and institutional investorsgives the Certified Investment Management Analyst credential to experienced consultants who complete a five-month study program at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago or the University of CaliforniaBerkeley. Candidates cannot have any history of criminal or regulatory violations, civil judicial actions or warranted customer complaints. IMCA has also started awarding the Certified Private Wealth Advisor (CPWA) credential for expertise in the life cycle of wealth.

CLTC: The Certified in Long-Term Care program is run by the CLTC Board of Standards and is one of the few standards that look at the vexing issue of long-term care insurance. That said, the credential has no prerequisites or required experience; it is given for the completion of a correspondence course or a two-day in-person class, plus an exam.

CLU: Chartered Life Underwriter is generally considered the highest professional designation for life insurance agents, who must meet extensive experience and education requirements, with the courses coming from The American College.

CMFC: Chartered Mutual Fund Consultants have completed a 72-hour self-study course on mutual funds. The program is administered by the College for Financial Planning and overseen by the Investment Company Institute, which is the trade association for the mutual fund industry.

CPA: Certified Public Accountants are tax specialists who must have a college degree, pass a strict national exam, and keep current on changes in tax law.

CRPC, CRC, CRFA or CRP: These are four separate-but-similar designations for advisors who want a credential that shows their ability to assist retirees and pre-retirees. Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor, given by the College for Financial Planning, seems to be most popular, but not significantly different from a Certified Retirement Counselor (bestowed by the International Foundation for Retirement Education), a Certified Retirement Financial Advisor (given by the Society of Certified Retirement Financial Advisors), or a Certified Retirement Planner (from Retirement Planners LLC). There is also a PRPSPersonal Retirement Planning Specialist credential, given mostly to insurance professionals looking to broaden their expertise, especially as it comes to selling annuity/lifetime income products.

CSA, CSC or CSFP: Certified Senior Advisors have taken classes on working with senior citizens that go beyond the finances to help them understand the health, insurance, and other issues that could come into play. The same applies to the Certified Senior Consultant and Chartered Senior Financial Planner credentials.

CWM: Chartered Wealth Managers have at least three years experience and typically have an advanced degree. They complete coursework with the American Academy of Financial Management. A similar, competing credential is the CWC, or Certified Wealth Consultant, run by The Heritage Institute.

EA: Enrolled Agents are tax preparers who either worked for the IRS for at least five years or passed a test on federal tax law.

JD: The Juris Doctor is a law degree, not an actual financial-planning credential. That said, there are plenty of lawyers who wind up in financial planning and services, whether that is through estate planning, tax law or getting an additional financial-planning credential. When that happens, you can expect that the JD mark will be prominent among their credentials.

PFS: Personal Financial Specialists are CPAs who have met education and experience requirements and passed a comprehensive exam on financial planning. Because this credential is always linked to the CPAdesignees typically list it as CPA/PFSthe person who has it is typically qualified to help a client with both investment and tax issues. That said, many PFS advisors no longer do tax work and focus more on tax-efficient financial planning.

RIA: Not really a credential at all; when someone tells you hes a registered investment advisor, it simply means that he has registered with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission and has paid a registration fee.",nam
430,"Second leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran

As Khomeinis health declined and it remained unclear who would be both qualified to succeed him and sympathetic to his vision of vel?yat-e faq?h, in 1989 he appointed a council to revise the constitution. Its work had not been completed by the time of his death in June, and it appointed Khamenei as the next rahbar, or leader. However, Khamenei did not meet the qualifications: he was not yet a senior cleric, having been accorded only the somewhat less lofty title of hojatolesl?m. Moreover, he favoured a strongly centralized government under the leader, in part to forestall the influence of foreign powers in domestic politics. Changes to the constitution, approved in a referendum in July, loosened the qualifications, eliminated the post of prime minister and strengthened the presidency, and gave the leader significant power to oversee and intervene in political affairs.

In the early 1990s Khamenei enjoyed a good working relationship with Pres. Hashemi Rafsanjani, another revolutionary figure with whom he was close. His relations with reformist president Mohammad Khatami, however, who served from 1997 to 2005, were strained. Against Khameneis conservatism and deep distrust of the United States, Khatami had a liberalizing agenda and favoured rapprochement with the United States.

Presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

Although Khamenei projected an official neutrality, subtle support for the candidacy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a conservative former mayor of Tehr?n and a relative unknownwas detectable in some of Khameneis speeches prior to Ahmadinejads victory in the 2005 presidential elections. Many found Ahmadinejads success surprising, and it was clear that he would not have been elected without Khameneis support. During his first term in office, Ahmadinejad endeared himself to Khamenei through his bellicose stance toward opponents both at home and abroad, particularly by flaunting the nations nuclear program. Nonetheless, the two at times found themselves at odds, particularly as they engaged in a power struggle in Ahmadinejads second term.

Khameneis leadership saw its strongest challenge during the presidential election of 2009, when Ahmadinejad faced a surprisingly formidable opponent in Mousavi Khameneis former prime minister (198189), around whom the countrys reformist contingent had coalesced. Although preelection polls had shown a tight contest, Ahmadinejad was declared the victor with more than 60 percent of the vote, and the result was quickly endorsed by Khamenei. Suspecting fraud, the opposition rejected the result and gathered to protest, staging massive popular demonstrations in Tehr?n and elsewhere. In some instances, protesters shouted slogans calling for Khameneis downfall. In the media the protests were dubbed the Green Movement, after the colour associated with Mousavis campaign. Although the first protests were largely peaceful, police and paramilitary groups were deployed to suppress them; a handful of protesters and members of the opposition were killed, and many more were arrested. Following nearly a week of protests, Khamenei issued his first public response to the unrest, again supporting Ahmadinejads victory and warning the opposition against further demonstrations. Despite the governments attempts at suppression, protests continued for the rest of the year.

Relations between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad soured during the latters second term as president. It was believed that Ahmadinejad was trying to wrest power from the clerical establishment. Tensions came into public view in April 2011 when Ahmadinejad refused to report to cabinet meetings or his presidential office for 11 days after Khamenei vetoed his dismissal of the minister of intelligence. He returned to work under the threat of impeachment. Ahmadinejad took another provocative step in May, when he named himself acting minister of oil before the clerical establishment could intervene. In March 2012 Ahmadinejad was summoned by the Majles for an unprecedented session of questioning over his policies and his power struggles with Khamenei. Ahmadinejad finished his term in 2013 but was barred from running again in 2017.

Presidency of Hassan Rouhani

Under Ahmadinejads successor, the centrist cleric Hassan Rouhani, Iran changed direction in foreign affairs, moving rapidly toward reducing friction with the West. International negotiations toward an agreement to end Irans nuclear research programs in exchange for the lifting of sanctions began within several months of Rouhanis election in 2013. Throughout the negotiation process, Khamenei maintained a skeptical public posture, voicing objections about aspects of the agreement that he saw as possible infringements on Irans sovereignty. Nevertheless, a final agreement was reached in 2015 with Khameneis approval.

Rouhani won reelection in 2017 in a landslide, but the benefits of lifted sanctions and resolution of the nuclear issue were short-lived. After many Iranians failed to see much relief in their everyday lives, demonstrations broke out in December 2017. They took aim not only at Rouhani but at Khamenei as well. The situation worsened in May 2018 when U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from the nuclear agreement and would reimpose sanctions; despite Iranian compliance with the deal, Trump argued that the deal did not do enough to constrain Iran. In August, as the first set of sanctions went into force, Khamenei rebuked Rouhani for having conceded too much in the arrangements of the 2015 agreement. Nonetheless, he dismissed calls for Rouhani to step down. Rouhanis policy of rapprochement now appeared to be over, and Iran returned to the virulent display of military development that Khamenei had long favoured. This display was condemned by other signatories of the nuclear deal, who had pledged active support to maintain the deal despite U.S. withdrawal.

In 2019, as the renewed sanctions continued to bite and it was becoming apparent that the other signatories were unable to guarantee Iran the benefits of the deal, Khamenei sought a more aggressive government stance in facing the crisis. He categorically rejected renegotiating the agreement with the U.S., backed a gradual breach of the deal, and engaged in hawkish rhetoric. In November, as protests erupted across Iran against a government decision to raise fuel prices, Khamenei ordered a crackdown and dismissed the protesters as thugs.",nam
431,"Each U.S. consumer has, on average, at least one credit card and two bank cards they use to make in-person and online purchases, pay bills and send money to others. Collectively, U.S. consumers make billions of noncash transactions every year; these are prime targets of cybercriminals looking to walk away with as much of that money as they can.

Although the rate of cybercrime and attempted fraud increases each year, the portion of lost e-commerce revenue by North American merchants is just under 1%, according to the 2014 CyberSource Online Fraud Report, a number that's remained fairly static since 2010. Experts point to the efficient management of web fraud as the key reason. Even so, payment fraud is a great concern to consumers, and merchants and financial institutions take the hit for most of the money lost as a result of fraud in the form of refunds and chargebacks.

Web fraud detection explained

Organizations that accept payment cards over the web -- also referred to as card not present (CNP) transactions -- or organizations that back those payments, will deploy web fraud detection software or services to detect and help prevent fraud.

Web fraud detection systems typically focus on new account origination, account takeover and payment fraud. With account takeover and new account origination fraud detection, organizations attempt to root out unauthorized or fraudulent users posing as legitimate users. Payment fraud detection involves determining whether purchases are being or have been made with stolen payment cards. Some vendors also offer fraud intelligence services, authentication, malware detection (such as man-in-the-browser infections on computers and mobile devices) and secure clients, as well as managed services in which the vendor is primarily responsible for monitoring and taking action on instances of fraud.

Web fraud detection system vendors generally provide either an on-premises software product or platform, or a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) that scans financial transactions made via the web or with mobile devices.

How web fraud detection works

Web fraud detection software (or a cloud-based service) runs background processes that scan transactions and score them based on the possibility of fraud. Many different data points are considered to determine the score, such as user behavior, device ID, other device characteristics, geolocation, order links and so on. The data is then compared against ""normal"" attributes. If the transaction is deemed valid, it's allowed and processed. If the transaction falls outside of an accepted range, an alert is issued and the transaction may be automatically suspended or denied.

To detect fraud, vendors typically use either a predictive behavioral scoring model, in which an account holder's behavior is the predominant criteria, or a rule-based system that uses pattern recognition. Some products or services use both types of scoring models.

Even with automated systems available, organizations still need to manually analyze certain transactions, such as those that an automated tool flags as fraudulent.

Who needs web fraud detection services? Organizations of all sizes -- from SMBs to enterprises -- that deal with any volume of CNP transactions that are too burdensome or time-intensive to review manually should have some type of fraud detection in place. Specific customers include banking and financial services institutions, e-commerce merchants, human resources and payroll services, and social networking sites, just to name a few. Web fraud detection services especially help organizations that need to meet Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements.

How is web fraud detection sold? SaaS offerings are the most straight-forward approach to web fraud detection. A customer simply signs up for a service and agrees to pay a monthly fee based on the number of anticipated transactions (or a similar metric). The customer can scale the fraud detection service up or down as its needs change.

On-premises software requires an upfront cost for the software and any hardware or infrastructure upgrades required to support the software. Companies that lack a full-time security support team (most often small to midsize companies) may need to pay the vendor for initial setup just to get the software up and running properly, plus minimal staff training.

Managing and supporting web fraud detection

Web fraud detection management and support varies depending on how it's implemented.

SaaS-based web fraud detection is hosted by a service provider; customers access the service through a configuration interface to customize settings and perform typical administrative tasks.

On-premises web fraud detection systems require more administrative effort for installation and maintenance of the server on which the software runs, for the software itself, and for the customer's network infrastructure.

Web fraud detection systems and services can't detect every instance of fraud, but they greatly reduce a merchant's or financial institution's risk and provide a high level of protection to consumers.

Features

Frank Abagnale, a former imposter and fraudster who wrote the book Catch Me If You Can believes ""punishment for fraud and the recovery of stolen funds [is] so rare, prevention is the only viable course of action."" An organization that conducts business over the web should interpret that statement to include detection as well. That is, prevention of web fraud is a combination of accurate fraud detection along with layers of security that help to protect users, devices and networks.

Web fraud detection, sometimes referred to as online fraud detection, is a set of services or a software product that detects fraudulent transactions or activities conducted over the web. A typical web fraud detection system detects new account origination (identity fraud), account takeover (stolen user credentials) and payment fraud (e.g., with a stolen credit card), but can offer much more. How a web fraud detection system accomplishes detection and to what extent is what sets one tool apart from the others. So it's important to understand key features available in a fraud detection tool in order to evaluate these products and choose the best for your company.

Sector focus: Some web fraud detection vendors focus specifically on the banking/financial services industry or e-commerce, whereas others offer products that claim to tackle nearly any type of sector that maintains online accounts and conducts transactions.

A financial services company may best be served by a web fraud detection system created specifically for that industry. The same applies to e-commerce and retailers. Government agencies offering e-government services, social networking sites, insurance companies and so forth can broaden their research to look at sector-neutral products (those that support many different verticals), which represent the lion's share of available products.

Multiple layers: In both its Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection (revised on July 21, 2015) and in previous publications, Gartner highly recommends using multiple fraud-prevention layers designed to help prevent or stop further damage from internet-based malware attacks. The most significant layers involve endpoints (Layer 1), navigation (Layer 2) and users or entities (Layer 3).

According to Gartner's layering scheme, an endpoint product analyzes computer, mobile device or telephony device characteristics, such as recent login data, and provides validation of a user's account privileges. A navigation system analyzes session navigation for anomalies. A user- or entity-centric product compares transactions to the ""norm"" for that user or entity, for a specific channel such as e-commerce.

Many web fraud detection systems provide protection for all three layers; others focus on only one layer. It's possible to get complete coverage from various products, but it makes sense to look for a product that provides protection at all three layers.

Analytics and continuous profiling: Rule-based analytics rely on pattern recognition, which is based on what is already known. Predictive behavioral analytics look at an account holder's behavior and seek anomalies based on expected behavior. Models produce risk scores, which are evaluated against user or entity profiles created from the results of analytics.

Products that get high marks in this category are those that provide continuous profiling of accounts and users to detect fraud, using one or both analytical models, though behavioral analytics is somewhat preferable over rule-based.

Integration of external intelligence: One part of the security industry that's gained significant traction in recent years is threat intelligence. A threat intelligence service gathers raw data about emerging threats from several sources (and perhaps millions of endpoints), and then analyzes and filters that data to produce useable information.

Security control systems, such as security information and event management and next-gen firewalls, use threat intelligence to better protect an organization from emerging or zero-day threats. An identity intelligence service, or identify proofing service, provides an analysis of user identity and access characteristics (user roles, policy violations, biometric data and so on), gathered from public and proprietary data sources. Identity intelligence is often used to verify a person's identity before an organization approves an account and issues credentials.

For the most comprehensive coverage, organizations should give preference to web fraud detection systems that can integrate external threat intelligence and/or identity intelligence. In fact, the majority of products are expected to provide this feature by 2017.

Compliance: Ensure your organizations choice of web fraud detection system meets the requirements of all necessary compliance regulations. For example, if an organization accepts payment cards, it should ask if the product under consideration carry PCI DSS-certification.

Many organizations need to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or FACTA Red-Flags, or require SSAE 16 or ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management. Keep a list of the organization's compliance requirements handy when vetting web fraud detection systems and ask each vendor on the short list to provide documentation that indicates the product's compliance support.

Other considerations: Web fraud detection vendors typically provide downloadable data sheets, brochures and similar product assets on their websites to prospective customers. Be sure to check the copyright dates on the available assets, especially the data sheets, and consider dropping from consideration any products with asset dates older than a year or two. Web fraud detection systems must adapt to a constant influx of new threats, and incorporate innovation to remain relevant and competitive. Old assets may be an indicator of a product that's not technologically fresh and effective.

As organizations research vendors and products, they'll read about how the web fraud detection industry has undergone a lot of churn since 2013, mainly from mergers and acquisitions. When a vendor is acquired to fill in a technology gap in a portfolio, innovation can suffer. When talking to each vendor sales rep, be sure to ask the following:

The bottom line

Evaluating web fraud detection systems requires more than a search through data sheets and marketing materials, all of which can be misleading and out of date. Take advantage of one-on-one demos offered by the vendors, during which you can ask the sales reps specific product questions in relation to your organization's industry/channel and transaction volume. That's the best time to establish realistic pricing as well, because most web fraud detection systems are based on volume.

In more than 14 years as prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has become both Israel's longest-serving leader and the first to face criminal prosecution while in office.

Lauded by his supporters as ""King Bibi"" and as a ""magician"" for his knack of winning elections, the leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party is fighting for his political survival as he prepares to stand trial on corruption charges.

His success in polls has owed much to his image as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.

He has taken a hard line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any discussion of peace, and long warned of danger from Iran.

Brother's legacy

Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949. In 1963 his family moved to the US when his father Benzion, a prominent historian and Zionist activist, was offered an academic post.

At the age of 18, Benjamin returned to Israel, where he spent five distinguished years in the army, serving as a captain in an elite commando unit, the Sayeret Matkal. He took part in a raid on Beirut's airport in 1968 and fought in the 1973 Middle East war.

After his military service, Mr Netanyahu went back to the US, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

In 1976, Mr Netanyahu's brother, Jonathan, was killed leading a raid to rescue hostages from a hijacked airliner in Entebbe, Uganda. His death had a profound impact on the Netanyahu family, and his name became legendary in Israel.

Mr Netanyahu set up an anti-terrorism institute in his brother's memory and in 1982 became Israel's deputy chief of mission in Washington.

Overnight, Mr Netanyahu's public life was launched. An articulate English speaker with a distinctive American accent, he became a familiar face on US television and an effective advocate for Israel.

Mr Netanyahu was appointed Israel's permanent representative at the UN in New York in 1984.

Rise to power

Only in 1988, when he returned to Israel, did he become involved in domestic politics, winning a seat for the Likud party in the Knesset (parliament) and becoming deputy foreign minister.

He later became party chairman, and in 1996, Israel's first directly elected prime minister after an early election following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.

image copyrightGetty Images

Mr Netanyahu was also Israel's youngest leader and the first to be born after the state was founded in 1948.

Despite having fiercely criticised the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, Mr Netanyahu signed a deal handing over 80% of Hebron to Palestinian Authority control and agreed to further withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.

He lost office in 1999 after he called elections 17 months early, defeated by Labour leader Ehud Barak, Mr Netanyahu's former commander.

Political revival

Mr Netanyahu stepped down and was succeeded as Likud leader by Ariel Sharon.

After Mr Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001, Mr Netanyahu returned to government, first as foreign minister and then as finance minister. In 2005, he resigned in protest at the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip.

His chance came again in 2005, when Mr Sharon - just before a massive stroke that left him in a coma - split from Likud and set up a new centrist party, Kadima.

Life and times

1949 - born in Tel Aviv
1967-73 - serves as soldier commando captain
1984 - becomes ambassador to UN
1988 - enters Knesset and government
1996 - becomes prime minister
1999 - loses election
2002-03 - serves as foreign minister
2003-05 - serves as finance minister; resigns over withdrawal from Gaza
Dec 2005 - wins back leadership of Likud party
2009 - returns as prime minister
2013 - re-elected as prime minister
2015 - wins fourth term
2019 - charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust
2020 - begins fifth term

Mr Netanyahu won the Likud leadership again and was elected prime minister for the second time in March 2009.

He agreed an unprecedented 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, enabling peace talks with Palestinians, but negotiations collapsed in late-2010.

Although in 2009 he publicly announced his conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he later toughened his position. ""A Palestinian state will not be created, not like the one people are talking about. It won't happen,"" he told an Israeli radio station in 2019.

Conflict in Gaza

Despite his tough rhetoric and fulsome support for Israeli military action, Mr Netanyahu has not managed to put a stop to attacks from Palestinian militants under Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

In late 2012, he ordered a major offensive after an escalation of rocket fire into Israel, but stopped short of sending in ground troops.

However, after a relative lull, cross-border violence flared again and after a surge of rocket attacks in July 2014, Mr Netanyahu ordered another military campaign.

The 50-day war left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead, most of them civilians, according to UN and Palestinian officials. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.

Although during the conflict Israel had the support of the United States, its closest ally, relations between Mr Netanyahu and President Barack Obama were difficult.

They reached a low point when Mr Netanyahu addressed Congress in March 2015, warning against a ""bad deal"" arising out of US negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme. The Obama administration condemned the visit as interfering and damaging.

Trump ties

The advent of Donald Trump's presidency in 2017 led to a closer alignment between US and Israeli government policies, and within a year Mr Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

The move sparked fury across the Arab world - which supports the Palestinians' claim to the eastern half of Jerusalem occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war - but it handed Mr Netanyahu a major political and diplomatic coup.

Just over a year later, Mr Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, further reversing decades of US policy and earning Mr Netanyahu's praise.

And in January, Mr Netanyahu was in Washington for the launch of Mr Trump's ""vision for peace"" between Israel and the Palestinians.

The prime minister hailed it as the ""opportunity of the century"" and vowed to move swiftly to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley that were allocated to Israel under Mr Trump's proposals. The Palestinians rejected the plan, calling it ""the slap of the century"".

Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump also see eye-to-eye on Iran. The prime minister has repeatedly warned of the danger to the international community of leaving it with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. In 2018, he welcomed Mr Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and Washington's strengthening of economic sanctions against it.

Shadow of charges

In the past few years, Mr Netanyahu has been dogged by a long corruption investigation, which culminated in him being charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases in November 2019.

Mr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage.

He denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a politically motivated ""witch hunt"" engineered by his opponents.

Even if he is convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down as prime minister until the appeals process was exhausted - something that could take years.

'National emergency government'

Despite the corruption claims, Mr Netanyahu survived three inconclusive general elections in less than a year and won a record fifth term in office.

In each of the polls his main challenger was Benny Gantz, a former military chief who built an opposition movement on the basis of popular discontent with Mr Netanyahu.

Mr Gantz vowed never to sit with a prime minister under criminal indictment. But after failing to form a coalition with a majority in the Knesset after February's election, and with Israel battling the Covid-19 pandemic, he agreed to form a ""national emergency government"" with Mr Netanyahu.",am
433,"How hard is it to ferret out securities fraud? It might be as easy as looking for how many times the digit `1 appears in a company's financial entries instead of 9.

A simple mathematical law that applies to everything from the height of mountains to the population of towns in Tajikistan can also be used to uncover suspicious numbers in public-company accounting, an expert at Columbia Business School says in a new paper.

Benfords Law states that the quantity of most things in the real world is more likely to be described by a number beginning in 1 than any other digit, and the likelihood of it being described by other digits declines as those digits get higher.

When Columbias Dan Amiram and two coauthors applied Benfords Law to public companies, they found the same rules hold true: Companies whose financial statements were significantly out of compliance with the law were far more likely to get caught by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities. And when companies restated their earnings, a before-and-after comparison showed that the new, real numbers complied with Benfords Law while the old ones didnt.

It was absolutely shocking, Amiram said of the study with coauthors Zahn Bozanic of Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business and Ethan Rouen of Columbia, which he says already has drawn inquiries from hedge funds, short-sellers annd the SEC. Every year, every industry fits perfectly to Benfords Law.

That result might seem absurd, or at least counterintuitive, given the presumably random nature of things like the number of widgets sold or profit from an aluminum smelter. Why is it more likely that a company sold 10 widgets, or 10,000, in a year than 700 or 700,000?

The answer reflects the intersection of statistics and our method of counting things. As a pure matter of math, increasing the quantity of anything from 1 to 2, or 100 to 200, or 1 million to 2 million, means a 100% increase, whereas an increase from 9 to 10, or 9 million to 10 million, only requires an 11% increase. That means any count of something in the real world is far more likely to begin with a low digit than a high digit, including when a company starts the year with revenue of $0 and increases that figure each day.

In this world, there are more small things than large things, explained Mark Nigrini, a professor of accounting at West Virginia University and author of Benford's Law, a 100,000-word treatise on the practical application of the law toward fraud, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion and other skullduggery. Any town or city would have a population with a first digit of 1 far longer than any other digit.

The actual statistical probability under Benfords Law is 30% for the digit 1, 17.6% for 2, 12.5% for 3, and so on down to 4.6% for 9. And thats what Amiram found when he studied more than 40,000 public-company annual reports from 2001 to 2011. Benford's Law described those results in aggregate, whether across the entire dataset or industry by industry. Nearly 86% of the firm-year observations complied with the law.

Things got more interesting when he looked at companies that were busted by the SEC. (He drew his data from the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases database.) There, he found companies that were ultimately caught in accounting improprieties had a statistical measure of deviation from the results predicted by Benfords Law of more than 20 times the average for all firms. Even more fascinating, that measure of deviation plunged in the three years before the companies were caught, supporting the widely accepted theory that the SEC only uncovers frauds after they start falling apart and companies can no longer fudge their numbers.

This method has the same flaw as many other fraud-detection tools: It turns up a lot of false positives, or at least companies that never show up in the SEC's enforcement database. Amiram suspects many of the companies that deviate significantly from Benfords Law may actually be cooking the books but will never be caught, either because of the SECs limited enforcement budget or because they escape the agencys five-year statute of limitations.

The reliability of this tool for detecting fraud is supported, however, by direct observations of companies that have restated earnings. Those companies showed a statistically significant shift from non-compliance with Benford's Law to compliance before and after they restated earnings.

For same firm year, the same operation, the same firm, we have two sets of numbers, Amiram said. The corrected numbers are very close to Benfords law, and the previous ones are absolutely off.

To give one example, Sprint Nextel s financials deviated from the distribution of digits predicted by Benfords Law in the two years before it restated earnings in 2001, and fell into compliance after that. AT&T results, by comparison, followed the law the entire time.

Fraudsters can try and fudge their numbers in a way that complies with Benfords predictions, but it wont be easy. In another test, Amiram deliberately altered Alcoa s financial results for 2011, changing sales, cost of goods sold and taxes randomly in 1,000 simulations. Alcoas measure of deviation increased practically every time.

Benfords Law has been used in a large number of forensic applications, including voter fraud, Greece's effort to hide its debt, and determining whether digital photographs have been altered. It's also been in the toolkit of auditors for years, said Amiram, a former auditor, but only at the level of operating accounts. He said his paper is the first to apply the law to company-level financial reports accessible through databases like Compustat.

Amiram began thinking about a Benford's Law screen on financial results after a friend who is a professor at Dartmouth sent him a Facebook link to the `10 Weirdest Math Facts."" He detailed Rouen, a Ph.D candidate, to study financial reports and quickly became convinced they had ""finally found one of the most useful applications of that law.""He's spoken to the SEC about his research, but doesn't know if the agency is using it.

Now he plays a parlor game with his students, separating them into groups of ""truth-tellers"" and ""liars"" with the first group compiling a list of the lengths of major world rivers and the second one making the numbers up. Benford's Law identifies the liars every time, he said.

When it comes to financial fraud, he said: ""If you manipulate the numbers, 90% of the time youre going to violate Benfords Law.""

Given the apparently rampant level of securities fraud that plaintiff lawyers claim to find each year, it is surprising they haven't turned to this tool as a first screen to determine whether they're suing the right company. Maybe they could even use it to find real examples of fraud, instead of waiting for the company or the SEC to disclose it first.",nam
434,"Its rather odd to have an industry thats purging talent nearly across the board at mid and senior-levels while desperately hiring in one particular business area. But thats essentially whats happening on Wall Street. Banks are cutting costs and slicing salaries virtually everywhere. Just not in compliance.

Banks facing mountains of litigation and red tape from new regulations are thirsty for compliance staffers at all levels, and many are paying top dollar for the best candidates.

Deutsche Bank recently announced a plan to hire 500 compliance employees, BNP needs 475 extra compliance people and Standard Chartered has upped its compliance staff headcount by 30%. Then there is JPMorgan, which wants 13,000 more people working in controls, with a mix of fresh hires and internal transfers. Theyre reported paying contractors north of $100 an hour for their services.

Clearly, the market has never been better for experienced compliance personnel. But what if your resume is missing that all-important experience aspect?

Touch the corners

The short answer is: it's not easy. Compliance is tough to break into if you dont have the background, says Michael Lane, managing director of Compliance Search Group. Banks tend to want to hire big-name talent with direct experience. There are only so many veteran people to poach, though, so opportunities are starting to arrive for those with experience that touches compliance.

The best way to find a job in compliance is through a legal or operations track, says Anne Crowley, managing director at Jay Gaines and Company. Lawyers who work at banks, particularly those who work closely with general counsel, are beginning to earn more roles in compliance, added Neil Owen, global practice director of financial services recruitment for Robert Half. Even past experience as a paralegal can be beneficial, said Suzanne Havranek, fulfillment manager at Wall Street Services.

If you dont have your JD, working in back-office operations  particularly in reconciliations  is a good starting point, said Crowley. Banks want people who have been in the trenches, who understand the fault lines, she said.

A great route for people with little experience is by working with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence controls, experts say. Banks often hire for these roles on a temporary basis, said Owen, giving prospective compliance employees an opportunity for exposure.

There is absolutely an opportunity to transfer those skills into compliance, Owen said. Client on-boarding is another way to gain exposure to compliance issues, says Havranek.

Finally, go work at a regulator. Banks often pull people from FINRA, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), not to mention state agencies.

Certifications

Earning a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS) credential will go a long way to opening doors. For senior-level roles, passing the Series 24 Exam administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a must. The American Banker Association runs a week-long compliance school in the autumn that is widely recognized.

Depending upon the specialization, firms like to see candidates with their CFA, MBA or Series 6 and 7. Audit and accounting training are big pluses as well.

Soft skills

Finding work in compliance isnt just about experience and education, although thats the minimum price of entry. Candidates need have a backbone to find work and be successful.

You dont need to be a jerk, but you need to be innately inquisitive, said Crowley. You often need to stand up to senior people. You need to be willing to say show me, not tell me.

That said, you must also be approachable. Employees should want to come to you with anything, Crowley said. But above all else, you must be ethical and honest, according to Owen.

Upside

Compliance is so much more attractive than it was five to six years ago, Owen said. With the deluge of problems banks have had, the attitude toward compliance officers has changed dramatically. Youre not looked at as a cop, Lane said. Youre an integral part of the business now.

Several chief compliance officers have recently been named to banks executive committees - something that would have been unheard of just a few years ago.

There is real opportunity for career progression, Owen said.

Downside

Compliance departments within banks are structured much differently than they were years ago. As the units have gotten bigger, teams and individuals are beginning to be siloed into very specific roles, like covering one new regulation, according to George Kennedy, head of recruitment at Maywater Limited, a London-based international compliance consultancy and compliance recruitment firm.

Being a specialist helps with pay, but siloed teams also offer limited exposure and the work can turn dull.

Then there is the workload, says Kennedy. Despite the hiring, banks remain understaffed (hence the rising pay). The hours are longer and the stress associated with the job is on the rise, he says. The threat of having a blowup on your watch is ever-present.

In our recent informal survey, compliance and risk ranked as the third most stressful area in the industry, behind only investment banking and trading.",nam
435,"iBEIJING: After backing the BRICS declaration on terrorism naming Pakistan-based militant groups, China today said it will extend support to the fight against terrorist financing and money laundering in non-financial sectors.

""Money laundering and terrorist financing activities are gradually spreading to some non-financial sectors,"" the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, said in a statement, noting the risks in sectors like real estate intermediary services and jewellery sales.

The PBOC has already started monitoring and analysis in some of these sectors and will work with relevant government departments on anti-money laundering rules for non-financial industries, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported today.

Since China's anti-money laundering law became effective in 2007, supervision has improved, covering almost every financial sector, such as banking, securities, insurance, non-banking payment institutions and bank card clearing institutions.

According to a government guideline, made public earlier this week, China will coordinate supervision to counter money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.

By 2020, China should be able to effectively prevent and control money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion by improving laws and regulations and coordinating the work of different government departments, the statement issued last night said.

Observers say China's backing for anti-money laundering and terror financing efforts could lead to more effective measures at the international level to cut sources of finance to global terror outfits.

Shedding its earlier reservations, China had backed a tough declaration at the BRICS Summit earlier this month in Chinese city of Xiamen and identified Taliban, ISIL/DAISH, Al-Qaida and its affiliates, including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Hizb ut-Tahrir as terrorist groups.

""We deplore all terrorist attacks ... and condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever and stress that there can be no justification for any act of terrorism,"" the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, (BRICS) statement had said.

Considerable significance was attached to China endorsing the statement specially against militant outfits based in Pakistan, its closest ally, at the BRICS Summit in Xiamen as it had resisted their inclusion at last year's Summit in Goa.

The PBOC also dismissed concerns over strengthened government supervision of abnormal cross-border capital flow, saying that the monitoring will not disrupt normal and legal use of cross-border capital.

The monitoring work will be carried out backstage and does not require further information from citizens and enterprises, the central bank said.",nam
436,"Denmarks State Serum Institute, which deals with infectious diseases, has found mink-related strands of the novel coronavirus in 214 people since June, according to a report on its website updated on November 5.

Meanwhile, one strain of the mutated coronavirus, which has prompted Denmark to cull its entire herd of mink, has been found in 12 people and on five mink farms so far.

Early this week, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the government wants to cull all minks on farms to minimise the risk of the weasel-like mammals re-transmitting COVID-19 to humans.

It is very, very serious, Frederiksen said. Thus, the mutated virus in minks can have devastating consequences worldwide.

Health minister Magnus Heunicke said half the 783 human COVID-19 cases in northern Denmark are related to minks.

The development has prompted fresh measures to stem the spread of the virus; more than a quarter million Danes went into lockdown Friday in a northern region of the country where the mutated variation of the coronavirus has infected minks being farmed for their fur.

The coronavirus evolves constantly and, to date, there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. But Danish authorities were not taking any chances.

In seven northern Denmark municipalities with some 280,000 residents sport and cultural activities have been suspended, public transportation has been stopped and regional borders have been closed.

Only people with so-called critical functions such as police and health officials and different authorities are being permitted to cross municipal boundaries.

People in the region have been urged to to be tested. As of Saturday, restaurants must close, and school students from fifth grade and up will switch to remote learning Monday.

We must knock down completely this virus variant, Heunicke said on Thursday.

Denmark is one of the worlds main mink fur exporters, producing an estimated 17 million furs a year. Kopenhagen Fur, a cooperative of 1,500 Danish breeders, accounts for 40 percent of global mink production. Most of its exports go to China and Hong Kong.

According to government estimates, culling the countrys 15 million minks could cost up to five billion kroner ($785m). National police head Thorkild Fogde said: It should happen as soon as possible.

Denmarks minister for food, Mogens Jensen, said 207 farms were now infected, up from 41 last month, and the disease has spread to all of the western peninsula of Jutland.

Last month, Denmark started culling millions of minks in the north of the country. The government has promised to compensate farmers.

The country has registered 52,265 confirmed COVID-19 infections and 733 related deaths.",nam
437,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday put the blame of its failure to completely crack down on money laundering and terror financing on the United States and said Washington was not actively supporting its bid for membership of a global alliance.

In its capacity as co-sponsor, the US was not actively supporting Pakistans request for membership of the Egmont Group  a club of financial intelligence units (FIU) of 156 nations, said Syed Mansoor Ali, the Director General of Pakistans Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU).

Ali made the statement in a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that had called officials of the State Bank and the finance ministry to get an update on Pakistans request for the groups membership.

The Egmont Group provides a platform for the secure exchange of expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Money laundering: FIA books Altaf Hussain for 'misusing KKF funds'

The official said in reply to a question that he did not know the reason behind the lacklustre US support for Pakistans membership. It is mandatory for an applicant state to seek the sponsorship of two members of the Egmont Group and the US and Japan had given their consent to Pakistans application.

Ali said both the US and Japans FIUs had visited Pakistan in November 2012 for observing the FMUs facilities and systems.

The Financial Action Task Force  an inter-governmental body working to combat money laundering  recommends that its members seek the membership of Egmont Group also.

In September 2011, the federal cabinet permitted the initiation of the process of seeking the Egmont Groups membership. It also approved allowing the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) and Japans Financial Intelligence Centre (JAFIC) to sponsor Pakistans membership.

Pakistan applied for the groups membership in 2012 and the FINCEN and JAFIC conducted the onsite visits of the FMU. On the basis of their report, the Operation Working Group of Egmont technically cleared Pakistans membership, said Ali.

NAB urged to probe money laundering allegations against Chinese company

However, the Legal Working Group of the organisation found some deficiencies in Pakistans Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act and rejected the application, he added.

Ali said that unlike foreign FIUs single-stage agreement, the FMU was following a two-tier system for sharing information. Pakistan addressed this legal objection in December 2015 by amending the AML law and adopting the single-stage agreement with the counterparts for the exchange of information.

Pakistan had shared the latest status with both Japan and the US, requesting them to resume the process of its membership, he said. But the US is not actively taking up our request and we do not know the reasons, said Ali.

Implications

The FMU and the law enforcement agencies are not able to completely analyse or investigate money laundering and terrorism financing cases wherever foreign jurisdictions are involved, according to the units written statement shared with the standing committee.

Zardari's aide facilitated Ayyan in 'money laundering', says ASF official

It added that mostly illicit money emanating from Pakistan due to corruption and organised and other serious crimes went out of the country.

The assets acquired in Pakistan or abroad through illicit proceeds could be traced on the receipt of intelligence from the foreign FIUs or sharing of information with them, it added.

Absence of any mechanism to exchange financial intelligence with other FIUs leaves us devoid of the opportunity to trace back the suspicious transactions having international dimensions, according to the FMU statement.

The platform of the Egmont would help the FMU in analysing the suspicious transactions and tracing the proceeds of crime, uncovering criminal assets across member countries by following the trail, thereby helping the FMU and LEAs in successfully combating the menace of money laundering and terrorist financing, it said.

I have got an impression during my interactions with foreign dignitaries that Pakistan was resisting to be part of Egmont Group, said Saleem Mandviwalla, the committees chairman. He asked the finance ministry to actively pursue the case and report back to the committee next month.

Mansoor Ali said the groups membership was very important for Pakistan and expressed the hope that the country might be able to get it next year. He said that despite engagements with the US, there had been no productive results so far.",nam
438,"By Paul McCloskey

One of the big guns in the governments battle to reduce improper health care claims is the Fraud Prevention System (FPS), a nearly four-year effort by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to help automate the review of health care claims before, during and after they are filed. FPS is critical to CMS plan to move away from pay and chase to a prevention model of claims management in its fight against fraud.

In the past, CMS typically paid a claim, then checked its validity before making a decision to try to recover the funds if it discovered they had been paid improperly. That approach has made it easy for fraudsters to elude regulators by sending up a smoke screen of false claims and counter-claims during the payment process.

FPS uses predictive analytics to flag providers and other players in the health care supply chain who might have participated in payment fraud.

As in anti-fraud approaches in the credit card industry, FPS enables CMS to assign risk scores to specific claims and providers, thereby establishing a starting point for analysts to pursue a potential fraud case.

When FPS identifies irregular activity, it automatically generates potential investigative leads for program integrity contractors  the teams of experts and data scientists who can help identify actions that can be taken immediately, such as suspending payment or launching a case review.

CMS officials say the success of FPS often depends on quickly detecting fraudulent payments, a goal for which it is enhancing some of its response systems. Responding to a suggestion by the Government Accountability Office, CMS has improved the integration of FPS with its claims-processing system, giving FPS the ability to stop payment of improper claims by transmitting a claim denial message directly to the payment system.

What this means is that FPS can identify billing patterns and claim aberrancies that would be undetectable or difficult to detect by CMS current claim edit modules or a single contractor reviewing on a claim-by-claim basis, Shantanu Agrawal, director of the CMS Center for Program Integrity, said during a hearing held earlier this year by the House Ways and Means Committees Oversight Subcommittee.

Industry players say FPS shows promise but is still young. Louis Saccoccio, CEO of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, told the subcommittee that it will take time to effectively refine and adjust the models for such a large and complex system as Medicare in order to realize the full potential that these powerful technologies offer.

439,"The signing of the deal normalising relations between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates caused a stir in the Middle East. It seems Israel is increasingly gaining political ground in the region, expanding trade and financial relations, and solidifying an Arab-Israeli axis against Iran. All of this is happening against the will of the Palestinian people and without any concession from the Israelis.

These developments have raised a number of important questions on the political scene in the Middle East. Does this diplomatic success for Israel mean that the Palestinian question has been completely sidelined in Arab politics? Have Palestinians lost their veto power on the normalisation of relations between Arab states and Israel? Will the UAE be able to bypass the Palestinians, the original owners of the cause, and come up with a solution to the Palestinian issue?

The Palestinian loss of veto power

For decades, there has been a consensus among Arab states that any dealings with Israel have to be conditioned on a land for peace arrangement that includes its withdrawal from the territories it occupied during the 1967 war. That is, the Israelis would have to give up occupied territory for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in exchange for normalising relations with Arab countries.

This consensus gave an unspoken veto power on normalisation to the Palestinians, making the resolution of the Palestinian issue the only way in which Israel would be accepted in the Arab world.

What the Emirati-Bahraini-Israeli agreement has done is basically sideline this past Arab consensus on how to deal with the Palestinian issue and make public what has been going on informally for years  the normalisation of relations between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi.

It demonstrates Emirati and Bahraini disregard for the long-term Arab position of land for peace. Abu Dhabi and Manama have effectively given the Israelis what they want  open political relations, trade, and backing for their anti-Iran confrontation efforts  without any real concessions on the Palestinian issue.

For the Palestinians, this is a clear attempt to preserve the status quo and allow the Israelis to continue stealing Palestinian land, demolishing Palestinian homes, imprisoning and killing Palestinians and altogether solidifying their apartheid rule. Contrary to what the Emiratis have claimed, this deal has not stopped the annexation of Palestinian lands on the ground.

The Israelis do not hide their optimism that establishing full diplomatic relations with the UAE and Bahrain will open the door to establishing full relations with other countries, such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and perhaps Sudan. If these normalisation deals continue, then it would mean that the Palestinians have lost their veto power on normalisation with Israel and their cause has lost its political value to the Arab regimes.

While the deal is indeed bad news for the Palestinians, it is important not to exaggerate its significance. Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Washington have touted it as a peace for peace (as opposed to land for peace) initiative, trying to equate it to the peace agreements Egypt and Jordan concluded with Israel in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the architect of the deal, like most Israelis, knows very well that any such comparison is unrealistic.

After all, neither Bahrain nor the UAE has actually been at war with Israel and they also have no common borders, unlike Jordan and Egypt, which waged deadly wars against the Israelis. The peace deals that the two countries signed with Israel not only put an end to hostilities but also forced Israel to withdraw from territories it had occupied.

Nothing of such political importance was contained in the peace deal that Bahrain, the UAE and Israel signed last month.

The UAE, a peacemaker?

As bad as this deal is for the Palestinians, it does not make the Palestinian issue go away. Despite all the noise and PR, Israelis very well realise that normalisation of relations with Gulf nations will not get rid of millions of Palestinians. It cannot erase them from history or from reality.

There seems to be some hope among some moderate Israelis that the UAE, the new self-declared peacemaker of the region, could use the deal as a stepping stone and wield its influence to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a recent article, former Israeli diplomat, Nadav Tamir, wrote about the possibility of Abu Dhabi initiating new negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Tel Aviv to produce a settlement that includes a separate Palestinian state.

The success of such an initiative, however, is highly unlikely, given that the relations between Ramallah and Abu Dhabi are at an all-time low. The PA has made it clear it considers the Emirati deal with Israel a betrayal and has issued strongly-worded condemnations.

If the UAE fails to play a useful role in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians, Tamir fears that the agreement with the UAE could turn from a tactical achievement to strategic harm.

In the short-term, normalisation with Israel only adds to the isolation of the PA and could benefit Hamas  something that is not in the interest of Israel, which has long used the authorities in Ramallah to indirectly depoliticise and control the Palestinian population. In the long run, Arab normalisation with Israel without concessions on the Palestinian issue takes away the main Arab leverage to enforce a two-state solution, which could backfire.

A deeply weakened PA is likely to collapse and leave the administration of Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank to their occupier  Israel. Such a development would only further put to the fore the apartheid practices of the Israeli state, giving full rights to Israeli Jews, while oppressing and discriminating against the native Palestinian population.

This would likely provide even more fuel into the transnational grassroots opposition to Israeli occupation and apartheid, which is already putting significant pressure on Israel to give the Palestinians their rights.

In this sense, the continuing denial of statehood to the Palestinians by the Israeli right-wing ruling elite and the collapsing support for Israel among younger generations of Americans and Western Europeans puts the country even more firmly on a path towards a one-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians would enjoy equal rights. This would effectively mean the end of the Zionist dream of a Jewish state on all of historic Palestine.

The current Israeli political leadership is too short-sighted to see these potential developments. Netanyahu is enjoying the image boost the normalisation deal gave him and is probably hoping this would secure his re-election once the ruling coalition collapses and allow him to continue dodging jail over the corruption crimes he is being tried for. His premiership may well go down in history as the one that laid the groundwork for the end of the exclusive Jewish state in Palestine.

Thus, what may seem like a major loss for the Palestinian cause may turn out to be more harmful for the Zionist project. Sooner or later, the Israelis will have to face to consequences of denying Palestinian statehood.",nam
440,"Slipping a $20 bill to the woman at the DMV might seem like a weird idea to you. Average people in the United States dont tend to bribe their police officers or doctors. But worldwide, 27 percent of people say that they paid a bribe to get public services last year.

This statistic comes from Transparency Internationals annual Global Corruption Barometer report, which surveyed people around the world about corruption. In some places, like Liberia and Sierra Leone, over 75 percent of people reported paying a bribe.

Even in the United States, 36 percent of respondents say that the level of corruption has increased a lot over the past two years. They pointed the finger largely at political parties76 percent of people in the United States said that political parties were affected by corruption.

To get these numbers, Transparency International surveyed about 1,000 people from each of the 107 countries they looked at. Thats less than one percent of the population of most of these countries, and some of the questions on the survey might be seen as leading. (To what extent is this countrys government run by a few big entities acting in their own best interest?)

Still, the survey included some interesting stories of corruption. A woman in Venezuela had to bribe police to release her son who they had beaten and taken away for no reason. In Nepal, local officials made a list of fake mothers, to pocket money that was meant for women to give birth in hospitals rather than at home.

The survey didnt just look at small bribes passed by hand between people either. It also looked a political bribes, parliamentary bribes, media bribes and medical bribes. The BBC writes:

It is political parties, the driving force of democracies, as TI calls them, which are perceived to be the most corrupt public institution.

That is, in large part, because corruption is not just about bribery. Almost two out of three people say they believe personal relationships are what help get things done in the public sector  one in two say their government is largely or completely run by special interest groups.

Corruption is, as the report suggests, a global problem, and one that isnt going away. Very few people thought that their country was getting less corrupt. And while 9 out of 10 people in the survey say they want to act against corruption, many also reported that they felt they had no choice but to pay the bribes demanded of them.",nam

443,"KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2  Life was fine for veteran banker Datuk Seri Nazir Razak until one of his banker friends advised him to buy an insurance policy in October 2018 while he was in the UK.

In doing so, he was required to undergo a health screening as part of the procedure.

The basic health check-up then led to a shocking discovery which turned Nazirs life around.

I took a blood test and it was discovered that I had a high prostate-specific antigen score, which suggested that there might be a problem.

Nazir was then advised by the doctor to go for further investigative screenings to get a conclusive result.

He then went for an MRI test and a biopsy over the next few months where he was diagnosed not only with prostate cancer, but it was discovered that its an aggressive one.

It was a scary discovery as I had an aggressive prostate cancer and absolutely no symptoms, he said.

To determine the aggressiveness of the disease, Nazir did a Gleason score assessment and discovered that his score stood at nine out of 10, which is considered highly aggressive.

He was then told not to waste any time and go for the surgery as soon as possible.

Nazir went for the surgery on February 5 last year to remove his prostate using robotic prostatectomy procedure.

This is where the surgeon sits at a control panel in the operating room and moves robotic arms to operate through several small incisions in the patients abdomen.

Nazir, who describes himself as a glass-half-full person, said although he was shocked by the discovery, he remained optimistic to recover from the disease as he was lucky enough to catch it at an early stage.

The key to survival for prostate cancer patients is to catch it early and treat it before it escapes the prostate.

He also admitted that he was fortunate enough to have a good support system  his wife, children and friends, who kept him upbeat to fight the disease.

They kept being very positive although they may have had different thoughts themselves.

He added that his wife, Datin Seri Azlina Aziz was very good in a crisis and helped him stay focused throughout the treatment.

Following the surgery, Nazir recalled that he went through a smooth recovery process for a few months before he returned to normalcy.

Prostate cancer is not something to panic about. Those who go through it should remain calm so that they can make the right decision.

According to the latest Malaysian National Cancer Registry Report 2012-2016 which was published last year, a total of 4,189 cases of prostate cancer were registered from the same period when compared with 3,132 cases between 2007 and 2011.

Of the reported cases, 68.6 per cent were detected at a late stage (III and IV), which was higher when compared to 2007-2011 report (60 per cent).

The report also highlighted prostate cancer as seventh most common cancer in Malaysia and third in males.

Road to recovery

Although the road to recovery was quite smooth for Nazir, the cancer experience was nothing short of a big lesson which changed his life priorities.

One of the things I realised was that in my younger days I didnt have the right work-life balance, he said.

He recalled that he was very consumed by CIMB during his tenure as the chief executive officer and the group chairman with long working hours and a very little break.

At the end of the day, work is important but its not everything.

There is no point having all the money in the world if you dont have a healthy body, he said.

If he could reverse the time and do it all over again, Nazir said he would have chosen to be more disciplined and focus more on his personal life.

However, he now lives a healthy lifestyle by exercising, watching his food and going for regular health check-ups.

But the biggest change for me is that I quit smoking, he said with a big smile.

A new adventure

Moving forward, Nazir has taken one of his lifes challenges and is turning it into meaningful advocacy by sharing his experience to help his fellow countrymen gain more knowledge about prostate cancer.

The 53-year-old cancer survivor has teamed up with the Universiti Malayas Urological Cancer Trust Fund to run a five-year nationwide campaign dubbed #onlymencan.

The idea came after Nazir realised there was a lack of awareness about prostate cancer in Malaysia.

After he returned home, Nazir met the committee at the trust fund to think of ways to give back to society.

However, he learned that there were capacity limitations when it came to having enough funds to run any sorts of awareness campaigns.

He then went on to raise a minimum of RM5 million from various foundations within his corporate network to fund his five-year campaign.

The first leg of his campaign, which takes place throughout November, will focus on educating people about prostate cancer and emphasising on the importance of early detection.

Citing recent studies he said late diagnosis among Malaysians is much higher than neighbouring Singapore (25 to 30 per cent) and the United States (less than 20 per cent).

As such he said the ultimate goal of the campaign would be to lower the number of newly-diagnosed advanced prostate cancer from the current 60 per cent to 30 per cent by 2025.

To better understand the general sentiment about prostate cancer in Malaysia, Nazir said they conducted a baseline study and interviews.

As a result, they found out that 15 per cent of Malaysians think women have a prostate, while 50 per cent think prostate cancer is something to do with urination.

The level of understanding and awareness about prostate is very limited.

We also noted that culturally people are reluctant to discuss prostate, simply because of the nature of the topic.

Nazir also pointed out that many people may have symptoms such as urinary incontinence or impaired sexual functions but they tend to ignore it simply because they are shy to talk about it.

Apart from educating the society at large about prostate cancer, Nazir said his campaign will also focus on training general practitioners on how to deal with prostate cancer patients.

The campaign will be led by infectious diseases expert and UM medical faculty dean Prof Datuk Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman.

It will also include urology experts Prof Dr Ong Teng Aik and Prof Dr George Lee Eng Geap as well as prostate cancer survivors and key opinion leaders.

When asked why he decided to share his story publicly, Nazir quickly said he wanted to save lives and prevent people from going through pains by encouraging them to do regular screenings.

He also noted that after he opened up about his experience, many of his friends were encouraged to get checked.

Every man has a 10 per cent chance of getting prostate cancer. The key to survival is early detection.

He, however, agreed that many people are reluctant to go for regular screenings due to the fear of being diagnosed with a disease.

I always tell them its not just about you; its about your family and the people around you.

I just want everyone to know that in the case of prostate cancer, the chances of survival depends on how early you catch the disease.

Get checked, detect it early and youll be able to survive and thrive, he added.

Nazir is the youngest son of Malaysias second prime minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein and also the younger brother of former premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak.

While growing up, Nazir was sent to the UK at the age of 13 to pursue his undergraduate and post-graduate studies in the 80s.

It was there he met Azlina and they both are blessed with twins  a boy and a girl  who both are pursuing their masters in the UK at the moment.

Nazir is a well-known figure in Malaysia for his integral role in shaping and transforming CIMB Group Holdings Berhad into a leading regional financial group it is today.

He spent nearly three decades at the banking group, where he served as a group chief executive officer for 15 years and group chairman for four years before stepping down in 2018.

Despite leaving a legacy behind for turning CIMB Group completely around, Nazir said his venture into banking after he returned from the UK was totally accidental.

I was initially planning to go into civil service as my late father thought one of us (the brothers) should do that.

But Malaysia had changed when I came back and I was advised to enter the corporate sector.

He said he was advised to go into banking as a stepping stone to corporate life.

Nazir then jokingly said as it turned out, his adventure in banking was never a stepping stone as he remained in the industry for 29 years.

Following his resignation, Nazir still has a hand in a few businesses including furniture and food.

He also has a private entity firm in Singapore and does bits and bobs in Malaysia.
