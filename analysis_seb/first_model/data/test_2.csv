650,"The fintech Modulr has today launched Confirmation of Payee, a fraud prevention initiative spearheaded by Pay.UK, it is officially the first non-bank or building society to do so.

The feature provides an extra layer of defence to protect Modulrâs customers from malicious redirect payment fraud, also known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud. This is the second Modulr product launch to come out of its Â£10m grant from the Capability and Innovation Fund (CIF) under the RBS Alternative Remedies package. Modulr, an authorised electronic money institution, is the first non-bank or building society to join Confirmation of Payee after the mandated institutions.

APP fraud describes when a person is tricked into approving a payment to a fraudsterâs account, through social engineering, manipulation or deceit. These scams cost businesses and consumers millions every year â and thereâs often little recourse to get back stolen money.

Thatâs because with push payments, users enter the beneficiaryâs details and thereâs an assumption of trust before the payment is made â as opposed to pull payments such as card-present payments where the user is generally protected by chargeback rights, or Direct Debits.

With Confirmation of Payee, Modulrâs customers will have greater assurance their payments are going to the right recipient when theyâre paying a business or personal account. Confirmation of Payee calls on Modulrâs API and automatically checks that the recipientâs name and account details match the information held by their payment service provider.

If the details donât match, the user will be warned so they can confirm the details with the person or organisation theyâre trying to pay. Not only does this help protect against fraud, it also helps to avoid simple mistakes like accidentally mistyping account details when setting up a beneficiary.

The benefits for businesses will be significant. Confirmation of Payee can dramatically reduce the risk of direct financial losses incurred by fraud. It can also save operational costs by reducing the number of payments that need to be investigated or recalled.

Confirmation of Payee will be a powerful tool in industries such as lending. Lenders often rely on bank validation tools to protect themselves against fraud â but these are expensive, can become outdated, and are easy for fraudsters to opt-out of. Confirmation of Payee provides a much more reliable and cost-effective alternative, as it draws on the payeeâs bank data in real-time.

Confirmation of Payee will also have a strong impact in the alternative banking sector. Neobanks are fighting two battles when it comes to fraud â they must protect their customers from becoming victims of scams and prevent customers from using their accounts to commit fraud. CoP can help to fight back against both, protecting the reputation of neobanks and their customers.

Myles Stephenson, Chief Executive and founder of Modulr, says: âWeâre committed to delivering the very latest innovation in payments to our customers, and Iâm delighted that we are the first non-bank or building society to offer Confirmation of Payee. Thousands of consumers and businesses fall victim to social engineering scams every year in the UK. Modulr is always looking for ways to help our customers keep their money safe.

âWeâre pleased to announce the launch of Confirmation of Payee offers greater assurance to businesses and consumers when making payments. This is a crucial step forward in the ongoing battle against fraud and itâs going to help us build a safer payments ecosystem in the UK.â

Brian Cunnington, SME for the CoP project team, Pay.UK says: âWe are delighted to see Confirmation of Payee now making a difference in the UK payments environment. The new service offers protection for consumers through the account name checking service, reducing errors and fraudulent misdirection of funds.â",0

German police are investigating a ""probable terrorist attack"" after a man ploughed a lorry into a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.

The driver, a Pakistani asylum seeker who entered Germany last year, is being questioned.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be ""particularly sickening"" if he were proven to be a refugee.

He was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terror links.

German media say police have searched a refugee shelter at a defunct Berlin airport where the suspect was believed to be staying.

Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man was probably from Pakistan, and that his application for asylum had not yet been processed.

The suspect denies involvement, Mr de Maiziere said.

Berlin attack: What we know

""We have to assume this was a terrorist attack"", Mrs Merkel said in a short statement on Tuesday.

Those behind the attack would be punished ""as harshly as the law allows"", she added.

What happened?

The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in Berlin's west.

The attack happened in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which was damaged in a World War Two bombing raid and preserved as a symbol of peace.

The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), one of its busiest times. It crashed through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.

The DPA news agency said police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area.

What do we know about the suspect?

German media have identified the suspect, citing security sources, as a 23-year-old Pakistani named Naved B who entered the country in either late 2015 or early 2016.

Reports said special forces had stormed a hangar at Berlin's Tempelhof airport where they believed the suspect had been living in a shelter before the attack.

Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said he was seized after leaving the lorry and fleeing on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.

A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.

Where did the lorry come from?

Police said a Polish man, believed to be the original driver, had been found dead on the passenger seat.

Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.

""We don't know what happened to him,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him.""

The truck was registered in Poland, but it is unclear whether it was travelling from Poland or returning from Italy, as some reports suggest.

How has Germany reacted?

Chancellor Merkel said she was ""shocked and very saddened"" by the attack but added ""we don't want to live with fear of evil"".

Germany's interior ministry said Christmas markets in Berlin would remain closed on Tuesday but other markets outside of the capital will operate as normal.

A senior member of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Marcus Pretzell, blamed Mrs Merkel for the attack, linking it to her open-door migration policy which saw the arrival of more than one million people last year.

What do eyewitnesses say happened?

A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press that the 25-tonne lorry had missed him by only about three metres as it smashed through stands and knocked down a large Christmas tree.

""It was definitely deliberate,"" said the tourist.

He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands.

Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed ""blood and bodies everywhere"".

""I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed.

""I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there.""

'I heard the noise and the screams'

Is this the first such attack?

A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Ten people were killed and dozens more injured in separate gun, bomb, axe and machete attacks in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg in July.

A year of terror in Germany

But Monday's incident was reminiscent of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).

The mayor of Nice, Philippe Pradal, said the Berlin incident shared the same ""blind violence"" as the attack on his city.

Both IS and al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds.

The US labelled the tragedy an apparent ""terrorist attack"" and pledged its support.

President-elect Donald Trump blamed ""Islamist terrorists"" for a ""slaughter"" of Christians in the German capital.

""Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!"" he tweeted.

541,"(Yicai Global) June 3 -- GSX Techedu alleges that Grizzly Research fabricated data in a second report the activist short selling firm published about the Chinese online tutoring services provider, describing it as breaking the bottom line of business ethics, The Paper reported today.

GSX claims that the research report was awash with photoshopped images and unsubstantiated statements, The Paper said, citing the company. It added that the Beijing-based firm plans to seek help from Chinas public security bureaus economic crimes investigation unit.

GSX exaggerated its student numbers and operating revenue by around 900 percent and is also doing large-scale illegal marketing, Grizzly Research claimed in its report published yesterday. Actual student numbers in each class and revenue are available via the application program interface, or API, of its Gaotu 100, and its income calculated based on the actual number of students is far less than the figure in its financial report, the report said.

The API cannot reveal the complete data, and courses seen on the API are just those for sale at the moment, not including major courses in spring, GSX said, adding that the reports forecast on its revenue from Gaotu 100 in the second quarter was groundless.

A large amount of information tampering, digitally altered pictures and completely illogical allegations appeared in the report, GSX said. For example, the picture on the bottom left of page 16 shows that the birthdays of the 39 people listed are almost the same.

Many institutions have gone short on GSX this year. US-based Grizzly Research went short on the stock [NYSE: GSX] in February, saying the company had substantially overstated its profitability when applying to go public.

Since April, Citron Research has released three short-selling reports alleging that GSX had many fake accounts and undisclosed related transactions. But the firms shares gained 4.8 percent over the previous trading day after Citron Research issued its third report on May 7.

Muddy Waters Capital, a well-known short-selling agency that exposed Luckin Coffees financial fraud, also released a report on GSX on May 18, saying that some 80 percent of its users are bots.",1

335,"(CNN Business) John McAfee, the antivirus software magnate and former Libertarian presidential candidate, has been indicted for tax evasion.

McAfee allegedly failed to file his taxes for four years despite earning millions in income between 2014 and 2018 from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary, according to the indictment filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.

The indictment alleges that McAfee evaded taxes by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency accounts in the names of others, while also using the names of others to conceal ownership of property and assets including a yacht.

The amount McAfee owes was not specified in the indictment.

The June 15, 2020 indictment was unsealed following McAfee's arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition, prosecutors said.

According to an attachment to the indictment, if convicted, McAfee faces a maximum of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum of one year for each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and over $350,000 in monetary penalties, according to the indictment.

The cybersecurity tycoon was also hit with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, accusing him of making millions by recommending several cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Twitter without disclosing that he was being paid to promote them by the companies issuing the offerings.

He also ""falsely claimed to be an investor and/or a technical advisor when he recommended several ICOs,"" the SEC said in its complaint. The SEC alleges this gave the impression that he had vetted the companies involved and that he was willing to invest his own money in them.

""In reality, McAfee's tweets were paid promotions disguised as impartial investment advice,"" the complaint added.

The SEC said McAfee made more than $23 million from his recommendations, which the agency labeled as ""materially false and misleading for several reasons.""",1

The Hollywood producer Riza Aziz, stepson of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Mr Aziz, who produced The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was detained in Malaysia and bailed.

US prosecutors have accused Mr Aziz's production company of misappropriating money from a multi-billion dollar state fund to finance the film.

Mr Aziz's stepfather and mother have both been charged with corruption.

Mr Aziz will appear in court on Friday to face charges, said Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia's anti-corruption agency.

He has denied any wrongdoing. His production company, Red Granite, has already settled a civil lawsuit with the US government.

1MDB: The United States v The Wolf of Wall Street

Mr Najib faces more than 40 charges and is accused of pocketing $681m (Â£540m) from the state fund 1MDB, short for 1Malaysia Development Berhad. His wife Rosmah Mansor has been charged with money-laundering and tax evasion.

Both have pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors have said the money was used to fund an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. Raids on properties linked to Mr Najib after he was toppled from power in May 2018 uncovered luxury goods worth millions of dollars.

Mr Aziz was also questioned last year over allegations of theft and money-laundering.

DiCaprio won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor for The Wolf of Wall Street and thanked Mr Aziz in his acceptance speech.

The US Justice Department has also accused Red Granite Pictures of using 1MDB funds to produce the films Dumb and Dumber To and Daddy's Home. The company denies any wrongdoing.

In May, about $57 million was forfeited by the company and put into an account in Malaysia set up to recoup funds allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB.",1
285,"John McAfee, the controversial founder of the anti-virus company that carries his name, was arrested on Saturday at Barcelonaâs El Prat airport due to allegations of, among other offenses, evading millions of dollars of taxes on supposed income from activities such as promoting cryptocurrencies.

The United States Department of Justice announced on Monday all of the charges that McAfee is facing, and explained that they are awaiting for the extradition process from Spain to be completed, according to British daily the Financial Times, and which was later confirmed to EL PAÃS by sources from the Spanish High Court, the Audiencia Nacional. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also leveled accusations against McAfee in a civil court.

The eccentric millionaire was apprehended at the Spanish airport at 9.30am when he was due to take a flight to Istanbul, according to police sources. When his passport details were checked, officers discovered that there was an international warrant out for his arrest on accusations of fraud. He was arrested on the spot.

On Sunday, McAfee was brought before a court and was questioned by a judge via videoconference. When the testimony concluded, the magistrate ordered him to be held in custody while his extradition order was processed. The entrepreneur is currently being held in Brians prison, in Sant Esteve Sesrovire, Barcelona.

The American businessman is accused of hiding millions of dollars of income from US tax authorities for the promotion of cryptocurrencies and the sale of the rights to his life story, the Financial Times reported. Public prosecutors believe that the businessman used accounts in other peopleâs names to hide this income, which was obtained between 2014 and 2018. The US authorities also accuse him of acquiring assets, including a yacht, using other peopleâs names.

Since McAfee sold his antivirus company to Intel for â¬6.5 billion at the start of the previous decade, he has had a number of run-ins with the law. In 2012, he fled from the authorities after the death of his neighbor in Belize. He took refuge in neighboring Guatemala and was later deported to the US, although he was never charged in relation to the case.

In 2019, McAfee himself announced that he had fled the United States because he was facing accusations from the public prosecutor. Last year, speaking to a news agency from Cuba, he stated that he had not paid taxes for the last eight years. âI have not paid taxes for eight years. I will not pay taxes again â it is unconstitutional and illegal,â he said. He was also arrested in July 2019 in Dominican Republic for carrying weapons on his yacht.

According to the Department of Justice, he did not pay taxes for five years, between 2014 and 2018. The investigation was opened in June, but had remained sealed until his arrest. The SEC has brought civil charges against McAfee, saying he has promoted the purchase of cryptocurrencies among his followers on Twitter without warning that he was being paid for that promotion. According to the market watchdog, he was paid more than â¬19.5 million for the tweets. His bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, is also being investigated. If convicted of all charges, McAfee could face up to 30 years in prison, British daily The Independent reported.

Last March, when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, McAfee found himself in Tarragona, Spain, from where he began chronicling his experiences under the strict lockdown implemented in the country, complaining that the restrictions on mobility prevented him from doing what he wanted. He spoke about âmartial lawâ and also complained about the alarmism about a virus that, he claimed, killed fewer people than the ordinary flu. He published a series of videos in which he could be clearly seen ignoring Spainâs lockdown rules.",1
496,"The UKs financial regulator has fined Commerzbank £38m for money-laundering failures, including an out-of-control system for checking clients.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the German business bank had failed to put money-laundering controls in place over a period of five years, despite three separate warnings from the regulator.

The fine is one of the largest handed out by the regulator in relation to money-laundering failures. Standard Chartered was fined £102m by the FCA in April 2019 for similar issues, although that was dwarfed by the $1.1bn penalty levied on the same bank by US authorities.

Commerzbank London qualified for a 30% discount on the fine because it agreed to cooperate. The full fine would have been £54m.

Due diligence checks on more than 1,700 clients of Commerzbanks London office were overdue by 2017, when the regulator took action.

Some of these customers were able to carry on transactions with the bank despite the checks not having been completed because of an out-of-control system of exceptions, the FCA said.

The bank also failed to fix an automated tool for monitoring money-laundering risks. The FCA said Commerzbank London in 2015 found that 40 high-risk countries were missing from the tool, and 1,110 high-risk clients had not been added.

Commerzbanks policies and procedures for customer due diligence were found to be inadequate.

Mark Steward, the FCAs executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: Commerzbank Londons failings over several years created a significant risk that financial and other crime might be undetected. Firms should recognise that [anti-money laundering] controls are vitally important to the integrity of the UK financial system.

The bank has been forced to carry out a significant remediation exercise to put the processes in place, as well as appointing a senior executive to test it.

The fine will add to financial pressure on Commerzbank, which hopes to cut costs after sustaining a 227m (£203m) loss before tax in the first three months of 2020.

A spokeswoman for the bank said the FCA had found no financial crime during its investigations. Commerzbank has cooperated fully with the Financial Conduct Authority to mitigate any potential compliance risks promptly and appropriately, she said.

The FCA investigation relates to the time period of October 2012 to September 2017. The bank has successfully remediated and addressed the deficiencies that were the subject of the investigation.",1
1003,"About 30 fighters were killed in violent clashes between the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and Daesh, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported yesterday.

The two sides have been fighting continuously since the beginning of the month in separate axes in the Syrian desert.

The SOHR stated that the battles are concentrated in the Ithria area in the north-eastern suburbs of Hama and other areas linking the governorates of Aleppo, Raqqa and Hama, where the Syrian army, with the support of Russian air forces, are trying to repel continuous Daesh attacks.

The clashes resulted in the death of 13 Daesh members and 16 SAA soldiers, in addition to a number of regime loyalists.

Though Daesh has largely been defeated in Syria, sleeper cells and small groups of fighters remain in the country and often target oil fields and gas installations.

369,"Notorious warlord and world-renowned terrorist Gulbuddin Hikmatyar announced his candidacy for the Afghan presidential election on Saturday, presenting President Ghani with yet another challenge upon his return from his Taliban-imposed exile after twenty years. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar led a faction of the mujahedeen against the Russians during the invasion of the 1990s, and until 2016, he remained isolated from Afghan politics.

Hikmatyar announced his decision amidst pledges to restore stability and peace and accused the Ghani-led government of failing to reign in the Taliban. At a news conference held in Kabul, Hekmatyar said, Our countrys situation requires a powerful central government led by an elected president supported by the majority of people.

This sudden decision is undoubtedly a grave challenge for the already cornered Ghani, and analysts regard it as the warlords ploy to politically validate his party, the Hizb-i-Islami.

The Afghan President granted Hikmatyar immunity in 2016 after signing a peace deal; a decision that Washington also accepted. However, Hekmatyar continues to criticize the governance of Ghani, along with the legitimacy of the parliamentary election process back in October. While President Ghani has set his ambitions on a second term, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is not the only challenger to the throne.

On Friday, Mohammad Hanif Atmar former National Directorate of Security (NDS) adviser who bid goodbye to the government back in August has emerged as the most powerful challenger to Ghani. Atmar has pledged to save the country from the maladministration of the Ghani-led government.

Atmar is an addition to the list of names who have formally joined the presidential race, including former chief of intelligence, Rahmatullah Nabil. Zalmai Rassoul, the former foreign minister, who emerged third in the controversial elections of 2014, has also announced his decision to join the race. Lastly, Shaida Abdali, a former diplomatic aide to former President Hamid Karzai, will also be competing in the election.

Given the deadlock that has emerged in the negotiations between the Taliban and the US diplomatic mission, analysts are entertaining the possibility of a delay in the election. Experts have also noted that the peace negotiations might end up in a settlement that allows the Taliban a role of governance in the future.

The Afghan elections scheduled for July this year are circled with challenges, as Taliban control major areas of the country, security is the greatest concern. Moreover, the challenges and public at large are afraid that fraudulence will undermine the sanctity of the vote, as the 2014 election was widely accused of being mismanaged and heavily rigged.

Mohammad Yousef Rashid, the chief executive of the Institute of Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan has commented on the integrity of the Afghan election commission by highlighting the chaotic manner in which Afghan elections are conducted and stressing the need for powerful reforms to avoid a turmoil in July.

Rashid pointed out the failings of the current commissioners and their inability to lead the Afghan elections, along with citing the major problem of corruption and fraud. He admitted that the parliamentary election was marked with fraudulence, and said, If we dont solve these issues, once again the presidential election will be like a business.

The July race appears to have pitted Ghani against many of its arch rivals and critics, and the emergence of powerful challengers is revealing the dynamics of shifting loyalties. Needless to say, the elections will be a severe challenge for the election commission that has been heavily criticized for its inability to provide Afghanistan a fair and just parliamentary election back in October.",0

A milkman has been sentenced after bags of cash totalling Â£180,000 were found stashed in a secret compartment of his car.

Daniel Brown was arrested in February 2018 but told officers had no idea what was in the bags, Manchester Crown Court heard.

The 45-year-old, of Mulberry Close, Ormskirk, later pleaded guilty to possessing criminal property.

He received a 16-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

A search of his car as part of an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) recovered bags of cash and a mobile phone, the court was told.

'Murky world'

The milkman told the court he was asked to do a cash-in-hand delivery job, he told officers.

Because he had money problems, and was desperate, he agreed.

Maqsood Khan, of the Crown Prosecution Service's Fraud Unit said the defendant had ""dipped his toe into the murky world of organised crime and is paying the price.

""The bottom line is, a man of previous good character has been caught breaking the law in a very serious way.""",1
266,"The man convicted in the murder of Buffalo native John Granville has been designated a terrorist by the United States government.

U.S. Attorney William Hochul Jr. confirmed that the U.S. State Department has issued the designation for Abd Al-RaâOuf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza under Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.

Hamza and three co-conspirators participated in an armed attack in Khartoum, Sudan on January 1, 2008 which led to the death of Granville, who was serving as a U.S. Diplomat at the time. He was working on democracy and governance programs while serving with the U.S. Agency for International Development. A U.S. Embassy staff member was also killed in the attack.

âAs the office that is leading the criminal investigation into this terrible crime, this is certainly welcome news,â Hochul said, of the designation. âThis action puts the world on notice that anyone aiding this individual will, along with the defendant, eventually be brought to justice.â

The decision to issue the terrorist designation means two things. First, all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hamza has any interest is blocked and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Additionally, American citizens are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with a designated terrorist.

Hamza and his co-conspirators were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Sudanese criminal court in 2009. All four escaped from a maximum security prison the following year, killing a Sudanese police officer during the escape. Hamza was eventually recaptured and is currently in prison in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.",1

Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.

The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.

Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue - billions of euros for the largest online firms.

But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.

The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.

Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.

""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""

That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".

But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.

""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.

""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""

Incitement to hatred

France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.

But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.

France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.

Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.

That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment.

Failure to remove content could attract a fine of up to â¬1.25m (Â£1.1m).

France's regulator, the Superior Council of the Audiovisual (CSA), will have the power to impose heftier fines of up to 4% of global turnover for continuous and repeated violations.

Laetitia Avia, the MP from President Macron's LREM party who proposed the bill, said the law would protect victims, while reaffirming the country's commitment to freedom of expression.

However, France's Republicans party voted against the measure.

Member Constance Le Grip told the National Assembly that fighting online hatred could not come at the expense of freedom of expression.

Her colleague in the Senate Bruno Retailleau tweeted that the new law was ""incompatible with respect for public freedoms"".

Facebook said it was working closely with French regulator CSA and others ""on the implementation of this law"".

Twitter's head of public affairs in France, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, told Reuters that the company would continue to work with the government to fight illegal content and hate speech.",0

During a video released on Tuesday, the Attorney General of the Republic, Alejandro Gertz Manero, revealed the accusations by the former head of Mexican state oil firm Pemex, Emilio Lozoya, and said that his office was opening a case.

Loyoza said that he had allocated 100 million pesos he received from Brazilian construction company Odebretch to fund Nieto's campaign and to pay for foreign electoral advisers.

According to the allegations, Nieto and his Secretary of the Treasury, Luis Videgaray, instructed Lozoya to use 404 million pesos to buy the votes of senators and deputies. The goal was to win the support on a group of reforms carried during 2013 and 2014 named Pacto de Mexico.

Moreover, Loyoza said that he could present four witnesses, videos, and documents to back up his accusations. The former Pemex president remains in Mexico to face trial over a corruption case that involves the Odebrecht company.

Several Mexican lawmakers explain that if Enrique Peña Nieto is prosecuted for corruption and bribery, it would be the first time that a Mexican president goes to court over these charges.",1

Seven people were charged with laundering $2.1 million  including more than $300,000 in illegally obtained coronavirus relief money - through a North Carolina casino, officials announced.

Four Georgia residents and three South Carolinians were found with more than $2.1 million in illegal cash. They are accused of laundering at least $750,000, including over $350,000 through Harrah's Cherokee Hotel and Casino, the Department of Justice announced in an indictment unsealed in South Carolina on Thursday.

Investigators found the money included the proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan of more than $359,000, the indictment states.

The case started as a drug trafficking investigation, but federal agents began digging further.

Christopher J. Agard, one of the seven, used his business, Wild Stylz Entertainment LLC, to launder money from previous criminal activity unrelated to the PPP loans, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office in the District of South Carolina.

In October 2019, he and the six others are accused of depositing and then withdrawing illegally obtained money. Three of the suspects then converted $200,000 out of $378,000 in illegal cash to casino chips at Harrahs Cherokee Casino and Resort, the indictment states.

After gambling for less than two hours, [they] cashed out from the casino and left with approximately $198,750 in cash, court papers state.

When the two suspects returned to Harrahs three days later and each tried to cash $50,000 checks, casino officials grew suspicious, according to the indictment.

A Harrahs spokesperson told Fox News the casino operates under a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program.

The program takes ""measures to prevent its casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity, spokesperson Brian Saunooke said in an email.

Months later, in May 2020, Agard applied for and received a PPP loan using bogus supporting documents connected to Wild Stylz, authorities said. He was awarded more than $395,000, but then disseminated the fraudulently obtained funds to other members of the conspiracy through various means.

Federal agents have seized more than $2.1 million in illegally-obtained funds from 12 different banks, the DOJ said. Each of the seven people was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.",1
232,"A Houston tech executive was charged on Thursday with hiding $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service in what federal prosecutors called the largest tax evasion case in U.S. history.

Prosecutors said the executive, Robert T. Brockman, had used a web of entities based in Bermuda and Nevis, as well as secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland, to hide income from the I.R.S. that he had earned on private equity investments over 20 years.

A 39-count federal indictment handed up by a grand jury in San Francisco detailed a complex scheme involving backdated records and encrypted communications with code names like âKing,â âBonefishâ and âSnapperâ as well as âthe house,â for the I.R.S.

The indictment said that Mr. Brockman, the chief executive of Reynolds and Reynolds, an Ohio company that makes management software for auto dealerships, used $30 million in income that he had hidden from taxation to buy properties named Mountain Queen and Frying Pan Canyon Ranch in Colorado and had spent an additional $29 million in unreported income on a yacht named Turmoil.",1

The Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee was swimming in cash, and by the time the festivities had ended, it had raised over $107 millionâfar more than any other presidential inaugural in history. But it also spent extravagantly, and according to documents recently revealed as part of a lawsuit, staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with themâmuch of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

The records made public as part of the lawsuit reveal that there was a real lack of separation between the Trumps as business owners and the Trumps as the incoming first family. Shortly after the 2016 election, as the newly formed committee was scrambling to organize inaugural events, Rick Gates, the committeeâs deputy chair, received a quote from the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the cost of using the hotelâs ballroom. The price tag for the luxury DC establishment, housed in the historic Old Post Office building and owned and operated by the family of the president-elect was huge: $3.6 million for eight days of use, or $450,000 per day. Gates emailed Ivanka Trump, who owns a piece of the hotel, to raise his concerns.

Staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with themâmuch of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

âFirst, the cost itself seems quite high compared to other property buyouts for the week,â Gates wrote. âSecond, I am a bit worried about the optics of PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee] paying Trump Hotel a high fee and the media making a big story out of it.â

A few days later, Ivanka Trump told Gates that she had called the general manager of the property and the hotel came back to the inaugural committee with a new quoteâbetter, but still asking for $175,000 a day. That rate far exceeded the hotelâs own internal pricing guidelines, and it seems likely that Ivanka Trump, as a part-owner, knew that. (For comparison, the new court filing shows that another nonprofit paid just $5,000 to use part of the Trump Hotel ballroom for part of one of the days the Inaugural Committee had rented it, which matched the internal guidelines.)

At this point, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump who managed much of the inaugural planning, warned Ivanka Trump and Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision hereâaudits on what locations were used and how much was paid to use them would be made public. âI understand that compared to the original pricing this is great but we should look at the whole context,â Winston Wolkoff wrote, adding that she thought $85,000 a day was the most she considered to be reasonable.

Winston Wolkoffâs concerns were ignored. The Presidential Inaugural Committee ended up paying the Trump Hotel $1 million for four days use of the hotelâs ballroom.

They probably should have heeded Winston Wolkoffâs warnings. The lawsuit bringing these records to light was filed by Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, DC, against the Inaugural Committee and the Trump Organization. Racine is arguing that the district has the right to seek the repayment of funds because nonprofits operating in Washington, DC, which the Inaugural Committee did, may not work to create profits for a private organization or individual. According to Racine, the Inaugural Committee âcoordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel.â The attorney general is asking that the money be returned and given to charities that promote civic engagement. (Racine is also separately involved with one of the emoluments lawsuits against the president regarding the Trump Old Post Office hotel, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland.)

If the new lawsuit, which was filed this week, goes forward, it could release a further avalanche of details on how the most lavishly funded inaugural celebration frittered away tens of millions of dollarsâand more details about how involved the Trump family itself was in the decision-making.

Unsurprisingly, representatives of the inaugural committee issued a statement to the Washington Post insisting that there was no misconduct.

Racineâs lawsuit also highlights how negotiations between the inaugural committee and the hotel happened specifically in the context of profits for the hotel. In early January 2017, when the committee was considering pulling out of at least one event at the hotel, the hotelâs manager emailed Gates highlighting his concerns: âJust heard that the Friday night reception had been canceled. Is it accurate? Tough on us if it is as it was a lot of revenue for 1,250 people,â Mickael Damelincourt wrote. Gates continued the negotiation.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump, warned Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here. Her concerns were ignored.

Racineâs supporting documents also offer a sense of the (sometimes comical) internal decisions being made for the most expensive inaugural celebration ever, which featured sparse crowds and far fewer events than normal. (Lists of tasks for inaugural committee staff are included in the suit because of the explicit references in them to the negotiations over use of the hotel space.) For instance, there are repeated mentions of Trumpâs desire to arrive at a celebration on the mall in a military helicopter, flanked by members of the military. This idea was apparently nixed because at the time of the celebrations, Trump was not yet commander in chief. The documents also describe the president-electâs hopes for military helicopters and tanks to flank the stage at the outdoor celebration. Another note describes how Donald and Ivanka Trump jointly decided that the Beach Boys would not be performing. At one point, a to-do list item includes asking Melania Trump about a family-and-friends tea reception at the White House, followed by a note from an inaugural committee staffer, âThere should be NO reception.â Later, a more adamant note appeared: âConfirmed that NO tea will be hosted at WH and must be removed from schedule.â

Still, some of the most damning material revealed here has nothing to do with the Trump family and their over-the-top plans for the celebration. The documents repeatedly mention that inaugural committee staff should consult with Steve Wynn, the billionaire owner of Wynn Resorts who is a longtime GOP donor and personal friend of Donald Trump. The suggestions are highly specificâWynn directing that the song â40 Hours a Weekâ by the band Alabama be played at an inaugural event. In 2018, Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct, which led him to step down as CEO of his casino company and as a finance chair for the Republican National Committee.",1
90,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 6, ARMENPRESS. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on November 5 released data on the offshore activity of current or former leaders of famous companies and different countries of the world, reports Armenpress.

The materials, known as Paradise Papers, include over 13.4 million documents. They contain information on nearly 120 political figures, including Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, US President Donald Trump administration members, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

Erkam and Bulent Yildirim, sons of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, are also involved in the offshore scandal.

The materials published by the ICIJ state that the Yildirim brothers are sole shareholders of two companies registered in Malta. The first, Hawke Bay Marine Co. Ltd, was set up in April 2004. Public records suggest that the company owns or manages shipping vessels. The second, Black Eagle Marine Co. Ltd, was incorporated in January 2007. Records show that Erkam, who was the majority shareholder of the companies, is also the director of both. The companies were listed as active in the Malta Registry of Companies in October 2017.

Erkam and Bulent Yildirim, however, did not respond to a request for comment from ICIJ.",0

237,"Ukraineâs state intelligence agency announced on November 18 that it had detained a man wanted by Interpol for the high-profile murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov in Russia 13 years ago. Russiaâs Interior Ministry on November 20 named the suspect as Magomed Dukuzov and said that Ukrainian authorities had apprehended him at its request, according to Russian news agency TASS.

Klebnikov, a New Yorker of Russian descent, was working as editor of Forbesâ Russian edition when he was gunned down outside its Moscow office on the evening of July 9, 2004. He was 41. Klebnikovâs colleagues and Russian media reported at the time that the motive may have been the journalistâs work investigating Russiaâs often violent criminal underworld and shady dealings of some of its powerful business elite.

Contacted by CPJ via email on November 20, Klebnikovâs brother, Peter, responded to news of the arrest, saying, âThe issue is really who is the mastermind, and in identifying, investigating and finding him, the Russian government has failed completely. So this arrest, while important, is still a bit of a sideshow.â

When the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced the arrest in a statement, it alleged that the Russian national of Chechen origin âparticipated in a number of assassinations, in particular, the editor-in-chief of the Russian edition of Forbes and the deputy chairman of the apparatus of the government of the Chechen Republic in 2001-2003.â

The agency said that after fleeing Russia, the suspect, whom it did not identify, allegedly became involved in âan organized criminal group, which in Ukraine was engaged in extorting money from private entrepreneurs.â

The SBU said that it is conducting necessary procedures, including those related to extradition. But it remains unclear if or when Dukuzov could be returned to Russia. When reached by phone, the SBU in Kiev declined to comment, citing procedure and telling CPJ to send a written request. CPJ did not immediately receive a response to that request. Russiaâs Interior Ministry did not return CPJ calls or an emailed request.

But Russiaâs Interior Ministry did confirm the arrest in a statement given to the Interfax news agency, in which it said the Russian Prosecutor-Generalâs Office had also been notified of Dukuzovâs capture.

Since Klebnikovâs murder in 2004, little progress has been made in the case. Three people charged in Russia in 2006, including Dukuzovâs brother, Kazbek, were later acquitted. Russiaâs Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial for Kazbek Dukuzov, but he fled before the proceedings could be held, Forbes reported.

Russian authorities sought Magomed Dukuzov in connection with the murder, the state news agency ITAR-TASS reported at the time. But he was not apprehended until last week.

The Klebnikov family said in a statement in 2006 that it viewed the Supreme Court ruling as a âhopeful sign for justiceâ but it was disappointed that âPaulâs killers and those who ordered this vicious crime are still at large.â

Peter Klebnikov told CPJ, â[The family] continue to expect justice, and are willing to cooperate with the Russian authorities but have received virtually no communication from them in recent months.â

Kazbek Dukuzov is believed to be imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates for crimes unrelated to the killing of Klebnikov, according to a 2013 Forbes report. The same report said that Kazbek Dukuzov had been blacklisted by the U.S. under the Magnitsky Act, Ð° law meant to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses.

The Russian Prosecutor-Generalâs Office has alleged that Chechen separatist leader Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, a subject of a critical book published by Klebnikov in 2003, mastermind the journalistâs killing.

The U.S.-born Klebnikov, who was of Russian descent, moved to Moscow in 2004 to launch the Russian edition of Forbes magazine. The first edition hit newsstands in April 2004. Two-and-a half months later, Klebnikov was gunned down outside the Moscow office.

Klebnikov is one of 38 journalists murdered in direct retaliation for their work in Russia since 1992. Of those, 33 were killed with complete impunity, according to CPJ research.",1
1040,"COLUMBUS (AP)  Any potential comeback by ex-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder wont go unchallenged.

The once-powerful Republican said last week that unfinished business on policy matters has him considering a return run for the district including his Perry County home.

In a district where the winner of the Republican primary will almost certainly land the seat, a three-way GOP primary is shaping up. Coshocton City Council President Cliff Biggers is already running and a second GOP contender, local businessman Randal Almendinger, is circulating petitions.

Both Almendinger and Householder have until Dec. 16 to file.

High interest in the seat shows top Republicans arent clearing the way for Householders victory. Supporters have said Householder would bring valuable skill and experience to the Statehouse, but his detractors say he led an era of heavy-handed politics that shouldnt be repeated.

Householder, 56, left Columbus a decade ago amid a federal investigation into allegations of money laundering and irregular campaign practices.

An anonymous, nine-page memo leaked to the FBI, IRS and then-Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in 2004 accused the House Republican Campaign Committee that Householder oversaw of overpaying vendors, then having those vendors make secret payments back to Householder and his advisers.

Householder said at the time the memo contained half-truths and outright lies. After a two-year investigation, the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute.

If he runs, Householder would join a group of seasoned Republican lawmakers seeking to return to the House next year. They include Senate President Keith Faber and state Sens. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, Tom Patton of Cleveland, Jim Hughes of Columbus and possibly Chris Widener of Springfield.

All served under Householder when he was speaker, potentially giving him critical mass to seek another speakership. Householder insists hes not going for the job.

He is, however, working to line up support for getting back to the Statehouse. Powerful retired lobbyist John Mahaney, of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said he supports the effort.

Larry is a very hard-working, loyal guy. I thought he did a nice job as speaker, he said. His staff didnt do him any favors, but he himself certainly was four-square with me. His word was his bond, as I prided myself at having mine be over the years. Also, were a couple of hillbillies  him from Glenford, me from Zanesville  so we got along.

Mahaney noted some storied Ohio politicians  including late Republican Gov. James Rhodes and the late Democratic House Speaker Vern Riffe  hailed from Appalachia. But the district Householder is eyeing has been redrawn to be more urban and less rural since Householder last served, so its unclear whether it would be so easy to win.

Biggers, who is black, may attract campaign and financial help from his party since he would lend some desired diversity to the nearly all-white House Republican caucus. He is a retired police detective and pastor of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Coshocton.

Almendinger is a Republican party insider well-known in Licking County, where he owns newspapers, a commercial cleaning company and a real estate company and has served in public roles including school board and township trustee.

Householder has served as Perry County commissioner and auditor. He was speaker from 2001 to 2004.",0
858,"Vividly portrayed in films from The Godfather to The Sweeney, the idea of criminal enforcement using threats, intimidation, assault and murder has long been an established underworld practice.

Despite the widespread cultural fascination with this shadowy part of society, there is little in the way of academic work that explores the role of enforcers.

My latest research with colleagues from Scotland and the US consisted of interviewing underworld figures from two parts of the UK â the West Scotland and the West Midlands, to further explore the nature and extent of this phenomenon.

In popular culture, the criminal enforcer conjures up images of machismo, allure, brute force and professionalism. In the fictional world, enforcement activities like debt collecting or extortion seemingly take place within the night-time economy, in pubs, clubs and casinos.

Also in media portrayals in news and on television, the preferred mode of communication seems to be violence â a constant presence in organised crime. My previous research on organised crime argues that violence can be used strategically by a crime outfit to start, maintain or advance a criminal enterprise. But to what extent is this the case for enforcement out on the streets of our towns and cities?

Becoming an enforcer

The West of Scotland and West Midlands have long histories of organised crime â both places are major hubs for illicit drugs. Through a comparative study we gained extensive insights into a number of areas including how people become enforcers; how contact is made between all parties involved; the costing arrangements; and the degree of planning involved.

In the study, a criminal enforcer was defined as any member or associate of a criminal organisation who acts illegally to achieve his ends. Essentially the enforcer is someone who settles a dispute to get âjusticeâ for his employer, such as a debt that is owed.

Itâs 100% social. You need to have that name. Everybody needs to know that youâre the person who collects the debts. Often, you gain that criminal reputation and respect from the work that youâve put in, the prison time that youâve done.

This was a response from John, an ex-military private investigator, when asked whether strong social connections are required to be a successful enforcer. Social capital, according to John, underscores the saying: âItâs not what you know, itâs who you knowâ. So this view is not exclusive to the legitimate world and makes clear the importance of being known and being seen on the streets when it comes to underworld enterprises.

The economics of enforcement

Researchers who have explored the economics of crime and punishment tend to examine how offenders calculate things: the practicalities and money offered by a legal income; the income potential of illicit methods; the probability of being arrested for criminal behaviour and the likely punishment if convicted.

Aaron, who has previously worked as a debt collector for several crime groups, alludes to the good money that is associated with enforcement:

â¦ Sometimes the lender will tell you to get back his money and you will get a percentage. Iâve been involved in situations where individuals have had to pay back the money with interest. In these cases Iâve been told by the lender to take a percentage from the money heâs owed and whatever else heâs charged on top.

Interestingly, Aaron did not seem to factor in the probability of being arrested in his calculations. This should not be mistaken for foolishness, as enforcers are rational and sophisticated in their planning and carrying out of illegal work.

Planning and acting

Popular culture often portrays enforcement as a physically violent endeavour. According to Theo, a convicted offender, violence is not necessarily good for business:

Iâve been part of situations where itâs been a âcriminal figureâ who dealt with a legitimate company that owed him moneyâ¦ I didnât go in with tools [weapons]. Itâs because I was dealing with normal nine-to-five people, who would happily call the policeâ¦ Youâre better off reasoning with them and having a conversation.

Theoâs approach to violence is dependent on the circumstances of the debtor. Enforcement, in relation to debt collecting, is not a process that is exclusive to underworld operatives. His approach of âreasoningâ with normal everyday people (as opposed to other criminals) implies logic, which is much needed when retrieving owed money.

Overall, our study suggests that nuanced enforcement practices is an alternative form of criminal justice that is woven into the fabric of any provision of illicit goods or services. Yet, it is a criminal activity that is overlooked in national debates due to limited academic research.

Certain kinds of occupation often facilitate criminal behaviour like enforcing, such as a military background. Future research would help establish potential links between previous occupations and becoming involved in the enforcer business for organised crime, whether using lethal or non-lethal approaches. Clearly there is nuance there that is rarely explored in popular police and mafia dramas.",0
483,"According to Ripple, this lawsuit calls on the video platform to do a number of things.

It says: First, to be more aggressive and proactive in identifying these scams, before theyre posted. Second, faster removal of these scams once they are identified and lastly, to not profit from these scams.

As reported last month, Ripples CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter to warn users that a fake account was on YouTube and impersonating him with the promise of an XRP giveaway.

In this latest development, Garlinghouse is again out of justice on Twitter.

He comments: Across the industry, social media companies have failed to police their platforms from being abused by the entirely preventable imposter giveaway scams. Hundreds of people (including some of you) have been hurt, yet big tech continues to drag their feet.

Garlinghouse is not a happy chappy and calls YouTubes platform the epicentre for imposter scams and theyve done next to nothing in response to our constant takedown requests.

Its not just YouTube he rails against. Bizarrely, Instagram told him he wasnt being impersonated, despite clear evidence to the contrary.

In the official Ripple announcement, it asks for an industry wide-behaviour change and an expectation of accountability.

It also points out that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released COVID-19 scam reports, by the numbers. This publication shares that, as of 1 January, consumers reported financial losses of over $13M to COVID-19 related fraud.

In response to the XRP-specific giveaway scams and impersonations, Ripple says it hired an external cybersecurity and digital threat intelligence vendor to help with reporting and takedown efforts, in addition to building its own submission form for the community to report unusual activity.

Ripple does other things as well, but feels its fighting a losing battle and more needs to be done.

The firm concludes: For every scam, giveaway, fake conspiracy that is taken down, multiple more pop up nearly immediately. The reality is that big technology and media companies need to take responsibility and be held accountable for protecting consumers. This is a call to action.",1
59,"A reputed drug lord on the FBI's top 10 most-wanted list was captured in western Colombia, the interior minister said Monday, in a major blow to the country's largest remaining drug cartel.

Diego Montoya, who sits alongside Osama Bin Laden as the only major alleged drug trafficker on the FBI list, is accused of leading the Norte del Valle cartel and exporting tons of cocaine to the United States. The FBI had offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to his arrest.

The FBI says Montoya is sought ""in connection with the manufacture and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine."" It said the cartel is aided by left-wing rebels as well as right-wing paramilitaries.

Montoya's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, was captured by Colombia in January.

The Norte del Valle cartel became Colombia's most powerful after the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cartels in the 1980s and early 90s. Officials believe it is responsible for as much as 30 percent of the more than 550 tons of Colombian cocaine smuggled each year to the United States.

To protect its valuable drug routes, the cartel is believed to have worked closely with right-wing death squads whose umbrella organization, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, is listed as a terrorist organization by Washington.

Authorities have been closing in on the cartel since last year, when the army killed eight members of a private army believed to be protecting Diego Montoya.

A 2006 gunfight outside the Mi Casita psychiatric hospital left 11 Colombian police officers dead, and the police may have been acting on a tip that Montoya was hiding in the home, posing as a patient. There have been charges it was an ambush.

The Christian Science Monitor reports Montoya likes fast cars. Police in 2005 seized his personal mini racetrack last year, along with 74 ranches and eight houses. He is described as heavyset and gruff, and likes to be called ""El SeÃ±or de la Guerra (War).""

Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges. For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.

Most of those extradited have been low or midlevel drug traffickers. High-profile extraditions have included Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, brothers who helped found the Cali cartel.

Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States. Supply has remained robust despite record extraditions and eradication of coca crops.",1
334,"Masoud Dalvand (Freedom Star): In order to know more about the terrorist activities of the Iranian regime in the region of the Middle East and in the whole world, in addition to missile activities and support for militias and terrorist groups, the seemingly economic and commercial activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) must be carefully considered.

The IRGC intervenes like an octopus in all security, political, military, social, Internet and economic sectors, because it protects the dictatorship of the mullahs from overthrow by the Iranian people.

Most of the major oil and economic projects in Iran are under the control of this terrorist and corrupt force. Money from economic activities by the IRGC is spent on missile projects and the continuation of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the repression of uprisings of the Iranian people inside the country.

An important part of these funds is also paid to the accounts of the senior IRGC commanders because they are all corrupt and thieves. In one word, the IRGC is a corrupt mafia of assassinations and crimes in Iran, the Middle East and the entire world.

One of the companies owned by this terrorist force, is Mahan Air (an airlines company), which was recently banned by Germany and the United States. This so-called airline has its main task of sending weapons and militias and members of the IRGC to Syria to continue the war and protect the bloodthirsty dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.

The following article provides readers with information on this airline owned by the IRGCâs terrorist force. I invite you to read this article. Published on the official website of the Peopleâs Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK).

A look at Mahan Air, the IRGC-owned Iranian airline spreading death and destruction

Jan. 28, 2019 â Just a few days ago, Germany announced that Iranian airline Mahan Air is no longer allowed to enter German airspace. In response, the Iranian regimeâs minister of roads and urban development Mohammad Eslami said, âAll the companies and airline industry of the Islamic Republic are sanctioned, and Mahan Air is among them.â

On January 21, Reuters quoted German sources that Mahan Airâs license for flying to German has been canceled. According to Reuters, the German federal government cited âsafety problemsâ and the possibility of Iranian use of Mahan Air for âmilitary purposesâ as the reasons for its decision.

In a January 21 meeting between EU foreign ministers, German FM Heiko Maas said that Iranian Mahan Air transports weapons and soldiers to war-torn areas in Syria.

In a separate statement, German foreign ministry announced, âthis decision has been taken in light of the recent sanctions agreed upon by the EU Council after the [terroristic] developments in France and Denmark.â

In June last year, the Iranian intelligence ministry plotted a failed attempt to plant a bomb in a grand gathering by the Iranian Resistance. At least three Iranians were arrested in connection with the attack, one of them an Iranian diplomat named Asadollah Assadi, from the Iranian regimeâs embassy in Vienna, Austria.

Considering the recent developments, the foreign commission of the National Council of Resistance of Iran published a detailed report of Mahan Airs past record and its connections with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).

Mahan Air, while registered as a private company, has had vast links to the highest levels of Iranian officials from day one and has benefited a semi-official status of state-sponsorship throughout its life.

The Mola Almowaheddin institute, which describes itself as a charity, owns 100 percent of Mahan Airâs stock.

Mahan Air was founded in the city of Kerman, the capital of Kerman province in Iran. Mahan is the name of a small city 35 kilometers from Kerman. Ataâollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture and guidance during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, chose the name for Mahan Air.

Mahan Air was founded shortly after the Quds Force, IRGCâs foreign terrorist arm, was established.

Virtually all Mahan Airâs decision makers and major players are members of the IRGC and commanders of Qassem Soleimaniâs Quds Force. A short list of some of them follows:

Hamid Arabnejad, chairman and CEO of Mahan Air, is a very close friend to Qassem Soleimani
Hamid Aslani, currently advisor to Hamid Arabnejad, is a Brigadier general of the IRGC. He is a former member of IRGCâs SWAT teams and later became head of the human resources in IRGC. At the same time, he became the HR head of Mahan Air.
Hamid Asgari, heads Mahan Airâs catering through a company named Arman. Formerly, he was one of the commanders of IRGCâs 41 st division, known as the Tharallah Division. He is close to Qassem Soleimani.

Through connections in the highest levels of Iraqâs government, particularly Hadi Al-Amiri, former Iraqi minister of transportation and head of the Badr Organization, Qassem Soleimani organized Mahan Airâs flights over Iraqi airspace to transport weapons and equipment to Syria.

On a daily basis, Mahan Air conducts flights from Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Abadan to Damascus over Iraq to transport weapons, equipment and fighters to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

In groups of approximately 200 individuals each, Mahan Air transports militias, including Afghan nationals who have been hired by IRGC, to Damascus.

Iraqi militias affiliated with the Quds Force, are transported from Iraqâs Basra to Iranâs Abadan by bus, and from there flown to Damascus by Mahan Air.",1
607,"In 2010, New Delhi witnessed the Commonwealth Games (CWG) scam, one of the major Indian scams, involving a pilferage of around Rs 70,000 crore. It was estimated that only half of the allotted amount was spent on Indian sportspersons. The athletes were allegedly asked to shift to shabby apartments from the ones that were allotted to them by the authorities. Reports of the Central Vigilance Commission, in-charge of investigation of the CWG scam, revealed that Suresh Kalmadi, the Chairman of the organising committee of the Games, offered a contract of Rs 141 crore to Swiss Timings for its timing equipment which was unnecessarily high by Rs 95 crore. All the accused, including Kalmadi, were charged of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery for purpose of cheating and were also charged under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Introduced back in 1930, Commonwealth Games is an internationally popular multi-sport event that engages athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event takes place every four years and is conducted by Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF).",1
777,"It is one of the most prolific crimes on Earth, affecting almost 25 million men, women and children.

But human trafficking â the modern slave trade of living and breathing people for commercial gain â isnât occurring on some distant, dusty and lawless shore.

From domestic servitude, forced labour and forced marriage to sexual exploitation and the commercial trade in human organs, such harrowing practices steal through every nation on Earth, the UK included.

The proceeds of these crimes are the subject of intense focus by law enforcement around the world, in a bid to tackle such activities.

In the UK, specialists in a third of banks and other consumer-facing financial institutions have admitted that human trafficking already accounts for significant financial losses. Half have had to investigate criminal activity linked to human trafficking among their own customer transactions.

These businesses are obliged by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to have systems and controls in place to counter the risk that they are misused for the purposes of financial crime of all types, including human trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds.

As part of their legal obligations, financial organisations must identify customers using their services, take steps to monitor the transactions to detect those which are suspicious, and report their suspicions to the National Crime Agency (NCA).

âTraditional detection of money laundering focuses on the rapid movement of funds through accounts, discrepancies between the stated intended use (or account type) and actual usage, along with other obvious red flags,â says Rob Horton, head of financial crime solutions at BAE Systems.

As criminals evolve their techniques to evade controls, so the financial services industry must also innovate. Many of the leading banks are now applying advanced analytics to look across multiple sources of data to indicate suspected human trafficking in the underlying financial data.

That could include, for example, studying the transactional behaviour of large numbers of cash deposits as the victimsâ identities are often used to facilitate money laundering.

âWhen combined with profiling the financial transactions and online banking behaviour of these accounts, an accurate picture can be built to undercover criminal networks. There is also a human element,â Horton continues.

âNowadays branch staff are trained to spot potential âat riskâ customers, especially in the presence of further suspicion, for example visitors to the bank who are accompanied by a suspicious or controlling character.â

Anyone working in the regulated sector is required under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism Acts to submit suspicious activity reports (SARs) to the UK authorities if they know or even suspect that a person is engaged in or attempting money laundering.

Made by financial institutions and other professionals such as solicitors, accountants and estate agents, they provide intelligence from the private sector on a wide range of criminal activity, including economic crime that would otherwise not be visible to law enforcement.

SARs arenât crime reports, they are designed to flag a possible concern in case law enforcement agencies shares those concerns.

Each year, UK banks and building societies identify 20 million alerts of possible suspicious activity, investigate them, and then submit more than 400,000 SARs. Some involve a couple of hoursâ work, others take days or weeks before the firm can decide if the reporting threshold of âsuspicionâ has been reached.

Some firms also work closely with charities like Stop the Traffik to help identify and tackle human trafficking.

But a study of hundreds of professionals working in anti-money laundering, risk and fraud roles across financial, business, banking and insurance industries reveals shocking gaps in their capabilities.

More than 80 per cent are concerned that money laundering is currently happening in their customersâ transactions but two in five arenât confident they can identify the signs of human trafficking among transactions, according to a new report by BAE Systems Applied Intelligence â the cybercrime and intelligence arm of the defence, security and aerospace multinational.

More than one in 10 financial institutions still donât have an anti-money laundering strategy in place, BAE Systems has warned, despite it being a legal requirement.

Even if they do, just one in five in-house experts are confident they can stop the transactions or behaviour involved in human trafficking.

âTackling modern slavery is a priority for the NCAâs Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce where law enforcement, the financial sector and other agencies work to identify and tackle a wide range of serious crimes including human trafficking,â a spokesperson for UK Finance, the financial sectorâs trade association, said in response to the findings.

âThe sector spends over Â£5bn a year fighting economic crime, using a combination of advanced screening, monitoring technology and information sharing to target those who seek to transfer illicit funds through our financial system.

âThis includes preventing, identifying and disrupting attempts to abuse the legitimate financial system to launder the proceeds of modern slavery and human trafficking, with tackling of these crimes being an operational priority.

âAt the same time, the industry works in close partnership with the government and law enforcement through the Economic Crime Plan, using our combined powers to make the UK one of the safest and most transparent places in the world to conduct financial business.â

But it is clear that they will have to do better to demonstrate a stronger moral position to consumers if they want to keep them.

âThere has certainly been a marked shift in consumer attitudes towards banks and how they protect us over the last few years. Issues such as money laundering and trafficking are real-life human problems that are becoming more widely reported and understood,â says Horton.

âThree-quarters of [consumers] want their banks to be more transparent about this sort of criminal activity â in particular, demonstrating how it impacts customers as well as the wider society.â",0
260,"A serial fraudster who posed as a solicitor and pretended to represent âextremely vulnerableâ women in court cases has been jailed for four years and handed a ten-year restraining order.

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Daveyâs bank account.

All dealings with the âsolicitorâ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

At one point, Davey told a mother that she had won full custody of her children and had been awarded Â£65,000.

As a result of Daveyâs deception, the women were not represented in court and both their cases were put in âsevere jeopardyâ.

According to the police statement, Davey also posed as a police officer and a probation worker and convinced a woman he was in love with her in order to extort money. The court heard that Davey extorted more than Â£7,000 in total from his victims.",1
169,"U.S. authorities have successfully prosecuted an illegal Las Vegas money transfer scheme that used a method similar to one in B.C.

Canadian authorities have been criticized for their tepid money-laundering prosecution record, including in late 2017 when a major money-laundering case collapsed in British Columbia.

article continues below

It used the same method cited in the Las Vegas case. That method â where cash is given gamblers in exchange for money in a Chinese bank â had been dubbed the âVancouver modelâ by an Australian academic.

On Feb. 3, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of California announced that Bing Han and Lei Zhang pleaded guilty in Federal Court for operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses.

The pair face a maximum five years in prison.

In statement, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office said the guilty pleas are believed to be the first in the U.S. for a form of unlawful underground banking that transfers money between the U.S. and China that circumvents domestic and foreign laws. Chinese citizens are only allowed to transfer US$50,000 a year out of that country.

B.C. Attorney General David Eby, who has been a critic of Canadaâs money-laundering prosecutions, said the similarities in the Las Vegas and Vancouver cases and their different prosecution outcomes are striking. âAmericans seem to be more than willing to use their tax system and their anti-money-laundering system to support aggressive prosecutions, and Canadians simply donât,â Eby said.

Eby has been pushing the Trudeau government for a boost in investigations and prosecution capacity, which he says has not materialized .

Queenâs University law professor Arthur Cockfield said that Canada has some successful prosecutions for international money laundering but most of them collapse.

âItâs a real problem,â he said.

It is complex to prosecute money laundering, but this American prosecution shows it is feasible, said Cockfield.

Garry Clement, a former RCMP superintendent who served as national director of the proceeds of crime program, said it is disheartening that prosecutions are possible in the U.S. but not in Canada.

Clement said what is needed is both legislative changes to strengthen Canadian laws against money laundering and more policing resources and expertise.

The investigation into Han and Zhangâs financial operation included special agents from Homeland Security investigations, the Internal Revenue Serviceâs Las Vegas financial crimes task force and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The money laundering scheme described in Las Vegas is very similar to the model described by RCMP in court documents of the E-Pirate investigation that alleged an illicit money transfer business in Richmond laundered as much as $220 million in drug trafficking money.

Cash was provided to high stakes gamblers who used it in Lower Mainland casinos. The gamblers in turn deposited Chinese currency in Chinese banks to pay for the cash.

Those involved in the illicit money-transfer business took a cut of the transfers, similar to the cut taken by the Las Vegas money transferers, according to the plea agreement filed in U.S. court.

Han, for example, received a five per cent fee.

According to the plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court, Han collected U.S. dollars in cash and delivered the cash to gamblers from China.

The gambler would transfer an equivalent value of currency from the gamblersâ Chinese bank to an account designated by Han.",1

159,"The former chief executive of the top-performing New York Stock Exchange company in 1996 was ordered held without bail Friday on charges of insider trading, manipulating his companyâs inventory and securities fraud.

Emanuel Pinez, 58, an Israeli citizen who has homes in Canada, Switzerland and suburban Boston, was until Tuesday the head of Centennial Technologies Inc., which saw its stock price increase 450% during the year to reach $58.25.

Before his firing Tuesday, Pinez apparently told the companyâs board of directors that he inflated the amount of inventory sold, and he admitted advancing his own money to customers to buy the inventory, the U.S. attorney in Boston said.

The exchange halted trading in the stock of the personal computer card maker Tuesday, shortly before the firm said it had fired Pinez. Company shares have not traded since Monday, when it closed at $16.375.

Analysts expect the stock to open in the single digits when and if trading resumes.

FBI agents arrested Pinez at his Beverly, Mass., home early Friday after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging he âshortedâ his former company.

The federal complaint alleges that Pinez bought and sold more than 4,400 option contracts at a time when he had orchestrated a number of accounting improprieties that were being investigated by the companyâs board of directors.

Beginning Feb. 7, Pinez allegedly started buying put options and selling call options to expire on March 21, the complaint said. Call options give an investor the right to buy a stock at a certain price, while put options allow the sale at a certain price.

The SEC said Pinezâs minimum profit on the call options will be $447,500.

1059,"BEIJING  The next phase of Chinese President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption crackdown will see almost five times as many officials in Beijing under the state's watchful eye, officials said Tuesday.

In the past five years, Xis sweeping drive has punished more than 1.5 million corrupt Communist Party officials, including former political rivals and senior military leaders. Observers say such measures have boosted Xi's popularity among ordinary people.

For the first time, authorities gave foreign journalists access to the once-secretive apparatus behind the anti-graft campaign which has helped Xi consolidate his rule. He is now seeking a controversial measure that eliminates term limits and will potentially allow him to remain in power indefinitely.

Beijing has been chosen together with two other provinces to pilot the crackdown's expansion beyond the ruling Communist Party to government officials and people working for state-owned enterprises as well as those providing education, health and other services.

The new measure will leave almost a million officials in China's capital city facing monitoring and regular disciplinary check-ups, a huge increase from the 210,000 previously impacted. Beijing is home to around 21 million people.

This will ensure that supervision covers everyone working in the public sector who exercises public power, said Zhang Shuofu, director-general of the newly established Beijing Municipal Supervision Commission.

Both the Communist Partys disciplinary body and the city governments watchdog agency will work together in a multi-story office building.

More than 770 officials have been transferred from other departments to bolster this new apparatus.

""Abuse of power, dereliction of duty ... malpractice for personal gains, and waste of state assets,"" will all be targeted, according to Zhang.

Whistleblowers will be welcomed at a reception hall that can sit 30 people.

We will insure the identity and legal rights of whistleblowers and protect them from retaliation, said Liu Zeqing, the reception director.

In severe cases, the commission will employ the new power of detention to assist with any investigation. Suspects can be held for three months to six months, with that amount of time potentially deducted from any subsequent term of imprisonment.

""We firmly believe that our political environment will, through tireless efforts, like seas fallen calm and rivers running clean, be clear and free of corruption,"" Zhang added.",0
426,"The Supreme Court on Friday, August 9, 2019 ordered the reopening of the US$247,500 case that involved operatives of the National Security Agency (NSA), including the agencys former director, Fombah Sirleaf, a son of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and some Korean investors, as part of the corruption investigation that the Special Independent Committee initiated since late 2014.

The committee, headed by the late Counselor David A.B. Jallah, then Dean and Professor of Law at the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law, University of Liberia, was instructed by Madam Sirleaf to investigate the incident.

The courts decision on Friday was necessitated by a judgment of then assigned Judge Peter Gbeneweleh of the 13 th Judicial Circuit Court in Margibi County. However, Gbeneweleh dismissed the Korean businessmens US$2,849,000 Action of Damages for Wrong lawsuit against the NSA.

The investors in their 2015 suit claimed that while in custody at NSA headquarters, they were stripped naked and subjected to various forms of humiliation without any formal charge and were never advised of their rights as required by the law.

In his ruling at the time, Judge Gbeneweleh said that the Korean nationals produced insufficient evidence to reasonably support their accusation that they were subjected to various forms of humiliation and degradation, thereby supporting the NSA lawyers Motion for Judgment During Trial filed to the court.

A motion for judgment as a matter of law, is made by a party during trial, claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case. If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party, judgment is entered by the court and the case is over, a legal expert explained to the Daily Observer.

Besides, Gbeneweleh ordered that the NSAs operatives should not take the witness stand to provide their individual testimony about the accusation.

However, reading the High Courts opinion, Justice Yussif Kaba, said the evidence produced by the Korean investors when they rested their case created a rebuttal presumption, therefore, the trial judge was in error when he granted the judgment during the trial.

Justice Kaba: The courts judgment is reversed, therefore, the case is hereby remanded for a new trial.

It can be recalled that the Jallah Commission produced a 3-volume, 399-page report and handed it at first to Dr. Edward McClain (now deceased), then Minister of State for Presidential affairs, instead of President Sirleaf.

The Jallah Commission found out that the Korean businessmen committed no crime as the NSA had alleged to justify the seizure and arrest.

Further, the Jallah Commission uncovered an NSA operatives conspiracy directly involved, along with the gold dealer Naseer Aly, and two others from outside the agency, to defraud the Korean businessmen.

Among the reports recommendations, the committee called for return of the cash seized to the Korean businessmen, and for the matter to be referred to the Ministry of Justice to prosecute all conspirators.

The investigation further found that the seizure was an NSA operatives conspiracy and co-conspirators outside the agency, who had lured the Korean businessmen to Liberia, and recommended prosecution of all perpetrators.

President Sirleaf did not heed to the Jallahs recommendation, which prompted the Korean investors to file the lawsuit of US$2,849,000 as damages against the NSA.

Madam Christiana Tah, then Minister of Justice and Attorney General, resigned, accusing President Sirleaf of interference in an NSA investigation.

The case grew when a group of four Korean businessmen had arranged the purchase of gold bars through emails with Nasser Aly, whom they believed to be a Lebanese gold dealer with mining interests in Liberia.

Under the deal negotiated by Kim Aleck, one of the Korean businessmen, the counter parties agreed to the sale of 16 kilograms (35 lbs) of gold at the price of US$568,000.

Half of the purchase price, amounting to US$284,000, was to be paid upfront in Liberia.

On July 8, 2014, the NSA operatives carried out a raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia, without a warrant.

Five NSA operatives burst into a hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes.

The NSA seized cash in the amount of US$247,500 and other possessions, including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards.

Earlier, on the day of the raid, the Korean businessmen had withdrawn the same amount of money seized from the Sinkor, Old Road branch of the International Bank of Liberia and then gone directly to the City King Hotel, expecting to complete the transaction with Aly.

The Korean businessmen were arrested by the operatives and taken from the hotel to the headquarters of the NSA.

Later, NSA charged the Korean nationals with the commission of crimes of illegal possession of combustible cyanide that posed national security risk to the lives of Liberians, money laundering, counterfeiting, and conspiracy to defraud the government.

The criminal charges were later dropped against the Korean investors by the Criminal Court C at the Temple of Justice, which prompted their civil lawsuit against the NSA.",1
856,"President Duterte may be exasperated with corruption in government but is unlikely to quit his post with only two years left on his six-year term, MalacaÃ±ang said Tuesday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the President would instead use the remainder of his term to fight corruption in government.

âHindi natuloy ang resignation ni Presidente. Tingin ko hindi siya magre-resign ngayon dahil dalawang taon na lamang natitira sa kanyang termino. Pero igugugol ang natitirang panahon niya para linisin ang mga ibaât-ibang ahensya ng ating gobyerno (The Presidentâs resignation did not push through. I think he will not resign now because he has two years left in his term. But he will use the remaining term to clean up government agencies),â Roque said during a televised press briefing Tuesday.

Roque admitted that this was not the first time the President offered to resign, saying he has expressed frustration that corruption remained rampant in government. He maintained that the President has âzero toleranceâ for corruption, citing his efforts to clean up the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.

Asked if the President was serious in his resignation offer, Roque said: âLetâs just say heâs serious about his expression of exasperation with corruption.â

In his televised address Monday night, the President bared that he has offered to resign because he was fed up with corruption in government. Citing his long experience in public service, Duterte admitted it was difficult to eliminate corruption.

The President, in the same remarks, disclosed plans to enhance the anti-corruption efforts. He said he was ready to appear before Congress to discuss ways to âcut corruptionâ and simplify government rules to promote the ease of doing business in the country. He said he has an âalmost radicalâ plan against corruption.

951,"Corruption, graft, and palm-greasing are a real and growing drag on the global economy  and they open the door to a host of evils like drug smuggling and human trafficking. Bribes to the tune of about $1.5 trillion change hands every year, according to the International Monetary Fund, or about 5 percent of global GDP.

And the true cost of corruption doesnt just boil down to money, either. You cant have narco-trafficking without bribery, human trafficking without bribery, or even terrorism without bribery, said Alexandra Wrage, president and founder of the anti-bribery organization TRACE International.

TRACE says that bribery is getting worse, with global graft on the rise, according to a new study. Some 60 percent of countries have an increased bribery risk compared with the 2014 study, while only 32 percent have a decreased bribery risk, the group says. While anti-bribery laws and enforcement are on the upswing in many countries, government transparency and capacity for civil society oversight of anti-bribery are not.

The study shows the cleanest  and most graft-prone  countries around the world, ranking countries on a scale of 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher bribery risks.

See how each country stacks up here:

Sweden comes out on top with a score of 10, followed by New Zealand at 15 and Estonia at 17. The most bribery-prone country in the world is Nigeria, with a score of 99. Russia is actually getting cleaner, TRACE says, improving from a score of 65 two years ago to 58 today. China, despite a huge anti-corruption drive in Beijing, sits immobile with a score of 66.

Even the United States even saw a slight increase in bribery risk, going from a score of 27 in 2014 to a score of 34 in 2016, though its still a lot closer to Sweden than Swaziland. The United States improved anti-bribery laws, according to the study, but saw its score rise because of increased business-to-government interactions and a slight backslide in civil society oversight of bribery.

Generally, more places have gotten worse than have gotten better, Virna Di Palma, senior director of global strategy with TRACE, told Foreign Policy. In particular, the Americas, Africa, and East Asia are backsliding on fighting corruption, Di Palma said.

Corruption hemorrhages public trust in governments. A Transparency International study released in November found, after surveying 60,000 Europeans and Central Asians, 53 percent thought their governments handled corruption poorly, while only 23 percent thought they were doing well. One in three surveyed thought their governments officials and lawmakers were mostly corrupt. Even in the supposedly cleaner and more advanced West, public ire at corruption  whether real or perceived  helps fuel populist political movements.

All is not necessarily lost, though, says Wrage. Corporate behavior is getting more legal scrutiny around the world. And if bribery scores are high now, it may be because bribery was simply more difficult to track in the past. Its not that theres more bribery, its that its more visible, Wrage said.

Companies are also learning that dirty business can be bad business, says Di Palma. Additionally, small and medium-sized companies  not just multinationals  are beginning to take anti-graft measures more seriously.

We see the world trending in the right direction, Di Palma said. Initially companies were only interested because of increased anti-bribery enforcement, but in the last few years weve seen a change, she said, adding that companies are recognizing that bribery is a bad business strategy.",0
851,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia â Construction companies face corruption risks throughout all steps of construction from submission of building permit requests until the State Committee endorses that building meets all technical requirements and standards. Corruption costs affect both small and large construction companies alike, and as a result increases the price paid by consumers. So, what are specific corruption risks at each of these stages and how can we address them? This was the main theme of the discussion held at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Mongolia on 23 November 2015 among construction companies, professional associations, and relevant government agencies.

The discussion was heated and frank, and revealed serious corruption risks and implications.The government entity granting building permits does not take any accountability for damages caused by licensed construction companies. In other words, no one checks if the construction company in question had necessary technical capacity in the first place. When buildings are found to be sub-standard, there is no accountability provision for construction inspectors, who originally signed that the building was fit for use. Lately, instead of asking for bribe money, there have been demands to own shares of construction companies in exchange for different types of permits.

Ms. Bat-otgon, Director of Prevention and Public Awareness, Independent Authority Against Corruption, noted, âCorruption was regarded as mostly related to public sector, but increasingly this is also true for the private sectorâ. Indeed, investors and owners of construction companies find that it is quite common among mid-level managers to earn money by obtaining discounted construction material, but charging non-discounted prices in formal contracts.

Finally, construction companies emphasized the importance of engaging them in development of various construction related codes and regulations.

The discussion was organized jointly by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Mongolia, the Independent Authority Against Corruption, and UNDP, as part of the 2015 International Anticorruption Day campaign.",0
456,"BRASILIA, Brazil  Brazil's corruption crisis struck the heart of President Michel Temer's government Tuesday, April 11, with the opening of probes into no less than 9 ministers.

What Brazilian media called ""the bomb"" and even ""the atomic bomb"" landed when the Supreme Court authorized probes against 108 politicians in the already giant ""Car Wash"" investigation.

The investigation into a massive embezzlement and bribery conspiracy that fleeced state oil company Petrobras and funneled dirty money into leading political parties' election war chests has already been running 3 years.

But the new probes threaten the stability of Temer's deeply unpopular government just as he struggles to enact austerity measures in a bid to pull Brazil out of a historic recession.

Supreme Court documents showed that 9 ministers were on the list of targeted politicians, all suspected of involvement in the Car Wash scheme.

They included Temer's influential chief of staff Eliseu Padilha, newly appointed Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, and Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi.

In addition, the Supreme Court authorized probes against 3 state governors, 29 senators and 42 members of the lower house of Congress, the respected Estadao newspaper reported. Among the lawmakers were the speakers of the upper and lower houses.

The Supreme Court handles all cases involving sitting politicians and was responding to a March request by top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot to open the cases.

The accusations in Janot's list are based on a deluge of testimony given in connection with plea bargains struck with 77 former executives of the giant Odebrecht construction firm, which was at the heart of the Petrobras scheme.

The former Odebrecht employees, including ex-CEO Marcelo Odebrecht, have confessed to systemic bribery of politicians in exchange for inflated contracts with Petrobras and favorable legislation in Congress. The money went either directly into politicians' pockets or into party campaign slush funds.

Speculation had been mounting over the fallout for Temer's center-right government from the publication of the Supreme Court list.

Temer, pushing for painful economic reforms as Brazil enters its third year of recession, already faced questions over his legitimacy.

He took over last year from leftist president Dilma Rousseff after she was impeached for illegal handling of government finances. She claims she was victim of a coup.

Several of Temer's ministers have already had to resign due to involvement in the Car Wash scandal.

The Supreme Court is so far only authorizing investigations and Temer has already said he will not sack any minister who had not been formally charged with a crime.

But the probes further discredit Temer's ruling PMDB party, with its senior senator Romero Juca, among those on the list.

Also targeted is Aecio Neves, who heads the centrist PSDB party and narrowly lost Brazil's last presidential election.

The huge scandal has already claimed a host of big politicians and business figures.

Former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from the Workers' Party faces multiple Car Wash probes.

Rousseff, who succeeded her mentor Lula, is reported to be on Janot's list, but this has not been confirmed.

Since they are no longer elected officials, the two former presidents are dealt with by lower courts, not the Supreme Court.  Rappler.com",1

According to Business Today, the ED identified properties worth INR 30 billion ($420.8 million) allegedly belonging to Wadhawan in the country and abroad.

The agency suspects these assets were bought with funds siphoned off from DHFL and laundered through hawala (a traditional system of transferring money) channels.

Wadhawan was arrested in relation to this chain of events, which also involved gangster Dawood Ibrahims close aide Iqbal Mirchi.

Its a complex case but the above summary will suffice. There has been plenty of speculation around this matter  i.e. he was booted out  and Fintech Direct contacted Zopa today (10 February) to ensure complete accuracy.

The firm responded quickly, albeit in the style of Ernest Hemingway: As part of the planned [£140 million] investment by IAG, we are reorganising our board. As part of this process, WGC have agreed to give up their board seat in Zopa post the completion of the deal, and Kapil Wadhawan has resigned from the Zopa Group Board with immediate effect.

You can mull about the timing. But either way its not the kind of news story Zopa wants.

WGC got involved with the lendtech back in 2017 when it was part of Zopas £32 million Series F funding round. As part of that deal, Wadhawan got on the Zopa board, opened a UK subsidiary, and took a stake in the firm.

What did Zopa get? A massive headache probably.

Along with being arrested, Wadhawans DHFL has been having major troubles with liquidity issues for a while. (A long story itself.) Also today, the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Contributory Provident Fund Trust moved the National Company Law Tribunal to recover dues from DHFL. The trust claims that DHFL owes it more than INR $1.48 billion ($20.7 million) that it invested in the lenders fixed deposits.",1
786,"MANILA, Philippines â Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Jaime Morente on Wednesday expressed his belief that the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 is âvery oldâ and is in dire need of updating to solve the alleged corrupt activities in the bureau.

âThe Philippine Immigration Act is a very old law, 80 years old to be exact,â Morente said in a statement.

âI have talked to the President and raised this concern to him,â he further stated.

Morente said that since the law was enacted during a time when there were no international flights yet entering and leaving the country, âmany of its provisions are already outdated and inappropriate already.â

The BI chief said updating the law would âanswer salary woes, remove systemic issues, plug loopholes in policies, update fines and penalties, ensure division of power, and confer to the Commissioner the proper disciplinary powers.â

The proposal to revisit the countryâs immigration law was pushed following corruption issues allegedly involving some of the bureauâs personnel.

More than 80 officials and employees of the Immigration bureau are facing investigation and charges before the Office of the Ombudsman over allegations of accepting bribes in exchange for escorting Chinese and other foreign nationals who wish to dodge the immigration screening process in airports.

The scheme was called âpastillas,â named after a local soft milk candy, because the bribe money that some personnel receive are concealed inside rolled up papers resembling the dessert.

According to Morente, they have already implemented measures to address corruption in the bureau.

âThe short-term solution is relieve all those found to have been involved in corrupt practices, hence we relieved all names implicated in the Pastillas issue, and implemented a one strike policy for anyone who tries to follow suit,â he said.

âThe medium-term solution is reorganizing the system,â he added as he revealed that the supervision of the bureauâs Travel Control and Intelligence Unit and the Border Control and Intelligence Unit have been transferred under a different division to âadd layers of checks and balances.â

Morente said the move will âserve as a sort of audit to the actions of those in the Port Operations Division, and dismantles any semblance of a central control of possible illegal activities.â

He, however, stressed that the real and long-term solution is the updating of the Philippine Immigration Act.

âWe can remove people again and again, but the loopholes in the law remain. Quick wins may cure some symptoms in the anti- corruption drive but a responsive new Immigration law may yet cure systemic problems that breed corruption,â he said.

The BI chief earlier lamented that under the existing law, he has no disciplinary powers over his personnel, as âthe power to hire and fire rests with the Secretary of Justice.â

The Immigration bureau is an attached agency of the Department of Justice.

Morente said the proposal to amend the Philippine Immigration law is already in Congress and called for its immediate passage.

âWe thank our lawmakers for the support in our move to modernize the bureau so that once and for all we can rid of systemic issues that remain because of outdated policies,â he said.",0

A businessman involved in a âhighly sophisticatedâ boiler room scam has been jailed for seven years today.

Muhammad Tanveer, of South Street, Romford was one of four men jailed for money laundering offences at Southwark Crown Court on Friday, April 26.

Tanveer, 30, was part of a group of eight who ran an elaborate scam from 2014 until 2016, conning more than 50 people out of Â£1.6million by convincing them to invest in fake companies.

In particular they would target elderly and often vulnerable individuals, with some people being scammed by the group more than once.

Judge Joanna Korner told the court: âThe reason this fraud was particularly unpleasant was that part of it was aimed at many people who had already been defrauded.

âThe frauds were highly sophisticated.â

A boiler room fraud sees criminals make cold calls or emails to people pretending to be from an established and legitimate company, persuading them to invest in what are in fact completely worthless or non-existent stocks. Often high pressured sales tactics are used, which is why they're described as boiler room.

The scam saw more than 50 people lose out to the con, with one victim, aged 83, losing just over Â£1m.

Another victim, who lost around Â£300,000, said in an impact statement to the police: âThe financial loss has had a significant impact on my family and a longer term impact on not being able to provide for my family and children.â

Another told the police he couldn't sleep and had lost weight because of all the stress.

Judge Korner identified Tanveer as playing a leading role in the scam. He helped set up the companies used for the fraud, made arrangements for the websites and logos, and had direct contact with some of the investors.

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington was jailed for four years on Friday, April 26 for his part in a boiler room scam which conned elderly people out of Â£3million. Picture: ERSOU

âDuring the course of the evidence, [Tanveer] told lie after lie,â said judge Korner.

âSome of which were particularly outrageous. Even after being convicted in the first trial he declined to plead guilty.â

In addition to being jailed for a maximum of seven years, Tanveer was disqualified from acting as a director of a company for 10 years.

You may also want to watch:

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington, not only played a pivotal role in the scam but âheavily influencedâ his cousin Lucy Richardson, 25, and his mother, Mandy Cross, 30, both also from Orpington, into setting up the fraudulent accounts.

He was jailed for four years and eight months and disqualified from acting as the director of a company for seven years.

Richardson was given a suspended sentence of two years for a two year period and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and Mandy Cross, who used some of the money she gained from the scam to holiday in Mexico, was given a suspended sentence of 12 months for two years and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk, also played a key role in the scam. He had just been freed from prison for previous fraud convictions when he met Tanveer.

The court found that he was at high risk of reoffending and he was jailed for six years.

Ryan Weston, 27, from Wisbech, was jailed for a total of three years and six months after pleading guilty to money laundering at a trial on Monday, April 8.

Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk, pleaded guilty to money laundering at an earlier court date and was given a 20 months suspended sentence for two years, ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from being a director of a company for five years.

Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay, was given a 15 months suspended sentence for two years and disqualified from acting as a director of a company for five years.

Judge Korner said: âThese types of boiler room fraud are both pervasive, pernicious and mean and they produce large rewards for those who commit them.

âNo one who reads or watches the media can fail to be aware that, notwithstanding the organisations set up by the police, only a tiny proportion of fraud receives investigations.

âI have no doubt that police resources are struggling. It's imperative that more time and resources are devoted not just to cyber crime but also these type of fraud of cases.â

Alistair Dickson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: âThis was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didn't exist.

âCommon to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable.

âPersuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told.

âThe reality is that the gang conned their way to nearly Â£3m.â",1
156,"A prisoner ran a two-year-long drug smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone and mail, a court has heard.

Craig Sutton, 37, carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.

The offences only came to light when Sutton's cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.

He will be sentenced in October.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit Â£30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.

The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.

Letters seized

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton's cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.

A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.

""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson's bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""

Prisons investigation

Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.

Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""

Lord Burns said: ""It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.""",1
588,"The UKs Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at mining and commodity trading group Glencore.

The SFO said it is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons.

In a statement, the £30bn company added: Glencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group.

Glencore, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation.

Its share price fell by 9% on the news to close at 216.9p, a three-year low. The company is the worlds biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium.

The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africas biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007.

The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC.

Gertlers notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nations former president Joseph Kabila  who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year  has long been a source of controversy.

Gertler was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the countrys diamonds.

The Israeli was also named in a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue.

In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC.

The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are false and without any basis whatsoever, that he rejects them absolutely, and that he transacts business fairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law.

Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own.

The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as the biggest tax evasion case in United States history.

He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on trading with the enemy. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBIs most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001.

By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993.

Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the worlds biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones.

When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at £38bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since.",1
1022,"KINGSTON, Jamaica (JIS)  United States (US) Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno, says the US Mission in Jamaica is working closely with local stakeholders to curb financial crimes and boost regulatory compliance of financial institutions.
This is in response to the threat of international correspondent banks cutting ties with local and regional financial institutions in a move to eliminate risk of crimes such as money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.
Moreno, addressing the final day of the fifth Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Conference at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel on Tuesday, said his Mission recognises the critical nature of correspondent banking relationships to the local economy.
As such, he said the embassy is seeking to help local partners build capacity, increase transparency and comply with the regulatory framework of the US.
We have mutual interest in fighting the scourge. We are partners in this effort; and together, through more dialogue and action, we can combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism without sacrificing the important correspondent banking relationships, Moreno said.
He noted that the US Embassy has offered training in best practices to law-enforcement, prosecutors and other stakeholders on how to combat financial crimes.
They also provide training to investigators at the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) and the Financial Investigations Division (FID) and help in criminal investigations that lead to money-laundering charges.
Moreno said the Embassy has also trained regulators in non-financial sectors, such as realtors, accountants and attorneys, as well as professionals from the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission and the Casino Gaming Commission in developing sound practices to ensure risk of money laundering and terrorism financing are understood, identified and reported.
We work with our counterparts, law enforcement and regulatory, to develop and share money-laundering and terrorism-financing methods and trends, he said.
The US Embassy also has an ongoing Jamaica Operations Linked to Telemarketing (JOLT) Task Force designed to facilitate identification, investigation and prosecution of telemarketers who victimise US and Jamaican citizens.
Deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism are a few drivers of de-risking that jurisdictions can address. It is essential that countries and their financial institutions work to improve their controls, and its also important that they publicise the efforts in an increasingly risk-averse economic climate, he said.
He said the US Government is working to develop appropriate policy responses to advance the objective of combating financial crimes, while also providing and promoting financial inclusion.
Correspondent banking involves a bank in one country facilitating certain services for a financial institution in another country, including wire transfers, business transactions, deposits and gathering of documents.
Over the last five years, a number of international banks have restricted or ended their relationship with the region due to concerns about money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing.
The two-day Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism Conference, to facilitate discussion on strengthening compliance, was hosted by the Jamaica Bankers Association (JBA) and the Jamaica Institute of Financial Services (JIFS), under the theme Understanding our obligations Safeguarding our Future.",0
1036,"Best recognized for her role as Rebecca Donaldson on the long-running hit comedy series Full House, Lori Loughlin (pronounced LOCK-lin) has now added another series to her resume  When Calls the Heart. Inspired by Jeanette Okes best seller, Loughlin plays Abigail Stanton, a wife and mother living in Coal Valley, a small, simple coal mining town in 1910, whose husband had just been tragically killed in a mining explosion. The story follows her and other widowed women as they strive to maintain regularity for their families and struggle to keep a roof over their heads.

Loughlin recently costarred in the CWs last incarnation of 90210. She portrayed the mother of two teenagers who struggled with her familys move from the normalcy in Kansas to the fast lane of Beverly Hills. Following 90210, Loughlin costarred in the comedy feature Old Dogs in which she played opposite Robin Williams and John Travolta (she played the latters love interest). One of her more recent feature films was Moondance Alexander, in which she portrayed an eccentric mother whose daughter finds a pony and is determined to win the Bow Valley Classic, learning that loyalty and individuality can land you in the winners circle.

Born and raised in Hauppauge, Long Island, Loughlin got her start in show business at a young age. She was cast in the daytime drama The Edge of Night, for which she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Young Actress in a Daytime Series.

In 1985, Loughlin was cast in the feature film Secret Admirer, a romantic comedy co-starring C. Thomas Howell and Kelly Preston. She also starred opposite Treat Williams in Critical Mass. Her other feature film credits include the beach movie spoof Back to the Beach, as well as Rad, about BMX racing and Amityville 3-D, the third installment of the Amityville horror movie franchise.

795,"The government is planning to introduce a new law to force all businesses to assess their risk of a terrorist attack and take measures to cope with the threat.

Details of the new legislation emerged at the inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing, where Shaun Hipgrave - from the government's Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) - was giving evidence.

Mr Hipgrave, who is part of the Home Office, acknowledged the legislation would have ""such an impact on this country that we want to get it right"".

It appears to be designed to echo health and safety legislation by putting a duty on businesses and local authorities to take into account the risk of terrorism and to train their staff to deal with that risk.

The police only have 200 counter-terrorism security advisers across the whole country and the legislation is expected to affect up to 650,000 venues.

To cope with the demand, the government is already developing an online ""platform"" to help firms understand the risk.

The move is supported by some of the families of the victims of the Manchester attack in May 2017 - which killed 22 people - particularly Figen Murray, who is seeking to introduce legislation dubbed Martyn's law after her son Martyn Hett died in the atrocity.

Mr Hipgrave said the government would apply the legislation to ""publicly accessible locations"" from small venues with 30 customers right up to the O2 Arena in London, but insisted there would be ""proportionality"".

The areas include sectors such as health, education, retail and leisure; faith groups and LGBT groups; public spaces, towns, villages, and ""grey space""; and large venues similar to the Manchester Arena.

Mr Hipgrave said the purpose of the laws were to ""ensure there are no gaps where there are areas where the public have access and someone can say I wasn't accountable.

""Someone is accountable in all those areas, and by accountable, I mean accountable for the security of the public in all those locations.

""If anyone leaves their home and walks down the street, drops their children off at nursery, goes to shops or the cinema, the public wouldn't know it, but someone is responsible for their protection because they are in a publicly accessible location.""

""No view"" has been reached on whether breaching the legislation would be a criminal or civil offence, or how inspection and enforcement would work, he added.

Ministers have given their approval and consultation was supposed to open in September, but it has been delayed by the second coronavirus lockdown in England, because many of those who will be affected have been furloughed, Mr Hipgrave said.

He also said the new legislation was the ""only credible answer that will have the impact that ministers expect and ministers intend.""",0

The vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe has been arrested in connection with an investigation into the awarding of a doctorate to former first lady Grace Mugabe.

Levi Nyagura was detained by the country's anti-corruption agency, to be charged with abuse of office.

Mrs Mugabe was awarded a PhD just months after enrolling in 2014, despite it usually taking years to complete.

An investigation was launched after a petition was made by university staff.

Members of the sociology department said they had not seen supporting evidence, and called for the nullification of her qualification and a full investigation.

The polarising Grace Mugabe

The PhD's authenticity was questioned because her thesis was not published alongside others at the time.

The document was only published online in January this year, four years after she graduated, and has been the subject of intense speculation since.

She was awarded the qualification by her husband and then-President Robert Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the university at the time.

The doctorate title was used on campaign material for Mrs Mugabe as she became increasingly involved in politics.

In November Robert Mugabe was ousted from office after 37 years of rule amid growing speculation his wife was lining herself up to replace her aging husband in power.",1
933,"If there was one principal outcome from President Trumps meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on August 20, it was an alignment of expectations for the future US-Iraqi relationship. On the most important US concern, Kadhimi did not promise to eliminate Iranian influence in Iraq, and Trump did not press him on it. He did not need to.

The visit itself, and others like it, is much of how the United States competes with Iran in Iraq: through engagements, visits, and other symbolic gestures, which reinforce the current political trends of an Iraqi populace that simultaneously wants US engagement with Iran, does not want to confront militias militarily, and, above all else, does not want a US-Iran confrontation to materialize on its soil. And that is usually good enough for American national-security interests.

The Iraqi prime ministers visit was important first and foremost as a message to Iraqs public and political class. The visit should be viewed as neither an American concession to Kadhimi nor an American reward for policy steps he has taken, but rather a tool in the competition for political influence between the United States and Iran in Iraq. It is no coincidence that Iran also hosted Kadhimi for a similar high-profile visit a month ago, before he visited the United States and intended to visit Saudi Arabiain Iraqi politics, a victory for Iran.

The meeting provided a message to the same Iraqi audience about Irans influence with Iraqs new leader. Iran similarly used last Novembers visit by the Iraqi populist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to send a message to Iraqis protesting its influence over Iraqs internal affairs. Sadr controlled one of the few militias with the capability to defend the protestors, and Iran wanted them to know he would not intervene to protect them, even though Tehran couldnt be sure that this was the case. The symbolism is the message with these visits, not necessarily the immediate policy results.

The second consideration to keep in mind is that the Iranian government does not own the Iraqi prime minister, and neither does the United States. I worked with Kadhimi for years while at the US State Department and always admired his pragmatism, his support for Iraqi nationalism, and his genuine pro-US sentiments, while acknowledging that he, like every single Iraqi politician, was ultimately a realist. Any Iraqi leader who becomes prime minister will represent shades of strategic gray for the United States.

As a predominantly Shia country, and one that is economically tied to Iran, Iraq is unlikely to produce a leader who will share the same perception of regional security as that of US partners such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. However, if the United States plays its cards right, the Iraqis are unlikely to choose a leader from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and their political allies.

Thats enough to both limit Iraqs threat to US partners and shape the Iraqi political environment in a manner that mitigates domestic fallout as we compete with Iran in Iraq and the region.Our policy comfort in choosing among shades of gray will impact how good we are at it. If US officials refuse a visit to the US until Kadhimi does X, Y, and Z, the chances are less likely he will do those things. Its good we didnt.

Third, Iraqis also see this visit as more of a means of affording Kadhimi personal capital and less as some gauzy message about an amorphous bilateral relationship. In Iraq, the United States must gear its policy toward individuals and not institutions, because that is how the Iraqi political game is played. The United States cannot solve the problems of the modern Arab state; when it has tried, most spectacularly in the Iraq War, it has failed. But the United States can focus on necessary short-term results, particularly those that benefit both Iraqis and Americans, rather than gearing its methods to what it thinks Iraq should look like in twenty years. Almost certainly, in the decades ahead, Iraqi politics will still very much be an individual game, with powerful political leaders looking for sponsors.

Virtually every senior politician in Iraq receives some sort of support from one or many regional powers. In a life-or-death political environment, that is necessary. The United States must play this way because it is how the game is played. The tools are visits, visas, investment, aid, and sanctions. The more these can be targeted at an individual level, to reward and punish individuals and compete within the gray zone of Iraqi politics, the better results the United States will have.

Fourth, there will always be redlines. The most pressing strategic problem for the United States are those elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), militias raised and loosely incorporated under the governments aegis, that answer to Iran. During his joint press availability with Trump, Kadhimi completely ducked questions about the militias, instead stressing US help in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and the need for economic engagement. He delivered a similarly non-committal message to Iran last month.

Iraqi politicians want to adopt a see-no-evil policy toward the sharper edge of US-Iran competition in Iraq. Last summer, despite a series of explosions at PMF facilities, there was neither a binding Iraqi parliamentary vote to kick out US troops nor a political endorsement of reprisals, because civil war in Iraq is a political loser. Virtually no Iraqi wants the US-Iran competition to play out militarily in Iraq. The Iranians know it, their proxies know it, and Iraqi politicians know it. Thats a victory for the United States as it works to restrain the militias, the Iranians most potent tool.

At the joint press event with Kadhimi, Trump had it exactly right on militias: He said that when there are attacks, we deal with those attacks, but we do not burn down the house that the US and Iraq have built. Like his predecessors, Kadhimi cannot fix the seventeen-year problem of militias in Iraqi territory. The United States must be realistic about this problem, as the US has not been able to fix it either.

Indeed, in forty years of confronting Iran, the United States has never successfully solved the problem of Iranian support for militias acting as states within states. The US relationship with Kadhimi cannot depend on whether he succeeds where we have historically failed. Instead, Washington must compete in the gray zone, for partial victory, with all the tools at its disposal. This visit was a good start.",0
129,"A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about Â£8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than Â£400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about Â£400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.",1
462,"Standard Chartered has been ordered to pay $1.1bn (£842m) by US and UK authorities to settle allegations of poor money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries including Iran.

The British bank has agreed to pay $947m to American agencies, including the US Department of Justice, over allegations that it violated sanctions against a string of countries including Iran.

Separately, it was fined £102m by the Financial Conduct Authority for anti-money-laundering breaches that included shortcomings in its counter-terrorism finance controls in the Middle East. It is the second-largest fine ever imposed by the UK regulator for anti-money-laundering failures.

The US treasury department said the latest fines settled apparent violations of sanctions imposed against Burma, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, and Iran.

It said Standard Chartered processed transactions worth $438m between 2009 and 2014, the majority of which involved Iran-linked accounts from its Dubai branch routing payments through, or to, its New York office or other US-based banks.

The fines were widely expected after Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900m (£691m) to cover US and UK penalties. However, the final settlements will force the bank to take a further $190m hit in its first-quarter results, which it will report on 30 April.

Standard Chartered said on Tuesday it accepts full responsibility for the violations and control deficiencies, adding that the vast majority of the alleged incidents took place before 2012. None of the breaches occurred after 2014, it added.

But the bank, which is headquartered in London but focused on Asia, the Middle East and Africa, placed partial blame on two former junior employees, who were aware of certain customers Iranian connections and conspired with them to break the law, deceive the group and violate its policies. Standard Chartered said: Such behaviour is wholly unacceptable to the group.

Bill Winters, the chief executive, said: We are pleased to have resolved these matters and to put these historical issues behind us. The circumstances that led to todays resolutions are completely unacceptable and not representative of the Standard Chartered I am proud to lead today.

The settlements announced on Tuesday are, together, the largest imposed on Standard Chartered since 2012, when it paid $667m to put to rest US allegations of sanctions breaches between 2001 and 2007.

US assistant attorney general, Brian Benczkowski, said: Todays resolution sends a clear message to financial institutions and their employees: if you circumvent US sanctions against rogue states like Iran  or assist those who do  you will pay a steep price.

The Financial Conduct Authority had raised concerns about anti-money-laundering controls at Standard Chartereds UK-based correspondent bank and its United Arab Emirates branches. It highlighted serious shortcomings in customer due diligence and said the bank also failed to ensure its UAE branches applied proper counter-terrorist financing controls.

The FCA gave examples where a customer was able to open an account by handing over around 3m UAE dirham (£500,000) in cash in a suitcase, with little evidence that the source of the cash was investigated. It also said Standard Chartered failed to collect sufficient information on a customer exporting goods that could have a military application to regions involved in armed conflict.

The prospect of major fines have hung over Standard Chartered since 2012, when it entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the US Department of Justice and the New York county district attorneys office over Iranian sanctions breaches beyond 2007.

Other UK banks to have fallen foul of US authorities include RBS, which paid out more than $10bn in relation to the alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. In 2012, HSBC paid a fine of $1.9bn to settle US money-laundering allegations.

DPAs allow firms to settle charges with state authorities without facing criminal prosecution. The companies must agree to specified conditions, which can include a fine and their conduct being monitored for a set period.

The DPA was set to expire on Wednesday, but has now been extended until April 2021. Over the next two years Standard Chartered will effectively be on probation, giving US agencies the right to criminally prosecute the bank if it breaks the law.

Standard Chartered said it had undergone a comprehensive and positive transformation since the conduct and control issues ... occurred. The shares ended the day up 0.3% at 647p.",1

The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a new tool to detect fraudulent activity and better understand how it happens across the payments industry.

The FraudClassifier model is a set of tools and materials that create a more consistent way to classify fraud. It was developed by the Fraud Definitions Work Group.

According to the U.S. central bank, the tool will help organizations classify fraud independently of payment type, payment channel or other payment characteristics.

Payment fraud typically involves the use of stolen credentials or the exploitation of a security vulnerability in credit and debit card networks, including non-prepaid and prepaid debit card networks, the automated clearinghouse transfer system, and the check clearing system.

The overall rate of payments fraud, by value, has risen in the U.S. in recent years. And as the number of payments has risen, so too has the likelihood that a payment is fraudulent. Still, in 2018, payments fraud remained rare and represented just a fraction -- 1 percent -- of the total value of all payments.

The new tool unveiled by the Fed presents a series of questions to users, starting with who initiated the payment to determine whether it was an authorized or unauthorized user.",0
409,"This Is Still Happening is a new feature in which Slate will attempt to offer an update on Cabinet-level corruption, what could be done to bring the officials to account, and what Democrats are doing in response (generally, nothing). The second installment is about a figure who has been at the center of many Trump-era scandals, Steven Mnuchin.

The Official: Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin

What Is Still Happening: Mnuchin has been implicated in many, many, many scandals  big, medium, and small since President Donald Trump first nominated the former Goldman Sachs chief information officer, hedge fund manager, foreclosure specialist, and film executive to be secretary of the treasury. He has been most recently in the news not for any of that early-term malfeasance, but for his current and ongoing efforts to cover up Trumps tax returns.

In April, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal issued a formal request to the Internal Revenue Service for Trumps tax returns under a 1924 update to the tax code, which commanded that upon written request from the chairmen of the relevant committees, the Treasury Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request. Mnuchin, fulfilling an earlier promise to defy any such request, responded in May that he would not be furnishing the tax returns as the statute obligated. This came after Mnuchin acknowledged that his department had communicated with the White House about how it should handle the issue. As the Washington Post noted, the tax request process is designed to be walled off from White House interference, in part because of corruption that took place during the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. Oh, well!

In his response to Neal, Mnuchin argued that he could ignore both the spirit and the letter of the law, making an unsupported claim that the request for tax information lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. Even though the law says that the Secretary shall furnish the requested tax information, no questions asked, Neal had offered a legitimate legislative purpose for the request, namely to ensure that IRS policies subjecting presidential tax returns to mandatory examinations were being carried out properly. That legislative purpose only grew more urgent this past July when, according to a letter Neal sent Mnuchin in August, a federal whistleblower presented the committee with credible allegations of evidence of possible misconductspecifically, potential inappropriate efforts to influence the mandatory [presidential and vice presidential] audit program. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that the whistleblower was an IRS official who reported that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to interfere in the mandatory audit of the presidents or vice presidents returns.
Mnuchins refusal to turn over requested tax returns in direct violation of the law should clearly be a really big deal! Besides Neals stated legislative purpose, there are open questions about whether foreign-backed lenders provided financing to Trump at a time when the self-declared bankruptcy king struggled to entice other lenders, and the returns could clarify to what extent foreign actors might have financial leverage over the president. Further, because he failed to divest from his businesses, a tax return could illuminate how much money Trump continues to receive from foreign governments potentially seeking to curry his favor in direct violation of the Constitutions foreign emoluments clause. The returns could also help Congress find out if the president cheated on his taxes. Finally, all of this could be part of a case for impeachment.

But it would be unfair to Mnuchin to focus strictly on his misconduct as an appendage of the presidents misconduct. The treasury secretary has done plenty of sketchy to unlawful things on his own, in apparent service of his own interests. Whether helping himself or his boss, hes accumulated a remarkable list of grifting accomplishments:

 Before Mnuchins confirmation he acknowledged that he had failed to disclose to the Senate Finance Committee nearly $100 million in assets, as well as his role as a director of an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a notorious tax shelter.

 As part of that confirmation process, Mnuchin lied to Congress: He denied that under his management, OneWest Bankan institution that specialized in foreclosures in the aftermath of the financial crisishad participated in the practice of robo-signing foreclosure documents without doing the necessary diligence. Contrary to Mnuchins Senate testimony, a former vice president of OneWest testified in court that she signed 750 foreclosure documents a week without reviewing many of them; that she took 30 seconds per document; and that she had changed my signature considerably to accommodate her OneWest signing practices, adding that its just an E now. Its worth noting that shortly after Mnuchin entered office, the bank offered $89 million to settle claims that it had abused the foreclosure process. Just one example of that abuse involved the firms attempts to foreclose on the home of a 90-year-old woman who had made a 27-cent payment error. Mnuchin and his fellow investors, for their parts, made $1.6 billion in the 2009 deal to take over the failed bank that would become OneWest, and Mnuchin personally took a $10.9 million payout after OneWest merged with a different bank in 2015.

 Mnuchin was chastised in early 2017 by career ethics officials for violating laws against self-dealing when he promoted The Lego Batman Movie, which was financed by his production company.

 Earlier this year, that same federal ethics watchdog agency refused to certify Mnuchins 2018 financial disclosure after it learned that he had sold his stake in a film production business to his then-fiancée and current wife, Louise Linton. This sale came after Mnuchin signed an ethics agreement promising to divest from the company.

 Linton was a key player in a separate scandal involving the secretary. In 2017, she posted Instagram photos of herself disembarking from a military plane in Kentucky just prior to a solar eclipse, including the hashtags for high-end fashion brands that she was wearing at the time. When a mother of three from Portland, Oregon, posted a comment on Lintons Instagram page expressing dismay over the fact that taxpayers had funded what seemed like a personal glamour trip, Linton responded:

Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? Im pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day trip than you did.

What great #patriotism!

Lintons question about government-funded honeymoon travel was more than rhetorical: It was later reported that Mnuchin had requested use of a government jet for himself and Linton to travel on their 2017 European honeymoon, but the request had been denied. It was also later reported that between the spring and fall of 2017, Mnuchin had taken eight trips on military aircraft, costing taxpayers $1 million, when he could have flown commercial airlines as had been the practice of his predecessors, and with his wife as his regular flight companion. (Linton recently joked about having been described as the Marie Antoinette, Darth Vader, and Cruella de Vil of the Trump administration entourage.)

 Mnuchin managed to entangle himself in perhaps the most convoluted scandal of the Trump presidency: the Russia affair. As lawmakers left town for the winter holidays last year, Mnuchin announced a decision to undo sanctions against Oleg Deripaska, a Vladimir Putinaligned Russian oligarch at the center of the Mueller investigation. Special counsel Robert Mueller would find that Deripaska had been promised private briefings and had likely been provided Trump internal polling data by former Trump campaign chairman and current federal prison inmate Paul Manafort. But Mnuchin determined that congressionally approved sanctions against Deripaska should be significantly lessened. Mnuchin also reportedly misled Congress about the terms of the deal the Treasury Department struck with Deripaska to cut those sanctions. Mnuchin also failed to address his own conflict of interest revolving around a direct business connection to a top shareholder at Deripaskas firm. No collusion, though!

 Mnuchin was accused of using his Jewish identity to help shield the president after Trump said there were  very fine people  among the attendees of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that included participants who wielded flaming torches and chanted neo-Nazi slogans.

 Mnuchin postponed the Treasury Departments previously announced move to put abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, reportedly because he understood the change would upset the president, who is a big fan of the current face of the $20 bill, virulent racist Andrew Jackson.

How Long It Has Been Going On: Mnuchins abuse of corporate positions of power stretches back at least a decade, as evidenced by the validated charges of foreclosure misconduct against OneWest. He extended his corruption to the public sector the moment he set out to enter government service in late 2016, through his lies and withholding of information during his confirmation process, and began abusing his office in the first months after hed obtained it. His latest efforts to cover up Trumps tax returns can be dated at least back to March, when he promised that he would protect the president before the request for Trumps returns had even been made.

What Would Normally Happen: Normally, the president would just hand over his tax returns, as every previous modern candidate had done prior to Trump. Because theres no precedent for what Trump has done, its hard to think of a parallel case and a normal response. After the Teapot Dome scandal, Congress tried to solve the problem of the executive branch preventing congressional financial investigations and blocking access to tax returnsin that case, it had been Mnuchin predecessor at the Treasury Department Andrew Mellon who had come under scrutinyby passing the law saying that the secretary shall furnish requested returns. But Mnuchin is simply ignoring that law.

As for Mnuchins various conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and ethics lapses, thats also a highly unusual situation. Theres no real enforcement mechanism on those issues aside from impeachment. As the Times noted of the failure to get his 2018 disclosure certified following the revelations that he had attempted to divest one of his investments by selling it to Linton:

It is extremely rare for cabinet officials to not have their financial records certified, said Virginia Canter, a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department. In 2001, Paul H. ONeill, President George W. Bushs Treasury secretary, divested his holdings in Alcoa, an aluminum producer, because of conflicts of interest.

Of course, all of this is nothing compared with the presidents own failure to divest from his businesses, which is perhaps why Mnuchins conflicts might not matter so much to the public.

In regard to the apparent abuses of government resources surrounding the $1 million in noncommercial travel, there is some very recent precedent there. Trumps first health and human services secretary, Tom Price, was forced to resign that job for spending $400,000 on private planes for official business travel. Apparently, though, the norm that abuses of government resources might result in removal from office or resignation only applied to the first couple of Trump Cabinet officials who were caught doing that.

What Democrats Have Done: Issued stern verbal warnings, sent out subpoenas, and gone to court. None of these efforts have accomplished anything so far. Given the breadth and scope of Mnuchins abuses, the Democratic timidity in confronting him seems particularly pathetic.

That timidity is not relegated just to the House of Representatives. Shortly after she entered federal office, Sen. Kamala Harris of California struggled to explain why she had failed to prosecute OneWest Banks foreclosure violations as California attorney general back in 2013.

Senate Democrats, meanwhile, tried to vote to overturn the Deripaska sanctions relief with the support of many Republicans, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked that effort. Sen. Ron Wyden, for his part, has been harshly critical of Mnuchins various past abusive business practices and more recent violations of federal ethics statutes, but nobody has actually done anything about either of those issues.

As for the tax returns, Neal has taken a route that even many of his colleagues in the generally sheepish Democratic caucus have found to be meek. In May, after Mnuchin refused to hand over Trumps tax returns as required by law, Neal escalated by issuing a subpoena. A week later, when Mnuchin said he would not be complying with the subpoena, Neal decided not to seek to hold him in contempt of Congress, but instead simply went to court. I dont see what good it would do at this particular time, Neal told CNN, when asked about contempt. I think that if both sides have made up their minds, better to move it over to the next branch of government, the judiciary.
The case landed in front of Trump-appointed D.C. District Judge Trevor McFadden, and when Neal requested that the case be fast-tracked because of the urgency of the matter, McFadden said no.

Meanwhile, Neal said earlier this month that he hadnt determined yet whether to even release the whistleblower complaint about the alleged abuse of the audit system to the public. He also couldnt say whether an allegation of political interference in the audit process, on top of the total nullification of the law requiring tax records be turned over to his committee, on top of Mnuchin ignoring congressional subpoenas, deserved being drawn into the Democrats newly launched impeachment inquiry.

Thats hard to speculate about, Neal said. I think that certainly you believe as we go down this road, that the inquiry could entail a lot of different things. You can see, Im very guarded about what I have to say because this is an active court case. Fellow lawmakers are apparently growing impatient with Neals handling of the whistleblower complaint, with one telling the Post that Neal had been almost entirely silent about the whole matter in private meetings with Democrats on his committee.

Great work, Richard Neal!

What Is Likely to Be Done: As with the Ukraine scandal, Democrats could play their one big card and initiate impeachment proceedings against Mnuchin. They could also consider exercising their long-dormant inherent contempt powers, perhaps in new ways such as issuing fines, though such fines might be impossible to enforce and also would likely be a drop in the bucket to Mnuchin. It seems unlikely that they will do either of these things. You would think that Trumps tax returns would be a critical part of any impeachment inquiry, but so far theyre not critical enough for the Democrats to really fight for them.

One thing Democrats mightand shoulddo about Mnuchin is this: make sure he at least answers for whatever his role might have been in the Ukraine scandal. Mnuchin has said repeatedly that he wasnt on the call on which Trump pressured Ukraines president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden (Mnuchin argued against releasing the summary of that call and claimed publicly it was largely a congratulatory call before that release showed otherwise). He has, however, said that he was involved in the process of blocking $250 million in military aid to Ukraine while Trumps pressure campaign was happening. Mnuchin has further claimed there was no connection between the military aid being withheld and the pressure campaign to investigate Biden.

If House Democrats have any sense, theyll subpoena the treasury secretary for documents related to his work on the aid issue and seek to compel him to testify on the things he has already discussed publicly. Do they have any sense? Well see!",0
17,"The jailed promoter of crisis-hit mortgage lender DHFL, Kapil Wadhawan, has offered his personal and family properties, which he claims are worth Rs 43,000 crore, for repayment of outstanding loans of lenders to the company.

Wadhawan wrote to RBI-appointed administrator R Subramaniakumar on October 17 saying his offer would ensure maximum value for the assets that have been put on the block to repay loans.

Currently under judicial custody, Wadhawan has proposed to the transfer of the right, title and interest in various projects which form part of the real estate portfolio of his family to enable proper and complete resolution of DHFL and to maximise the value of the properties.

The valuation of these projects including Juhu Galli project and Irla project are about Rs 43,879 crore that to at a 15 per cent lesser market value, the letter dated October 17 said.

Wadhawan has mentioned that after the IL&FS crisis in September 2018, not only DHFL but all the NBFCs face major financial crisis and the company took various steps and repaid Rs 44,000 crore of liabilities by monetising DHFL's assets such Aadhaar housing finance Ltd, Avanse Financial, DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers and DHFL Pramerica Trustee Ltd.

On June 7, 2019, RBI issued a circular on Prudential Framework for resolution of stressed assets and the process of restructuring DHFL's debt and resolution of its financial stress began.

An Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) was executed on July 5, 2019 among the banks and some lenders. The exposure of the lenders who signed the ICA was Rs 39,000 crore.

Even today DHFL's collection has been between Rs 10,000-15,000 crore and are available to repay the lenders, Wadhawan said in the nine-page letter sent from Taloja jail on the outskirts of Mumbai, where he and brother Dheeraj are currently lodged.

Wadhawan, who is in judicial custody since April on various charges including violation of money laundering law, said, ""The erstwhile management of DHFL have made all the efforts to resolve the financial stress being faced by DHF. This letter is one more effort in continuation of our resolve.

Last week, Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises and two other entities placed bids for DHFL, the first financial services player undergoing insolvency process, according to sources.

The US-based Oaktree and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy submitted bids for DHFL on October 17, the last date to submit final bids, the sources said.

In November, the Reserve Bank referred DHFL, the third largest pure-play mortgage lender, to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings.

According to a filing last month, fraudulent transactions worth Rs 17,394 crore were reported at DHFL during 2006-07 to 2018-19, as per a report of transaction auditor Grant Thornton.

Fund diversion by the promoters of DHFL resulted in lenders classifying DHFL account as ""fraud"".

Another fraudulent transactions worth Rs 12,705.53 crore were reported by the forensic audit, followed by the third one earlier this month.

The third fraud worth Rs 2,150.84 crore, by way of undervaluing the company's insurance subsidiary, was detected by Grant Thornton.

376,"WASHINGTON  The Trump administration announced criminal charges against one of China's largest telecommunications companies Monday, a dramatic move that promises to ratchet up tensions on the eve of trade talks this week between the two countries.

Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told reporters in Washington a pair of indictments had been unsealed in two separate cases. A Brooklyn grand jury charged Huawei as a company, and its chief financial officer, Wanzhou Meng, with money laundering, bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Huawei also was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.

A separate indictment accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets from U.S. telecom firm T-Mobile. Those charges stem from a civil lawsuit filed by T-Mobile in 2014 over a robot called ""Tappy,"" which was used in testing smartphones.

""Huawei intentionally conspired to steal intellectual property from an American company in an attempt to undermine the free and fair marketplace,"" the Justice Department said in a statement.

Meng, who was arrested in Canada in December, is accused of orchestrating a scheme to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

The Brooklyn indictment says Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Meng misled U.S. banks into believing that Hawei had no interest in the Hong Kong company, called Skycom, according to the Justice Department.

The indictment also charges Huawei with conspiracy to obstruct justice by destroying evidence and moving employees out of the U.S. so they could not be called as witnesses.

Meng is a daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, who served as an engineer in the People's Liberation Army from 1974 to 1983. The U.S. is seeking her extradition.

China warns of 'grave consequences' if Huawei executive is not released

Dec. 9, 201801:27

""For over a decade, Huawei employed a strategy of lies and deceit to conduct and grow its business,"" said Richard Donoghue, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said the charges ""lay bare Huawei's alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices.""

Huawei (pronounced ""Wah-way"") is second only to Samsung as the world's largest supplier of smartphones and has been heavily involved around the world in building the next generation of cellphone networks, known as 5G. The Trump administration has been pushing other countries to exclude the firm from that work, citing security risks.

Last year, six different U.S. intelligence agencies urged Americans not to buy Huawei phones  which are virtually unavailable in the U.S. And President Donald Trump signed a law blocking federal government agencies from using most of the company's products.

Pentagon bans two Chinese-made phones from stores and military bases

May 2, 201801:40

The indictment against a leading Chinese company  and the harsh language senior Trump administration officials used to characterize its conduct  mark a sea change from the Obama administration, which was careful in how it characterized Chinese behavior, even as it secretly saw Chinese hackers siphoning U.S. intellectual property.

Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 16 that federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation of Huawei for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. business partners, including technology used by T-Mobile to test smartphones.

The investigation grew in part out of civil lawsuits against Huawei, the Journal reported, including one in which a Seattle jury found Huawei liable for misappropriating robotic technology from T-Mobile's lab in Bellevue, Washington.

In 2012, the House intelligence committee published an investigation concluding that Huawei and another Chinese telecom giant, ZTE, posed a threat to U.S. national security. The firms are essentially arms of the Chinese government, the House concluded, which aid and abet Chinese espionage and could implant spyware that could allow the Chinese government to easily intercept communications or mount cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, such as nuclear plants and power grids.

The companies deny spying for China.

American intelligence officials have long been concerned that Chinese firms insert ""back doors"" in telecommunications equipment that facilitates eavesdropping. If Chinese companies dominate the construction of 5G networks worldwide, officials fear Chinese spies won't need back doors  they will have direct access to global telecommunications.

Still, U.S. officials have not put forward hard evidence linking Huawei to spying, and critics have pointed out that American spy agencies vacuum large swaths of private information  with court orders  from U.S. technology companies.

Talks aimed at resolving disputes over Chinese technology and trade policies are due to resume in Washington on Wednesday, led by the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.",1

1017,"As the UEFA European Championship kicks off in France, the memory of last Novembers terrorist attacks on the Stade de France and other venues across Paris looms large. French authorities will be examining the previous attacks  including the January 2015 shootings at Charlie Hebdo  to secure the tournament against any terrorist threat. Even if that means disappointing fans by shutting down Marseilles famous beaches.

To start with, authorities will be thinking carefully about what kinds of attacks are possible. Both the Paris and Hebdo attacks were made using small arms. Such attacks are popular with terrorist groups, because they are relatively easy to plan and carry out, can cause a high number of casualties and effectively spread terror throughout the population. Its very likely that security forces will be preparing for the potential of a similar style of attack.

Authorities will also be wary of potential attacks by suicide bombers, like the one witnessed in Brussels earlier this year. Suicide bomb attacks are frequently used by Islamist-inspired groups, and can be carried out in different ways. Individuals may wear home-made bomb vests, or drive vehicles with explosives into places where many people have gathered.

Of course, bombs can also be planted in specific locations. But static bombs are easier to deal with than suicide bombers, as areas and stadiums can be swept for these devices. Whats more, entrances to stadiums will be tightly controlled, with strict security requirements, similar to the London 2012 Olympics.

Authorities will also be considering how to police more accessible areas like the fan zones and host cities, as these places will attract thousands of supporters on any given day throughout the tournament. France is already on high security alert, having maintained its state of emergency since November, so many of the locations linked to the tournament will be hard for terrorists to penetrate.

Attacks like the ones weve witnessed in Europe recently are not easy to carry out  they require planning, and a support network. Of course, this does not stop individuals from launching rogue attacks, like the one at [Leytonstone Tube station](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35018789) in December 2015.

But while such attacks can cause casualties  as seen in Munich last month  they cannot have the same impact as well-planned, well-resourced attacks. And fans attending the tournament can take comfort from the recent arrest of a French man who was caught transporting weapons, reportedly in order to launch an attack on the tournament.

France is deploying 90,000 police and security personnel to protect citizens. They are likely to be deployed at strategic locations, and no doubt briefed on what to look for. This can include potential terrorist suspects, which intelligence reports have highlighted as possible threats, or keeping an eye out for behaviour that looks out of the ordinary. Security cordons will also be strategically placed to maximise safety and security.

Intelligence will also play a major part in the security operation. On June 7, 2016, Europol  the EUs law enforcement agency  announced that it was directing 200 of its staff to assist French policing agencies and ensure the rapid exchange of any relevant information.

Contingency plans

The French will also be developing contingency plans, based on which responses worked  and which didnt  during the Paris and Brussels attacks. Police and emergency services will have carefully planned a series of responses, tailored to the type of attacks that are likely to occur. This will include ensuring the tactics deployed by police firearms units are suitable to address specific threats, and identifying suitable evacuation zones where people can stay safely and the injured can be treated in the event of an attack.

When attending the games themselves, supporters will be encouraged to get to the stadium well ahead of time, as the security procedure will be strict and time consuming. Further security checks on public transport systems such as the Metro are also likely. People should not be overly concerned about the large police presence; officers are there to keep them safe, as well as deal with any violence from rival supporters. The French government has also released a mobile app to alert the public in the event of a terrorist attack.

The threat of a terrorist attack is real. As the Provisional IRA said during the Irish Troubles: the state has to be lucky 100% of the time, the terrorist only once. But when you consider the proportion of attacks which have been prevented, the likelihood of one occurring is still remote.",0
216,"It took three years but a leading federal bank regulator has finally gotten tough with probably the most lawless large financial institution in the country.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, recently took action against the former chief executive of Wells Fargo in connection with the scandal in which the bank pressured employees to create bogus accounts that extracted millions of dollars in fees from unsuspecting customers.

Many observers were surprised that the OCC, not known for aggressive action, fined John Stumpf $17.5 million â the largest penalty it has ever imposed on an individual â and banned him for life from the banking industry. The agency also penalized two other former senior officials at Wells Fargo and charged five others. Among those five is Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of retail banking at Wells, against whom the OCC is seeking a penalty of $25 million, substantially more than what Stumpf agreed to pay.

OCCâs belated severity may have something to do with the fact that the agencyâs posture toward Wells is the subject of a pending investigation by the Treasury inspector general. That inquiry will likely address the failure of the agency to pursue complaints it had received about abusive practices at Wells long before the sham-account scandal erupted in 2016. The agency admitted this lapse in an unflattering report about its conduct released in 2017.

Along with the announcement of its charges against Tolstedt and the others, the OCC released a 100 page Notice which reads like an indictment. It argues that for more than a decade the bank maintained a business model that pressured employees to engage in âserious misconductâ by imposing âintentionally unreasonable sales goalsâ and âfostered an atmosphere that perpetuated improper and illegal conduct.â

The document relates in detail how that pressure worked to the detriment both of the customers who were being defrauded and the bankâs lower level employees. Those employees were turned into accomplices in a corrupt scheme described by the document as âimmenseâ in magnitude.

Also contained in the document are indications that Wells managers were seeking to cover up the wrongdoing. They pretended to monitor improper conduct by lower-level employees but were far from aggressive in that effort. The document notes that the bankâs Head of Corporate Investigations testified before the OCC that there was nearly a 100% chance an employeeâs boss would know if she failed to meet her sales goals, but the chances were very small that an employee would be caught for issuing an unauthorized product or service. Those employees clearly got the message that if they wanted to keep their jobs they had to go along with the scheme.

Unfortunately, the document is part of a civil proceeding when it should really be part of a criminal case against Wells and those who were running it. The shocking misconduct outlined by the OCC belongs in an indictment brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

There are reports that the Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Wells, but it is hard to be confident that Bill Barrâs DOJ will do the right thing.",1
705,"Florida officials recently launched the Highway Heroes campaign, which aims to involve truck drivers in the fight to end human trafficking.

Attorney General Ashley Moody and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) on Oct. 26 launched the campaign, which aims to enlist 500,000 truckers. Human trafficking, which involves the use of force to obtain labor or a commercial sex act, exploits about 25 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking.

The Highway Heroes campaign involves outreach materials, which are mailed to commercial driver license holders, and a new webpage that has resources on how to spot signs of human trafficking and report suspected crimes. Indicators that someone may be a victim include anxious behavior, malnourishment and lack of control over identification documents and money.

âTruck drivers play an important role in our fight to end human trafficking,â said Moody, who serves as chair of the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking. âBy spending so much time on the road, visiting truck stops and communicating with each other regularly, these drivers create a powerful network that can be called upon to spot and report suspected human trafficking.â

According to FLHSMV Executive Director Terry Rhodes, more than 500,000 licensed commercial drivers are licensed in Florida. As part of the program, approximately 500,000 letters will be sent to CDL holders by Oct. 30. The letters explain what human trafficking is and direct the reader to the Highway Heroes website, which contains training resources created by Truckers Against Trafficking.

TAT is a national group that educates members of the trucking industry about combating human trafficking. The Highway Heroes campaign offers every trucker in Florida the opportunity to become a TAT-trained driver.

TAT Deputy Director Kylla Lanier said Florida officialsâ concerted effort to create the Highway Heroes program represents an example she hopes other states will replicate.

As part of our #HighwayHeroes initiative, we launched a new website full of information and resources for truckers to learn how to spot trafficking, gather evidence, report the crime and become a Certified #TruckerAgainstTrafficking. https://t.co/jiYZ2q0rKn pic.twitter.com/eqBls00YMG

â AG Ashley Moody (@AGAshleyMoody) October 26, 2020

âWe are receiving requests for more materials from Floridaâs professional drivers and an outpouring of positive comments about their being a part of the solution to this heinous crime,â Lanier told Transport Topics.

Additionally, Highway Heroes will launch a digital media campaign geared toward CDL holders in Florida with messages about human trafficking. The digital campaign will run through January, which is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.

Some 12,000 miles of highway run through Florida, according to the letter mailed out as part of the campaign. According to the Statewide Council on Human Trafficking, Florida ranks third in the nation in number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.

âTruck drivers serve as the eyes and ears on our roads â ensuring everyone stays safe,â said Florida Trucking Association President Ken Armstrong. âThe members of FTA have made it a priority to train their professional drivers to spot and report human trafficking, with almost 1 million drivers having already received the training nationally. We encourage all Florida commercial truck drivers to become a certified Trucker Against Trafficking.â

Fighting human trafficking has been emphasized at the federal level in recent years. In January, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao challenged industry representatives to commit to practices that help combat human trafficking. Specifically, Chao asked for 100 pledges to combat human trafficking in 100 days, a goal that industry members exceeded.

In 2019, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced a final rule that permanently banned commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been convicted of human trafficking. The rulemaking specifically disqualifies drivers who use a truck to commit a felony involving human trafficking.",0
545,"Lamine Diack, the disgraced former IAAF president, has been ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering. It follows a four-year investigation in France into doping cover-ups, extortion and bribe-taking in world athletics.

The 86-year-old, who led the International Association of Athletics Federations from 1999-2015 and was one of the most influential men in global sport, is accused of being part of a conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for money. This conspiracy also involved the Russian athletics chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, Russias former national middle distance coach Alexei Melnikov, Diacks former aide Habib Cissé and the IAAFs former head of anti-doping, Gabriel Dollé. These four will also face trial on the same charges, along with Diacks son, Papa Massata Diack, the disgraced former IAAF marketing executive who was banned for life from athletics in 2016. They all deny the charges.

All six will be tried for their role in the case of Liliya Shobukhova, the London Marathon winner in 2010, who paid $600,000 in exchange for covering up violations in her athlete biological passport thus allowing her to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games.

According to the prosecutors, Diack and his son, who oversees a sports consulting business called Black Tidings, solicited payments from athletes, either directly or indirectly, totalling 3.45m in exchange for covering up positive doping tests and allowing athletes to go on competing.

Massata Diack has also emerged as a central figure in French judicial probes of suspected corruption involving the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games and other sports events. The judicial official says the younger Diack will stand trial for complicity in corruption and money laundering. Believed to be living in Senegal, he could be tried in absentia.

The French authorities have also been investigating allegations Diack Sr received bribes for his votes in several bidding contests for high-profile sports events. The former International Olympic Committee member is claimed to have controlled the votes of several African colleagues.

It is alleged that Diack Sr, a former mayor of Senegals capital Dakar, used these payments to fund political campaigns in his homeland, as well as a lavish lifestyle in Monaco, where the IAAF is based.",1
718,"Havana, Oct 6 (Prensa Latina) President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel recalled today the attack against a Cubana de AviaciÃ³n aircraft in mid-flight 44 years ago, which he described as a cowardly and cruel act supported by the United States.

In his Twitter account, the Cuban president affirmed that before this event, known as the Crime of Barbados, which cost the lives of 73 people, Cubans cried indignantly, but also ratified their conviction of sovereignty and did not surrender.

The standing Revolution is the worst punishment for the murderers, DÃ­az-Canel reflected, who placed a link to an article published today by the local newspaper Granma, in which he recalls that the perpetrators of that sabotage died with impunity, awarded, encouraged, and under the protection of the United States.

Cuba commemorates every October 6 the Day of the Victims of State Terrorism, to pay tribute to the more than 3,400 deaths due to the attacks of the United States against the island.

In the last six decades, thousands of acts of sabotage were organized, executed, and financed against the island, as well as economic, military, biological, psychological, diplomatic, media and espionage attacks, attempts to assassinate leaders.

At least 3,478 people died and 2,999 were disabled as a result of Washington's violent plans against the island.

On April 30, the Cuban embassy in Washington was the scene of a new terrorist act, when the citizen of Cuban origin Alexander Alazo fired more than 30 shots at the diplomatic headquarters.

So far, the United States Government has not publicly condemned that fact.

897,"Your Integrity Policy Matters

Mexicoâs General Law of Administrative Accountability, set to go into effect next week, is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico and will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement.

On July 19, 2017, Mexicoâs General Law of Administrative Accountability will go into effect. It is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico or considering doing business in Mexico.

When the General Law of Administrative Accountability goes into effect, it will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement. Whereas the 2012 Public Contracting Anti-Corruption Law â the law repealed and replaced by the General Law of Administrative Accountability â was limited to the federal procurement space, the new lawâs prohibitions apply to more conduct and in a wider business context.

First and foremost, the new law broadly defines prohibited âbriberyâ as: (1) where a private party offers or gives money or another gift to a public official to cause the official to do or refrain from doing any act related to the officialâs functions; or (2) where a public official, directly or indirectly, solicits or receives for himself or another person, money or another gift in exchange for doing or refraining from doing any act related to the officialâs functions. In turn, âpublic officialâ is broadly defined as any individual that has employment, a position, or a charge of any type in the Mexican government; government majority-owned companies; public trusts; or that handles federal economic resources.

Other notable prohibitions under the new law include: using or attempting to use influence or economic or political power on a public official in order to obtain a benefit or advantage or to damage any person; using false information during an administrative proceeding in order to obtain an authorization, benefit or advantage, or to damage any person; taking joint action with other private parties to obtain a benefit or advantage in a federal, state or municipal public procurement process; participating in administrative proceedings after being prohibited from doing so due to prior misconduct; misusing public resources (material, human, or financial); and hiring current or former government officials with privileged information for competitive advantage.

The new law applies to public servants and private parties, including both legal entities and individuals. This includes companies in Mexico and those based outside of Mexico, their affiliates and their officers who do business in Mexico and have direct or indirect contacts with Mexican officials. Further, a legal entity may be liable for offenses committed by its employees or third parties acting on behalf of the entity in order to obtain benefits for the entity.

Penalties for violating the new law can be severe. Individuals and companies face sanctions up to twice the amount of any acquired benefits, compensatory and/or punitive damages and/or a temporary ban on participating in procurement, leases, services or state-owned projects (e.g., projects with Pemex). Companies further face the brand new penalties of a temporary suspension of operations or dissolution.

However, Mexicoâs new law also provides that sanctions shall be mitigated by 50-70 percent where a company self-reports past or ongoing misconduct and has implemented and enforced an adequate âIntegrity Policy.â An âIntegrity Policyâ is defined to include, at a minimum: (1) a document setting forth the functions and responsibilities of each of the companyâs areas, the leadership throughout the company and a clear chain of command; (2) a code of conduct with enforcement protocol; (3) control and audit systems that regularly supervise standards of compliance within the organization; (4) internal whistleblower and reporting systems that allow for appropriate reporting to enforcement authorities and disciplinary procedures for employees acting contrary to company policy or Mexican law; and (5) human resources policies for preventing the hiring of persons that may pose compliance risks to the organization.

Companies doing business or seeking to do business in Mexico should take action to inform themselves of the legal implications of the National Anti-Corruption System. This includes developing, implementing, enforcing and documenting an Integrity Policy that applies many of the risk assessment-based procedures and controls that are the hallmarks of a modern and effective compliance program.",0

772,"In an attack on French President Emmanuel Macronâs defense of the right to show cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which many Muslims consider disrespectful and blasphemous, Iran's supreme leader has equated Holocaust denial with perceived insults against Islam's prophet.

The remarks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei resulted in renewed calls on Twitter to add a warning label to Khameneiâs tweets or remove his account, with some saying Iranâs top authority should not be allowed to spread ""anti-Semitism"" on social-media networks.

Khameneiâs October 28 comments addressed to âYoung French Peopleâ were posted in Persian, French, and English on his website, as well as on social-media sites including Twitter.

In the short message, the Iranian leader said Macronâs move was a âstupid act.â

Macron has defended secular values following the killing of 47-year-old schoolteacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in his classroom after allowing any students who might be offended to leave.

Macron has paid tribute to Paty, saying he was ""killed because he was teaching students about freedom of speech, the freedom to believe and to not believe.""
âAsk your president why he supports insulting Godâs Messenger in the name of freedom of expression. Does freedom of expression mean insulting, especially a sacred personage?â Khamenei asked. âIsnât this stupid act an insult to the reason of the [people] who elected him?â he added.

Khamenei then compared insults against the Prophet Muhammad with Holocaust denial, which is banned in some countries, including Germany.

âWhy is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust? Why should anyone who writes about such doubts be imprisoned while insulting the Prophet (pbuh) is allowed?â

Khameneiâs tweets were met with criticism, including by Jonathan Greensblatt, the national director and chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who said, âHolocaust denialism is hate, pure & simple.â

âWhy is Khamenei allowed to consistently espouse anti-Semitism that clearly violates Twitter policy on hate speech?â added Greensblatt, who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor who escaped Nazi Germany.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center also blasted Khameneiâs tweet, saying, âNo Ayatollah, the real question is why @Twitter gives you a free pass to use their platform to push your genocidal threats of Final Solution against the worldâs largest Jewish community -- the Democratic State of Israel?â

Khameneiâs tweets coincided with a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, as well as the chief executives of Facebook and Google, were questioned on issues dealing with free speech and content moderation.

At the hearing, Dorsey was asked by Republican senators why tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump have been flagged for containing âmisleading or potentially harmful informationâ but controversial tweets by other world leaders and dictators have been not been met with action.

Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker specifically asked Dorsey about four tweets by Khamenei which, he said, glorified violence. They included a tweet posted in May that said: ""We will support and assist any nation or any group anywhere who opposes and fights the Zionist regime, and we do not hesitate to say this.""

Iranian officials refer to Israel as the Zionist regime. The Islamic republic, home to the Middle Eastâs largest population of Jews outside of Israel, does not recognize Israel.

âWe did not find those to violate our terms of service because we consider them saber-rattling, which is part of the speech of world leaders in concert with other countries,â Dorsey responded.

âSpeech against our own people or a countryâs own citizens we believe is different and can cause more immediate harm,â Dorsey added.

In 2019, Khameneiâs Twitter account was temporarily banned for reiterating a fatwa issued by the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, against author Salman Rushdie.

âImam Khomeiniâs verdict regarding Salman Rushdie is based on divine verses and just like divine verses, it is solid and irrevocable,â the tweet posted by @Khamenei_ir had said.

A Twitter spokesman said then that the tweet violated the platformâs rules.

âItâs against our rules to make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people,â the spokesman said then.

Khameneiâs Twitter account was reactivated after the tweet's removal.

In the past, some critics have suggested that Khamenei and other Iranian officials should not be allowed to use Twitter as long as it remains blocked inside the country.

Others say Twitter is one of the few platforms where Iranians can challenge and criticize comments by their leaders, including Khamenei, criticism of whom is considered a red line in Iran that has landed many in prison.

One such reaction came on October 28 from former political prisoner Zia Nabavi, who spent nearly nine years in prison after being arrested following the disputed 2009 presidential election and a brutal state crackdown that followed.

âYou cannot give guidance on freedom of expression in France when your [own] criticism in your country can result in two years in prison,â Nabavi said, without naming Khamenei.",0

Convicted

John Rigas' story is an increasingly common version of the typical American dream: from rags to riches to Federal court. Born in a rural New York town to Greek immigrant parents, Rigas was busing tables by the age of nine, joined the Army during World War II and earned a bachelor degree in management engineering, working nights at his family's small movie theater. Starting with a stake in a small cable TV franchise, the Rigas family built the Adelphia Communications Corporation, the fifth largest cable provider in the country, with 5.6 million customers in 30 states. But he was forced to retire as CEO in 2002 after being indicted for securities, bank and wire fraud; prosecutors charged him with the personal misuse of corporate funds and with hiding $2.3 billion in liabilities from investors. Rigas was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison; Adelphia filed for bankruptcy after admitting that the former CEO and his two sons had failed to record $3.1 billion in loans. Rigas, who petitioned for a Presidential pardon in January 2009 and was rejected, will be 92 years old when his sentence runs out in 2017.",1
923,"Deep Learning

Financial services have been revolutionised over the last 20 years by increasingly powerful technology such as big data analytics, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning. Now, Fintech is on the cusp of a truly revolutionary moment, the integration of AI and deep learning into financial services. This combination really has the potential to revolutionise money and the global financial landscape in ways we never could have imagined 20 years ago. This is hardly by accident, a 2015 report by Accenture tracked the global investment in Fintech; revealing it has jumped from $930 million in 2008 to over $12 billion by the start of 2015.

Data Explosion

The explosion of data over the last 10 years has been incredible, and has been so vast that there has been little way to comprehend it without intelligent automated support. As analytics advances, so does the need for increased computational power to crunch the big numbers, and AI systems are becoming easier and easier to develop adapt and integrate.

Many companies already use programs like Kasisto, a KAI powered conversational UX, to help to improve customer service and connect customers to products and services. Kasisto are currently pioneering the use of their bot to help people manage stocks and portfolios (check it out here). However, this has been around for a few years now, and it really only scratches the surface of how AI is going to transform Fintech. AI and Machine Learning is being applied across the financial world, this is the next step in financial evolution. Fintech start-ups such as Affirm, Zest Finance, and Kensho, have applied deep learning to improve decision making and financial processing. Zest Finance are redefining credit scores and challenging the use of  little data , using big data analytics to provide a much more accurate credit score than is possible in the current system.

Machine Learning Algorithms

One of the key features of emerging start-ups has been the use of machine learning algorithms to gain an analytical edge in trading. What tends to vary is the proposed clientele. For example, start-ups like Binatix are aimed more at large data sets and analytics for portfolio and hedge fund management on a wider scale; whereas Williamsburg based Inovance, is attempting to bring machine learning based trading analytics to the rescue of common investors. Similarly, earlier this year, Alpaca (deep learning Fintech start-up) launched Capitalico; a deep learning trading platform, that allows traders to automate their trade ideas without any programming or market investing experience.

This theme runs throughout the evolution of finance, banking is becoming ever-more personalised. Smart wallets like Wallet.ai will help you consider, analyse, price, and consider every single thing you purchase, in a way that no bank, financial advisor or human assistant could begin to attempt. Following many years of having offshored repetitive tasks to lower-cost locations, PWC have predicted that this financial revolution will lead to reshoring and localisation of banking again thanks to the falling costs of automation and AI innovation.

AI analytics can be applied across the entire financial world, the next level of disruption has arrived, and it spells the end for banking as we know it. In the coming years we will see deep learning infiltrate identity authentication, portfolio construction, automated investment, fraud detection, and transactional safety; not a stone will lay un-turned in the financial world. PWC has predicted that the next three to five years are likely to lay the foundations, with modest, evolutionary gains, followed by rapid expansion as the technology becomes cheaper, more widely available, and more accepted by the general populace. The partnership of deep learning and Fintech is still very young, who knows where it could take us?",0
715,"or BoA (NYSE: BAC), one of the largest US banks in terms of total assets and scope of operations, has noted that the month of October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month.

The BoA, which recently reported that around 97% of its transactions are being processed via digital platforms (a significant number), has said that itâs proud to support the National Cyber Security Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as they work toward helping US residents âstay safer and more secure online.â

The BoA confirms that ensuring security on its platforms remains a top priority for the institution. The bankâs official website points out that the the most common types of online scams are usually carried out by sending fake emails, text messages, voice calls, and letters. In some cases, there might even be someone who can show up at peopleâs homes, unexpectedly.

The BoA notes that there are many different scamming techniques that fraudsters may use. The bank goes on to list some of these techniques (which may have been used before), For instance, the scammer may tell the victim that they should not trust Bank of America, âor to respond to questions in untruthful ways.â In many cases, the fraudsters may also put a lot of pressure on people to send them money.

Scammers can also issue threats that the victim could get in trouble with law enforcement if they donât make a payment (which actually they donât even owe). Online criminals can also put pressure on people or try to convince them to buy fake gift cards and even offer them bogus codes as a form of payment.

(Note: for more details on how scammers are targeting people who use digital financial services, check here.)

Companies across the globe are taking measures to prevent online fraud, which has become one of the most pervasive problems in the digital age.

As reported recently, Mastercard is now asking businesses to upload company logos to Ethoca, a fraud prevention platform, to improve the dispute resolution process.

1038,"Financial technology leaders in New York City are keeping calm after learning that Prosper Marketplace lent over $28,000 to the husband and wife who earlier this month killed 14 people in an act of terrorism in San Bernardino, California.

Initially, the unwitting role Prosper played in the terror attack raised a number of concerns in the financial community about whether the loan was evidence of a lax regulatory environment surrounding this new breed of startups that quickly puts borrowers directly in touch with non-bank lenders.

It will definitely be a headline that will be used, Im sure, said Hans Morris, founder of Nyca Investment Capital and a past president of Visa. For my standpoint, it doesnt change the regulatory framework. You have to follow the rules and thats the story.""

Speaking at an industry breakfast this morning in Manhattan, Morris joined others on the panel who argued that existing regulations imposed on traditional banks and startups alike are sufficient. What worried other panelists though is that a push to increase the depth of background checks for loans might eventually violate a potential borrowers right to privacy.

Prosper is a San Francisco-based lender that's raised $354 million venture capital to help borrowers find loans from nontraditional sources. The company lets its lenders browse loan applications, find listings they find desirable, and make loans as small as $25.

On Nov. 18, two weeks before the deadly attacks in San Bernardino, the company loaned over $28,000 to 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers. After performing its due-diligence the loan was originated by Salt Lake City-based Webbank.com, an online-only bank that specializes in originating loans for peer-to-peer transactions, including those arranged by publicly-traded Lending Club (NYSE: LC).

Prosper's role was revealed this week after authorities reported a large deposit had been made to Farook's bank account shortly before the attack. The loan has put not just Prosper on the defensive, but also other alternative lenders who are examining their own lending procedures.

At this morning's breakfast planned before the Dec. 2 attacks took place, Morris and several New York City-based financial technology founders weighed in on the question of whether marketplace lenders need additional oversight. The consensus was that the level of regulation marketplace lenders were expected to follow was at least equal to that of banks.

David Klein, cofounder and CEO of marketplace lending platform CommonBond, said his firm has a multi-tiered identification verification process on all its loans and that every marketplace lender is subjectin principleto the same regulatory requirements.

But in a conversation after the breakfast, he explained that in reality, regulatory considerations are more nuanced across different asset classes. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has student loan examination guidelines that are subtly different than those for mortgages, cars, and other types of loans.

For someone who intends to take out a loan for an illicit or illegal act the most likely type of loan is a personal loan which is generally dispersed directly to the recipient. Other loans for education or to refinance are disbursed directly to the school or existing lender respectively. So a lot of the fraud detection is already build in, said Klein

And so, it's for personal loans that marketplace lenders like CommonBond require verification above that of even many traditional banks by requiring a borrower's bank account information. The data is cross-referenced with third-party databases like account aggregators Yodlee or Plaid to make sure everything matches up.

At this stage of the investigation many of the details of the loan have not been released to the press, including what type of loan was given. According to Klein, The only answer weve been able to find so far is that everything was done by the books and whether this happened at Prosper or JP Morgan, you would have the same outcome, he said.

Alex Sion, co-founder of alt-banking company Moven, said his consumer-focused company actually requires a higher barrier to entry than a traditional bank to get a credit card. Most of us do more than physically centered lenders or banks, said Sion, who is also the company's president. It would be a bad place if we got to this point where were starting to question digital progress because of one incident.

Up until this attack, the conventional wisdom surrounding how terrorists got funds for their acts focused on traditional banks, old-fashioned gold and cutting-edge cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In March, the House Committee on Financial Services announced the creation of a bipartisan task force to investigate terrorism financing with a goal to shut down illicit banks. Then in May, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a report suggesting that terrorists were moving to gold as a result of clamping down on traditional banks.

And last month, after terrorists connected to the Islamic State (ISIS) mounted coordinated attacks in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, the European Commission released a memo outlining plans to assess the role bitcoin may have played, according to a Coinbase report. Earlier this week finance ministers in the European Union announced plans to create centralized bank-account registers to make it easier for police to investigate terrorist funding in traditional banks.

Klein's biggest concern is that those in the United States who want to see deeper background checks might push for an increased level of scrutiny that could eventually lead to privacy violations. If there's a way to increase security that doesn't violate the principles and philosophy of this country Klein says he welcomes change. Otherwise, regulators inspired by this event should tread lightly.

""Do you, do I, do we want the government to look at our Google searches?"" he asked. ""You could argue they do right now  but use Google searches for credit decisions? I think in this country in particular, thats a really slippery slope and thats what I think makes this question a good question to ask. My hope is that it goes in a positive and productive direction.""

Already today, The House Financial Services Committee began an inquiry to look into whether marketplace lending needed additional regulation, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Jon Stein, CEO of New York City-based robo-advising firm Betterment, closed out the panel by shifting the focus away from financial regulation altogether.

I would see it as a real lack of leadership,"" Stein said, ""and a lack of good vision and narrative if what we took away from this was that the problem is access to capital, rather than the access to firearms.""",0
307,"South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabweâs former first lady Grace Mugabe in relation to an alleged assault on a woman in a hotel in Johannesburg last year.

Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of beating the âhell outâ of her with an electrical extension cord in a room at the Capital 20 West hotel in Johannesburgâs Sandton district. After the alleged assault came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity. That immunity was overturned by a court this year after Engels, a model, challenged the decision.

âI can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,â said Vishnu Naidoo, a spokesman for South Africaâs police service. He said police were seeking Interpolâs help to enforce the warrant.

There was no immediate comment from Grace Mugabe.

The two countries have an extradition agreement, but Zimbabweâs deputy minister for information, Energy Mutodi, told Reuters that Harare would not extradite Mugabe.

âI believe the government of Zimbabwe will not tolerate any harassment or degrading treatment on the former president Mugabe and his immediate family members,â Mutodi said, adding that he would need to consult with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on a final decision.

Grace Mugabe, 53, was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband, Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year.

She has denied assaulting Engels with an extension cord, saying an âintoxicated and unhingedâ Engels attacked her with a knife after going to see the Mugabeâs sons at the hotel. The South African advocacy group AfriForum, which represented Engels, has accused Mugabe of lying.

Mugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted. Elections in August were won by Mnangagwa, his former righthand man in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

The warrant comes days after a long-awaited report into the killing of six people by soldiers during a post-elections protest in Harare. On Thursday, opposition figures dismissed the inquiryâs findings as âan effort to whitewash the killing of innocent livesâ.

Set up by Mnangagwa, the inquiry found that the military and police were responsible for the deaths, but that the deployment of troops had been lawful after the police had been overwhelmed by protesters. The protests were âpre-planned and orchestratedâ and leaders from the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had incited violence, the report added.

It recommended that soldiers should face âinternalâ disciplinary measures if found to have broken their codes of conduct.

Jacob Mafume, a spokesperson for the MDC, described the inquiryâs conclusions as âbizarreâ, telling the Guardian: âThey say itâs the MDC that incited violence yet blame the military for shooting the people.â

Opposition leaders have denied the charge of incitement.

The violence followed relatively peaceful elections and caused significant political difficulties for Mnangagwaâs government, which has made strenuous attempts to convince the international community that Zanu-PF has forgone the repression and brutality it was accused of during its 38 years in power under Mugabe.

The inquiry spent three months investigating the circumstances surrounding the shootings, interviewing dozens of witnesses.

Despite widely published photographs and video footage that showed members of the Zimbabwean army firing on people, generals said under oath they did not believe troops had shot at people.

Brig Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the elite presidential guard, told a hearing investigating the killings that âif any gunshot wounds were sustained by the victims, it was not from my menâ.

Mnangagwa said his government would study the report before deciding on its next steps.",1
909,"CNA).- Two decades after the enactment of a landmark anti-trafficking law, the threat has evolved during the current pandemicâand so too, must the response, says the congressman who wrote the law.

âWeâve got to make sure that thereâs a continued prioritization of all the law enforcementâfrom the cop on the beat, to the prosecutors, to the U.S. attorneysâto make this a priority,â said Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), author of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, in an interview with CNA.

Smith is also the special representative on human trafficking issues to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, an international body of legislators from 57 member states that promotes security through dialogue.

During the new coronavirus pandemic, he warned, children are more vulnerable than before to being trafficked, and survivors are at greater risk of being re-trafficked.

âIn talking to the NGOs, the Catholic Church, others, they know that there has been a very serious increaseâand law enforcement backs this up as wellâin grooming of children online,â Smith said.

With children at home more often during lockdowns or partial lockdowns, predators try to contact them online. âThat becomes a process of exploitation that ends with rape and other kinds of heinous activity,â Smith said.

âThese people who do it know how to manipulate the mind of a child.â

Also as a result of the pandemic, trafficking survivors may have less access to the help they need if the operations of NGOs and charities are restricted because of public health orders, or a lack of donations. Shelters or employment programs might not be available. Jobs that once helped victims get back on their feet may not exist in the current economic climate.

âTheyâre very susceptible for being re-trafficked,â Smith said of survivors.

Smith authored the TVPA, which was signed into law 20 years ago on Oct. 28. Although the Mann Act had prohibited prostitution and unlawful sexual behavior across state or country borders, there were âno prosecutions whatsoeverâ for human trafficking at the time before the TVPA, Smith said.

The public was also not fully aware of the scope of the problem. Smith recalled talking to U.S. attorneys about trafficking, but they would think he was referring to drug trafficking.

Some people thought the issue of sex trafficking to be just a âvice,â without considering the abuses inflicted upon women and children. There was a âvery antagonistic view toward prostitutes and prostitution,â Smith said, ânot realizing, I believe, that so many of those women are coerced into that profession.â

His law not only beefed up prosecution of traffickersâestablishing punitive sentences up to life imprisonment, and asset confiscationâbut effected a âsea changeâ in how trafficking victims were treated under the law, he said.

Under the TVPA, minors with at least one commercial sex act were considered sex trafficking victims and could not be prosecuted. If âforce, fraud, or coercionâ against an adult were established in a trafficking case, those adult victims could not be prosecuted either.

Furthermore, the law had a comprehensive approach to fighting trafficking. It both punished perpetrators, and set up what Smith calls a âwhole-of-governmentâ strategy including funding protection for victims, and prevention programs.

It reauthorized the Violence Against Woman Act, for instance, and doubled funding under the law for womenâs shelters, rehab programs, and housing and other initiatives for battered and abused women. It set up a national hotline for victims to report and get connected to help, and created a whole new asylum category, the âT Visa,â for trafficking survivors to come to the U.S. temporarily.

With trafficking occurring across international borders, the TVPA established an office at the State Department for monitoring other countriesâ records on fighting trafficking, and holding them accountable.

In the 20 years since the lawâs enactment, there have been thousands of trafficking prosecutionsâincluding some recent notable ones.

Charges made in 2019 against investment banker Jeffrey Epstein were under Smithâs TVPA. âSmallvilleâ actress Allison Mack and NXIVMâs Keith Raniere were charged under the TVPA for running a sex trafficking ring.

âWe could always do better, no doubt about it,â Smith said of increasing prosecutions, âbut the key is a serious and sustained effort to, wherever there is a pimp thatâs cruelly mistreating a woman, we go after him. And we stop him. And we put him behind bars for a very, very long periods of time.â

On Oct. 27, Raniere was sentenced to 120 years in prison for sex trafficking and racketeering.

The next day, deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen looked back on the enactment of the TVPA on its 20 th anniversary.

âIt is important to look back at the coordinated efforts that produced the TVPA,â he said, âa collaboration of survivors, civil society advocates from faith-based groups and across the political spectrum, and policymakers.â

That collaboration, Smith told CNA, was critical in the fight against trafficking the past two decades. Federal agencies have come together with leaders of faith communities and NGOs, and local and state prosecutors and law enforcement âto all get on the same page for combatting this.â

âThat approach, I think, still is a good one,â he said.",0
579,"Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four others were arrested and charged Tuesday as part of a $60 million racketeering and bribery probe that investigators called the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme against the people of the state of Ohio.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio David DeVillers announced the arrest of Householder, a Republican, and four codefendants as part of a year-long investigation into public corruption and bribery tied to legislation that bailed out two nuclear power plants in the state.

These allegations are bribery, pure and simple, DeVillers said during a press conference. This was quid pro quo, this was pay to play.

Along with Householder, former Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth were also arrested in connection to the investigation.

Householder has been speaker since 2019 after previously having the position from 2001 to 2004. He left office due to term limits but rejoined the House in 2017. He is seen as one of the most powerful and influential state lawmakers in Ohio.

The allegations have rocked the state's political scene, with Ohio GOP Gov. Mike DeWine calling for the speakers resignation on Tuesday.

Because of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to effectively lead the Ohio House of Representatives; therefore, I am calling on Speaker Householder to resign immediately, DeWine said. This is a sad day for Ohio.

While neither DeVillers nor FBI Special Agent Chris Hoffman would go into detail about the case, it is known that Householder was one of the driving forces behind a roughly $1 billion financial rescue for Ohios two nuclear power plants, which appeared to be tied to several targets of the investigation. The legislation added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.

Previous attempts to bail out the nuclear plants had stalled in the legislature before Householder became speaker. Months after taking over, he rolled out a new plan to subsidize the plants and eliminate renewable energy incentives. The proposal was approved a year ago despite opposition from many business leaders and the manufacturing industry.

Generation Now, a group that successfully fought an effort to put a repeal of the bailout law on Ohios ballot, was charged as a corporation in the case.

FirstEnergy Corp., whose former subsidiaries owned the plants, donated heavily to Householders campaigns and his backers in the Ohio House. The utilitys political action committee contributed $25,000 to Householders campaign in 2018, according to an analysis by Common Cause Ohio, a government watchdog.

The defendants appeared in court and were not required to enter a plea. The judge ordered Householder released on his own recognizance and directed him not to obtain a passport, to restrict his travel to the southern half of Ohio and not to contact any other defendants. The judge also ordered him to remove any guns from his home.

Similar restrictions were imposed on Longstreth. The next hearing was tentatively set for Aug. 6.

This is the first time a racketeering charge has been used on a public official in the Southern District of Ohio, Hoffman said, during the press conference. When lawmakers act as criminals, the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys Office are there and watching for it.

Despite the arrests of Householder and his codefendants, DeVillers said the racketeering investigation is far from over and that it will now move into a public phase.

As of this morning there are a lot of FBI agents knocking on doors, there are a lot of FBI agents asking questions, fulfilling subpoenas, he said. This is by no means over, we are going to continue this investigation.

This is also not the first time Householder has been investigated for questionable practices.

At the time he left office, he and several top advisers were under federal investigation for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government closed the case without filing charges.

Householder is the second Ohio House speaker to come under investigation in just over two years.

Former Republican Speaker Cliff Rosenberger was investigated in 2018 amid an FBI inquiry into his travel, lavish lifestyle and a condo he rented from a wealthy GOP donor. Rosenberger, who has maintained he broke no laws, has not been charged, but the investigation remains open.",1
671,"The issue of economic crime recently made the front pages of the UKâs newspapers, when an investigation carried out by investigative journalists shone a light on the role of certain global banks in money laundering.

This has helped re-emphasise the important fight that government and society has against economic crime generally, and money laundering particularly as the government looks to develop its response to how it deals with economic crime.

In July last year, the UK government unveiled its Economic Crime Plan (ECP) 2019 to 2022, which set out the action being taken by the public and private sectors to ensure the UK has a world leading response to this challenge.

The ECP sets the agenda for economic crime reform in the short-to-medium term and is billed as a 'step-change' response, utilising the experience, capabilities and resources of the public and private sectors.

To help fund a number of the initiatives in the ECP, the government announced an economic crime levy on the anti-money laundering (AML) regulated sectors. The government hopes to introduce the levy by 2022/2023 and is looking to raise Â£100 million a year to help tackle money laundering.

A consultation was launched in July and sought views on how it could operate in practice, its design principles and to ensure it is effective and proportionate.

Whist the legal profession has an important role to play in the AML regime and we support the government focus on ensuring the UK has a world leading AML regime, we strongly oppose the levy.

Tackling money laundering benefits society as a whole, but rather than placing an additional tax on those already funding the fight against AML, additional funding should come from the public purse and other sources such as the assets recovered from criminals and AML fines on the regulated sector.

In the event that the government decides to move forward with its plans, we have argued strongly against calculating the levy on the basis of revenue because that has no bearing on the risks a firmâs work poses. Instead, we have argued strongly for a model based on the number of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) a firm submitted the previous year which would be simpler, cheaper to operate and fairer than a revenue-based levy.

We have also argued strongly for an exemption for small firms with revenue of less than Â£10.2 million a year which would see thousands of small firms being exempt from paying the levy. High streets firms are already facing unprecedented the challenges due to Covid-19 and having to pay another levy on top would be completely inappropriate.

The consultation has now closed, and we expect the government to announce the outcomes early next year. In the meantime, we continue to ensure the legal professions views on the issue are well presented with government officials, ministers and wider stakeholders.",0
472,"A former Mexican military leader pleaded not guilty Thursday in Brooklyn federal court to drug trafficking and money laundering charges alleging he took bribes to help drug cartels avoid prosecution.

Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, 72, nicknamed El Padrino, or the Godfather, allegedly helped leaders of the violent H-2 cartel move cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the U.S., including New York, according to the indictment.

In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartela cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murderto operate with impunity in Mexico, wrote prosecutors in a court filing.

The general, who led the countrys army for six years under former President Enrique Pena Nieto, was with his family when he was nabbed in October at the Los Angeles International Airport.

From 2012 to 2018, he oversaw the Mexican Army and the Mexican Air Force, reporting directly to the president  all while he was secretly communicating with the cartels most senior leaders, prosecutors allege.

Cienfuegos endured a major scandal in 2014 after soldiers under his command killed 22 suspects at a grain warehouse  at least eight of whom were executed after they surrendered, according to a human rights investigation.

Hes due back in court on Nov. 18.",1

730,"In late September, Joe Tone, the young editor of the Dallas Observer, broke the news to his staff that they would soon be moving offices. But they wouldnât be going far, just four floors down in their building on the corner of Oak Lawn and Maple. In his pleasant, Midwestern way, he explained that the paper was moving to distance itself from Backpage.com, the classified ad site owned by the Observerâs parent company. That company, Village Voice Media, was based in Phoenix, but Backpage.com, which has been associated with prostitution and underage sex trafficking, was based right here in Dallas, where it ran operations just down the hall from Toneâs office.

In a blog post that went live at 12:14 am on Monday, September 24, he offered more details about the move: âThe longtime owners of the Dallas Observer have sold the paper and its 12 Village Voice Media sister publications to a group of VVM executives, creating a new holding company and cutting ties with Backpage.com, the controversial classified advertising company. So: we have new owners, but the same old bosses.â The new company, based in Denver, is called Voice Media Group.

The âlongtime ownersâ Tone referred to are Mike Lacey and his business partner Jim Larkin, who founded Phoenix New Times in 1970 and grew it into Village Voice Media, the nationâs largest chain of alternative weeklies. (Disclosure: I worked as a staff writer for VVM for three and a half years.) Lacey is a charismatic but prickly man, known for his colorful language, his love of Scotch, and his unwillingness to back down from a fight. He once went to jail as part of a long battle against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

But it seemed the prostitution ads on Backpage.com, which have run in the Observer for years, had generated too much bad press and forced too many national advertisers to sever their ties with VVM. âBackpage.com has been a distraction, thereâs no doubt about it,â Scott Tobias, head of the new Voice Media Group, told the Wall Street Journal. But the site was also too profitable to let go. The âadultâ section of Backpage.com brings in an estimated $22 million a year. It appeared Lacey had decided to get out of the journalism business in favor of the sex business. He cast the move in different terms. In the few interviews he did after the separation announcement, he said his decision to sell the papers but keep Backpage.com was a âFirst Amendment issue.â

Backpage.com started in 2004. Itâs the brainchild of a former Observer classified ad salesman named Carl Ferrer, a shadowy figure who cannot be seen or interviewed by reporters. (Liz McDougall, general counsel for Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC, would confirm nothing about the creator of Backpage.com, even his name, saying itâs for his own safety and âso he can focus on the business.â) The site is a person-to-person marketplace, similar to Craigslist. Backpage.com offers an adult section, with categories such as âescorts,â âbody rubs,â âstrippers & strip clubs,â and âadult jobs.â While plenty of the ads are placed by willing, adult women, the site has also been used by pimps to peddle women, some of them underage.

When Craigslist shut down its adult listings in 2010, after a serial killer used the site to lure victims, Backpage.com thrived, eventually accounting for a reported 70 percent of all prostitution ads in the country. There are now listings for every state in America and for countries on every continent except Antarctica.

The trouble for Backpage.com really began earlier this year, when New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote a series of articles excoriating the site. Kristof, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting on human rights violations in China and genocide in Africa, documented the case of a girl who had been sold as a sex slave on the site when she was 16 years old. Then he pressured VVMâs financiers (including Goldman Sachs) and national advertisers (including Warner Bros., Disney, and Target) to cut ties with the company until Backpage.com agreed to remove the escort ads.

Representatives from VVM tried to make the case that removing the ads would drive the online escort business underground and offshore, making it even more dangerous for the women and children most at risk. But a national campaign sprang up with an online petition that collected 200,000 signatures from people demanding that the ads come down. A website called Village Voice Pimps began documenting dozens of sex trafficking cases nationwide that involved Backpage.com. Activists emailed media outlets across the country with lists of local advertisers that had agreed to stop placing ads in VVM papers.
The company felt the pinch, and by the end of the summer, VVM was laying off writers across its chain of papers.

When the sale of the papers was announced, something strange happened. The management buyout, readers were told, was backed by a private equity fund. But how much money was involved and, more important, who was involvedâthose details were kept private. If VVM was losing ad revenue because of its ownership of Backpage.com, then it stands to reason that part of the value of the fundâs investment in the weekly papers lies in recapturing that money. And the best way to do that would be to make it plain that the new owners are, in fact, new. Shrouding the private equity fund in secrecy only invites speculation. Andrea Powell, the executive director of FAIR Girlsâan organization that helps at-risk girls, including some trafficked on Backpage.comâhas called the sale âa smoke-and-mirrors effortâ on national television. Too, it is rare for media outlets to not reveal their ownership simply because every hard-hitting story would be open to the criticism that it was written to further the interests of a secret, faceless owner.

Before the split, VVM tried to make its case to outside reporters. Now the entire organizationâboth sides of itâhas become tight-lipped. Through their attorney, Lacey and Larkin have declined interviews. Tone said he couldnât comment, instead deferring to a public relations woman in New York; she would only say that all the financials are âa private matter.â Tobias, who is in charge of the Observerâs new ownership group, would only answer questions over email. When asked why his company isnât being transparent about its new sources of income, he replied with a canned statement that read, in part: âThis was a business decision involving two companies who realized they have two separate missionsâone in news and entertainment and one focused exclusively in digital classifiedsâand both are better off focusing on those separate missions.â

Interestingly enough, hours after the split was announced, Village Voice Pimps posted some new information on its site. The group had found the trademark registration for the new Voice Media Group logo. It was registered in Julyâtwo months before the saleâto Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC. That means the logo of the new supposedly independent company is owned by Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.

Thereâs also this: for all the things Lacey is known forâthe drinking, the rabble-rousingâthe 64-year-old multimillionaire is also known for the ink on his hands. Across his knuckles are tattooed the words âHOLD FAST.â",1
491,"INGs subsidiary Payvision has been hit with accusations of supporting fraud and massive money laundering by the European Funds Recovery Initiative (EFRI).

In a detailed story EFRI comments: In our opinion Payvision is Netherlands Wirecard  a company helping scammers in big style fraud.

Fintech Direct contacted Payvision and EFRI on 4 November for the paytechs response and to look at the evidence, which EFRI was offering to the press. Neither replied.

Payvision enables online shops to accept credit card payments and acts as acquiring partner for merchants. ING acquired 75% of the shares in the paytech in spring 2018 at a valuation of 360 million.

EFRI explains that in January 2019 the Austrian and German law enforcement agencies arrested Uwe Lenhoff and charged him with fraud for being the beneficial owner of the boiler room scams Option888, ZoomTraderGlobal, Tradovest and Lottopalace, which ripped off thousands of unsuspecting European consumers. In July 2020, Lenhoff was found dead in his cell in Saarbrücken, Germany.

Gal Barak was arrested in Sofia, Bulgaria  where he operated boiler rooms and the investment scams xtraderFx and OptionStarsGlobal. He was found guilty in September this year for fraud and money laundering and sentenced to four years in jail in Vienna.

Based on the statements of these two accused and Rudolf Booker (Payvisions former CEO), EFRI says it is proven that the stolen money from the [various] boiler room scams were processed via Payvision from 2015?.

In December 2018 Payvision terminated the contracts due to negative public reporting about the fraudulent systems on the Fintelegram website.

According to EFRI, the companies attributed to Lenhoff and the platforms generated a total turnover (stolen money) of 55.6 million. The companies and platforms attributed to Barak show a total turnover of 75.6 million with Payvision.

EFRI notes: There had already been warnings published by various financial market supervisory authorities against the fraud schemes from Uwe Lenhoff and Gal Barak from 2016 onwards, but Payvision ignored all of them.

In September 2019 ING bought the remaining 25% share in Payvision. EFRI has something to say about that as it reckons ING must have known already about the kind of business Pavision was in, so they rewarded Booker and his partners with even more money.

EFRI adds: At the same time hundreds and thousands of unsuspecting European consumers have suffered from having been ripped off and having lost their life-time savings to scammers with the support of Payvision.

In terms of action, EFRI filed a money laundering complaint against Payvision in summer 2019 (except for a receipt confirmation, no response has been received from the relevant authorities).

It is about to send an updated version to the Dutch central bank. EFRI says it is also preparing legal steps against Payvision.

There will probably be more updates as this story develops.

419,"A data leak from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda, sheds light on the business and real estate empire of Nenad Popovic, a Serbian minister found to be worth at least US$ 100 million  and possibly higher.

Appleby declared Popovic as Politically Exposed Person or PEP and a high risk. The firm also dug deeper into his backround and noted his connections to notorious financier Marc Rich and his companies activities in Russia. The request was never completed after being scuttled at some point by one of the parties.

By Dragana Pe?o and Stevan Doj?inovi?

The minister is widely known in Serbia as Russias man in the government. In fact, according to media, one of his first meetings after being named to his post last June was with Russias ambassador to Serbia, Alexander Chepurin.

The Serbian Peoples Party, which he founded in 2014, advocates closer relations between Belgrade and Moscow and opposes Serbias plans to join the European Union. Moreover, he built his business empire, controlled by his company, ABS Electro, in Russia.

Popovics Russia ties go back years. In 2008, he supported selling Serbias public oil company, NIS, to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned oil giant. According to his biography, he lectured at two universities in Moscow. And he recently told an interviewer that he is proud of the support he receives from United Russia, Russias ruling political party.

Popovic is minister-without-portfolio in charge of innovation and technology. It is not clear how he got the post, given that the Serbian government calls the countrys integration into the European Union (EU) a priority.

Paradise Papers

The Paradise Papers is a set of millions of internal documents and emails from Appleby, an offshore law firm, that were leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), Serbias KRIK, and 92 other media partners from 67 countries.

The papers relating to Popovic show that, despite his admiration for Russia and his career as a Serbian politician, he has been a legal resident and taxpayer in Switzerland since 2008.

They also show that he is very rich. Popovic has made no secret of his wealth, but the leak has, for the first time, made its extent clear. An audit by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers AG (PwC) discussed in the papers estimates his worth at least $75 million.

The documents show that he controls offshore companies registered in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands (BVI), companies in Russia, and property in at least three countries.

They also indicate that, while Appleby was initially eager to help Popovic manage his empire, it appeared to stall and delay finishing the job after discovering more about his history and his associates. It is unclear from the leaked documents which side backed away although Popovic has claimed it was him.

According to the leaked documents:

Popovic hired PwC to help him comply with Swiss tax requirements.
While serving as vice president of Serbias legislature in 2012, Popovic planned to reorganize his wealth using a web of offshore companies. The structure would be controlled by a Hong Kong trust and two companies registered on the Isle of Man.
PwC reached out to Appleby on his behalf in late 2012. Sergey Bezborodov, the firms senior manager in Zurich, emailed Appleby and pointed out that Popovics was an emergency case. We have a new client case for you, which will need to be handled in early January (2013) with a view to set up the structure and transfer the assets by the end of January, he wrote.

But Appleby never finished the job. The leaked emails show that, after digging deeper into Popovics background, the firm found Russian media reports tying his businesses to shady characters and a famous corruption case. He was marked as high risk in Applebys records and, in 2015, expunged from a list of clients.

Mr. P

Popovic was vice-president of the National Parliament of Serbia when the first approach to Appleby was made on his behalf.

In an initial email correspondence, PwCs Bezborodov didnt name Popovic. Later they would identify him as Mr. P, though its clear from the emails that Appleby knew who their client was.

Our client, of Eastern European origin but living and tax resident in Switzerland for many years, intends to transfer his wealth (operating companies and private real estate) into an asset protection structure, Bezborodov explained.

A document he sent to Appleby, titled Reorganization of Private Wealth Structure, showed Popovics intention to create two offshore companies through which he would control his businesses and real estate assets.

Popovic wanted Applebys expertise in setting up companies on the Isle of Man.

According to the plan, one Isle of Man company, to be called Gluna, would work through a series of Cyprus-based companies to control his businesses, most of which are in Russia. Another Isle of Man company, Salastrains, would use companies registered in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands to control Popovics real estate in Serbia, Montenegro, and Russia.

Popovic also wanted to register a trust in Hong Kong that would hold the two Isle of Man companies, but only become active and take control of them after he and his wife died. The trust would ensure that his family members would inherit his wealth after his death.

The client dislikes trusts, as during lifetime he wants to actively run the business and is not ready to give up control to a trustee, Bezborodov wrote. We therefore came up with a combined structure to meet his needs.

According to Andres Knobel, an analyst for the Tax Justice Network, these structures could be useful for two reasons: protecting assets from creditors and maintaining secrecy.

Trusts are even better for asset protection purposes than the other types of entities such as companies, Knobel said. A protector can be used to control the trustees discretion, he said.

The trusts are useful for secrecy, too. No one may know who owns a trust or what assets the trust holds, because trusts are hardly ever registered, Knobel said. Another part is that authorities or anyone else will never know [who] is behind the trust or other structures, in case the persons are involved in any illegal activity.

In its emails to Appleby, PwC described the wealth of Mr. P..

For Swiss tax purposes, we assessed the overall value of the business assets at approx. 65 million [Swiss francs] (US$ 65 million), one of the employees wrote. The true and fair market value is probably considerably higher. [Popovic] is currently negotiating a sale of a division of the business and the base negotiation price was assessed at US$ 100 million.

The company also estimated the value of his real estate in Russia, Serbia and Montenegro as at least 10-15 million Swiss francs ($10.7  $16 million).

Not Your Average Politician

When Appleby researchers began looking into Popovics history, they found a number of controversies. Their findings led them to double down and look harder.

They discovered that Popovic was no ordinary client, but rather a politician who belonged on a special politically exposed persons (PEP) list. Legally, people designated as such require more extensive investigations, as they are connected to controversial or powerful figures.

Investigators also turned up negative news articles, the leaked records show.

During these checks it has been highlighted that there are allegations that the client has not filed reports to the Anti-Corruption Agency, wrote an Appleby agent in an internal email, referring to a 2011 report by Global Integrity, an NGO that advocates for transparent governance.

The report states that three companies owned by Nenad Popovic signed 19 public contracts in 2010 and 2011, but failed to file [contract] paperwork [with the Agency].

According to Serbian legislation relating to the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA), state officials must report to the body when their companies participate in public procurement.

That set off alarm bells for an Appleby senior compliance officer, who wrote, I notice that as part of the new structure one of the (Isle of Man companies) is set to hold the clients operating companies  potentially they might be ones that were involved with the contracts that were not reported?  There is a risk for us, in that instance, that we might be involved with the proceeds of crime, he wrote.

When OCCRP/KRIK reporters contacted the ACA, the agency said that it had taken no action against Popovic because they have no knowledge that his firms have concluded contracts with the state. But, it said, two other actions had been filed.

In one case, Popovic failed to transfer the management of his companies to a third party as required of public officials. The ACA filed a case against him in 2013, but after he provided documents proving that he had earlier transferred control to Irina Kharisova, a Russian citizen, the case was subsequently closed.

Khrisova had also been designated as a director of one of Popovics Isle of Man companies in the scheme he had been planning.

A second case against Popovic, regarding alleged illegal actions he undertook while privatizing a company, is ongoing. The ACA notified prosecutors about potential violations in 2014, but no decision to open an investigation has yet been reached.

As for the one mentioned in the Global Integrity report, PwC told Appleby that Popovic had been cleared and that no formal court proceedings were taken. Appleby was still suspicious.

We appear to still have a shortfall relating to Mr. Popovics source of wealth, examiners wrote. We will need further detailed information in respect of Mr. Popovics source of wealth, the source of funds for the assets to be introduced and details of the historical business operations for Mr. Popovic and ABS group.

They were also concerned because his companies were registered in Cyprus. A particular feature of illicit money laundering activity conducted in Serbia is via investment into real estate and money flows through Cyprus. A part of this particular structure is apparently investment in property which is held by companys incorporated in Cyprus.

Russia and Glencore

In one of the emails to Appleby, PwC described the ownership structure of ABS Electro, Popovics holding company. The ABS Electro group of companies consists of a number of operating companies in Russia which are partially consolidated in a Cypriot holding company (ABS International Ltd.) or are owned through dedicated Cypriot holding companies, PwC wrote.

At one point they note that Popovic had made his fortune from state-run projects in Russia.

The main customers of (Popovics) ABS Group are large integrators who are realizing infrastructure projects for Russian state-controlled companies (e.g. RusHydro), PwC explained. ABS Electro distributes Western technology and equipment in Russia.

The biography they sent revealed intriguing details about Popovics business ties.

Early in his career, in 1995-1996, he worked for the late Mark Rich, the owner of the Glencore Group, who died in Switzerland in 2013. Popovic opened a representative office for Rich in Moscow and was president of a company that partnered with Glencore.

Glencore is a major commodity trader with a history of controversial dealings, including doing business with apartheid South Africa and trading in Iraqi oil in violation of UN sanctions. Rich fled to Switzerland to escape charges of tax evasion, racketeering, and dealing with Iran even as it held American hostages. He was infamously pardoned by President Clinton as one of his final acts in office.

Mr. Rich was previously indicted in the US for tax evasion and trading with Iran (Glencore), Appleby wrote in an internal report. It is noted that in this same period [Popovic] was apparently associated with Mr. Rich and he was also the President of Koalko International, which entered into contracts with Glencore.

Applebys research also found troubling allegations regarding Popovics Russian company, ABS.

Its subsidiary, Harvint?r, was involved in the construction of Putins Palace, an Italianate mansion on the coast of the Black Sea which had allegedly been funded by improper use of state funds, according to the internal Appleby report.

Appleby also noted another controversial Popovic connection in Russia which had been exposed by OCCRP partner Novaya Gazeta.

The newspaper reported that Popovics Harvinter was a subcontractor hired to help build facilities for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It is alleged that over half of the $51 billion used in the resorts construction disappeared, with some going to bribe top Kremlin officials who had influence over tenders.

A criminal investigation was launched into allegations that Vladimir Leshevski, an official working for the presidential administration, had received bribes, but was never convicted. Leshevskiys son worked as a director in Popovics company, ABS Constructor.

High Risk, Case Closed

In an Feb. 17, 2015 email, Applebys assistant manager told his colleague that the Popovic case can be closed.

The Serbian government did not find Popovic too high risk to be appointed minister. After he took on the role, he did report the Cyprus and BVI-based companies mentioned in the leaked documents to the state ACA, as OCCRP/KRIK reporters saw in his file.

OCCRP/KRIK journalists contacted Minister Popovic for an interview a month ago. His chief of staff answered that Popovic was on a business trip and was too busy to meet. Ten days ago reporters sent him questions which he never answered.",1
139,"John Kapoor, the founder and former chief executive officer of Insys Therapeutics, has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for the role his company played in the opioid epidemic. Kapoor is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be held liable for the increasing opioid crisis.

Kapoor was found guilty in May 2019 of orchestrating kickback schemes to encourage doctors to boost prescriptions of Subsys, a powerful pain killer. For his role in that plan, Kapoor was sentenced to 66 months in prison Thursday afternoon. Prosecutors had hoped Kapoor, 76, would receive about 15 years in prison but Kapoorâs defense team had requested only one year in prison due to Kapoorâs advanced age. When U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs announced the sentencing, she said she arrived at the 66 months sentence due to Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as ""his central role in the crime,â NPR reported, citing The Associated Press.

During the sentencing, several patients spoke about the suffering they went through after being prescribed high doses of Subsys from the doctors who were paid by Insys, the AP said. Some of the patients said the drug made their teeth fall out and also left them with memory loss. There were also stories of becoming addicted to opioids due to the doctors pushing the drug on them. One woman, Deborah Fuller, told the court about her daughter who died of an overdose at the age of 32, the AP said.

Kapoor offered an apology at the sentencing. He said he was â heartbroken by the words of the patientsâ who spoke at both the sentencing and his trial.

U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling told reporters following the sentencing that he objected to the lesser sentence.

âMy view is that the public interest demanded higher sentences for these defendants,â Lelling said, according to the AP. âThese guys basically took a publicly traded pharma company and turned it into an engine for corrupting doctors and jeopardizing the health of men and women nationwide.â

Kapoorâs sentencing comes days after his colleague, Michael J. Gurry, the former Vice President of Managed Markets, was sentenced to 33 months for his role in the Subsys scheme. Kapoor, Gurry and other Insys executives, including Richard M. Simon, the former National Director of Sales; Sunrise Lee, a former Regional Sales Director; and Joseph A. Rowan, a former Regional Sales Director; were found guilty of violating the RICO Act, for their role in the kickback schemes to boost prescriptions of Subsys, which was approved to treat the pain many cancer patients exhibit. On Thursday, Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role, NPR reported.

During the trials, the government showed that Kapoor and his sales team used data to identify practitioners who either prescribed unusually high volumes of rapid-onset opioids or had demonstrated a capacity to do so. Once they were identified, the sales team went to work to increase the number of new Subsys prescriptions, and to increase the dosage and number of units of Subsys, the government said. The kickbacks were often noted as âspeaker fees.â Additionally, the Insys team conspired to defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients, the government said. Prosecutors said Insys misled insurers regarding the true diagnosis of a patient in order to get approval for Subsys, which was to be prescribed to cancer patients.

Throughout the trial, sordid details of the methods used to persuade the prescribers were brought to light, including having an Insys sales manager perform a lap dance at a Chicago strip club for a doctor the company was trying to woo. Jurors were also introduced to a video from a 2015 sales conference of sales associates dancing with a giant bottle of the addictive fentanyl-based Subsys in a rap music video.

Kapoor will report to prison on March 5.",1
195,"A judge has told prosecutors to investigate how a drug dealer managed to rake in at least Â£30,000 whilst jailed at three Scottish prisons, reports the Scottish Sun.

Craig Sutton, 37, pushed heroin in three jails across the country, including HMP Edinburgh in Saughton.

He successfully managed to push drugs between 2015 and 2017, and was only caught after a group of users in his cell set off a fire alarm.

Prison officers were said to have smelt burning, the court heard.

The man even bragged about his jailhouse enterprise in letters and phone calls, and a judge today asked prosecutors to investigate how it went unnoticed.

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said: âA smell of burning was noticed. The cell was searched and a small quantity of heroin was found, and drug-related paraphernalia and a suspected tick list,"" the Scottish Sun reported.

191,"LAS VEGAS, Nev. â A federal jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, yesterday convicted Craig P. Orrock, a former attorney and former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee, of tax evasion and obstructing the internal revenue laws, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departmentâs Tax Division, U.S. Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich for the District of Nevada, and Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan of IRS-Criminal Investigation.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, starting in the early 1990s, Orrock, currently of Sandy, Utah, evaded the payment of his federal income taxes and obstructed IRS efforts to collect those taxes. Orrock filed federal individual income tax returns for the years 1993 through 2015, but failed to pay the income taxes reported as due. He attempted to prevent the IRS from collecting the reported income taxes through the use of nominee entities, bank accounts and trusts to hide his income and assets from IRS collection officers. Orrock attempted to evade the assessment of a large part of the income tax he owed for 2007, by concealing from the IRS both the ownership of real estate he held through a nominee known as Arville Properties LLC as well as the proceeds from the sale of the property.

From 1993 through 2015, Orrock evaded the payment of over $500,000 in federal income taxes.

Orrock faces up to five years in prison on each of the first two counts and up to three years in prison on the third count, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 26.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and U.S. Attorney Trutanich commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Burns and Tax Division Trial Attorney Erin S. Mellen, who are prosecuting the case.",1
100,"Ravindra Kishore Sinha, a former member of Rajya Sabha for the Bharatiya Janata Party's Bihar unit, recently promoted a series of misleading articles written by him through Facebook, where he brings up an already-debunked theory on SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic - being a human-made virus.

Sinha backs his theory by claiming that Japanese Nobel Laureate Tasuku Honjo had declared that the coronavirus behind COVID-19 is not natural, but human-made. In April, BOOM had already fact checked this claim and found it to be false.

While Facebook had stated earlier this year that it would not fact-check political ads, in March the company had pledged to limited the spread of misinformation and hoaxes around COVID-19. However, Sinha's political ads, openly spreading misinformation around the pandemic, have been allowed to run, with some of them still being active.

Is Someone Spreading Fake News?

BOOM spotted an Instagram post from Sinha's account, which is a screenshot of an opinion piece, titled, ""Is China hiding something?"", with Sinha's photo and his name in the by-line. The screenshot of the article, written for a publication named Business Ocean, was shared with the following caption:

""Japan's Nobel prize winner doctor has claimed that the #Coronavirus is made by China to create havoc globally. Read my article published in ' The Avenue Mail' on this matter.""

Sinha also shared the same screenshot from his official Twitter handle, stating, ""China made the #Coronavirus to attack the whole world without firing a missile,"" in the caption. BOOM, however, did not find any trace of a publication called Business Ocean on the internet, with the exception of this listing in Sulekha - a website containing details of companies and businesses around the country.

We also found a Facebook post that carried an article with the exact same headline, written for an Assam-based newspaper called The Hills Times. He writes:

""Dr. Tasuku Honjo, who is a Professor in Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine at the Kyoto University in Japan and received the Nobel Prize for Immunology, is reported to have said that this virus is man-made and that it has nothing to do with bats.""

Sinha also mentions in the article that Hanjo himself had worked in the ""Laboratory of Virology"" of Wuhan - a reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology, that has been the subject of many conspiracy theories around the pandemic.

Here are some examples of the misleading posts promoted by Sinha's page:

Sinha's official Facebook page, with over 15 lakh followers, was found to promote at least 13 different articles by various publications/websites, which carried this conspiracy theory.

Fact Check

The rumours regarding Dr. Tasuku Hanjo making such a statement has been going around on social media since April 2020. On April 26, BOOM published a fact check, debunking this rumour and putting it to rest. Here is what we found:

BOOM visited the Nobel laureate's profile on the Nobel Prize winning website and the Kyoto University website to understand if he had ever collaborated with the Wuhan laboratory. However, there is no mention of Honjo working or collaborating with the Wuhan laboratory.

We also wrote to Honjo, as well as Kyoto University. The University refuted this claim and shared Honjo's official statement, where he said said that he was deeply saddened that his, as well as the University's name was used to spread misinformation.

""At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting,"" Honjo stated.

There is absolutely no evidence supporting the claim that Honjo made any claims relating to the origin of the COVID-19. However, we found that another Nobel Laureate - French virologist Luc Montagneir, had claimed in an interview that the virus seems to have originated in a laboratory.

In The Hill Times article, Sinha wrote while referring to Honjo, ""A report of his denial was circulated in social media subsequently but it was not taken seriously by many."" He however, failed to mention that the denial was official, and that it came from Honjo himself, which was published by Kyoto University.

Furthermore, he also adds in the article, ""In the light of this and the statement of France's scientist...."", making a dubious reference to Montagnier. However, the article does not mention his name at all.

BOOM reached out to the numbers mentioned in the disclaimers of the ads ran on Facebook by Sinha's page, but did not receive a response. We also reached out to Sinha through email and the article will be updated if and when he responds.

Given that Sinha's posts are political in nature, while also carrying misleading information around COVID-19, we reached out to Facebook to get a comment on whether such posts could be allowed under the garb of political ads. The article will be updated upon getting a response.",0
529,"(Yicai Global) Oct. 12 -- Luckin Coffee and four companies embroiled in the Chinese coffeehouse chains multi-million dollar bookkeeping fraudalso fabricated millions of orders.

They overstated orders by 123 million and were involved in false advertising, Chinas markets regulator said today as it published details of more breaches by Luckin and the four others. Last month, it slapped a CNY61 million (USD9.1 million) fine on Xiamen-based Luckin and more than 40 other firms.

Luckin Coffee China and its Beijing branch, with the assistance of firms including Beijing Auto World Consulting Service, Beijing Shenzhou Youtong Technology Development and Zhengzhe International Trade Xiamen, inflated sales revenue, costs, and profit margin figures from April to December last year to gain an unfair advantage, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in its statement.

Luckin used click farming on individual and corporate purchase orders and corporate customer transaction fraud to exaggerate revenue and collectively fabricated orders, with coffee coupons, via sham deals, forged bank statements, setting up fake databases and falsifying consumption records.

The company violated Chinas Unfair Competition Law and constituted false advertising, according to the regulator, which also fined the five firms CNY2 million (USD296,386) each. The law allows a penalty of between CNY1 million and CNY2 million for cases of serious false advertising.

On April 2, Luckin announced that Chief Operating Officer Liu Jian had committed financial fraud, involving CNY2.2 billion (USD325.9 million) of transactions a month. In the same month, the market regulator set up a task force to investigate.

The fraud led to multiple lawsuits against Luckin, which ceased trading on the Nasdaq on June 29, a little over 400 days after it went public. At the start of the listing, Luckin Coffee [NASDAQ: LK] was trading at USD17. They ended at USD1.38, with an overall market capitalization of just USD347 million.",1
161,"Former Labour minister Elliot Morley has become the highest-profile parliamentarian to be jailed over the expenses scandal after he was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment for claiming more than Â£30,000 in false mortgage payments.

The 58-year-old former MP for Scunthorpe, who had admitted two charges of false accounting, was told he was guilty of ""blatant dishonesty"" and had ""thrown away his good name and good character"" in a fraud which ended ""a distinguished political career"" that spanned more than 20 years.

Sentencing him at Southwark crown court, Mr Justice Saunders described Morley's public downfall as ""tragic"".

Morley, who is diabetic and suffers from depression, had earlier wiped away tears as the court heard he had made a ""grotesque error of judgment"". He could be released on licence in four months.

""He had given honourable service to the public, not just to constituents but to the country as whole,"" said Jim Sturman, QC, defending. He had ""discharged onerous ministerial duties for almost a decade"". But now he faced ""a bleak and very uncertain future, especially at his age"".

He had also been stripped of a Â£64,000 resettlement grant he would normally receive on leaving parliament.

Peter Wright, for the prosecution, said Morley had ""engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system"".

The court was told that, between May 2004 and November 2007, Morley had ""on no fewer than 40 occasions"" falsely claimed Â£800 a month. Parliamentary rules entitled him to claim only mortgage payment interest on his second home. But while his interest varied from Â£52 per month in 2004 to Â£5.85 in February 2006, he continued to claim Â£800 a month.

He sought Â£15,200 in mortgage claims, when he was only entitled to Â£1,572. Between March 2006 and November 2007, after his mortgage had been repaid, he continued to submit the Â£800 monthly, claiming Â£16,800 towards a mortgage that did not exist.

He failed to respond to requests for further information from the Fees Office and ""evaded giving answers in the knowledge that to give truthful answers would reveal the fraud"", said Saunders.

When he was eventually challenged, he described it as an ""embarrassing and inadvertent oversight"" and immediately repaid the money.

Morley, who lost his post as environment minister in 2006, stood in the dock as the judge told him that in common with other MPs convicted over expenses, he was guilty of a ""serious breach of trust"". It was "" arguably worse"" in his case because he was a minister.

The judge was satisfied the ""excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable even in part by oversight"".

He allowed a 25% discount of the sentence because of the ""courage"" it had taken for Morley to enter a guilty plea. He avoided a longer sentence, despite claiming more money than other MPs convicted, because ""the degree of sophistication"" involved in the fraud was less.

The judge also made ""some small further reduction"" in sentence in light of Morley's public service. He had read ""a truly remarkable series of testimonials"" from many distinguished people describing him as a ""positive force for good""",1
975,"(CNN) The Trump campaign and President Donald Trump peppered Thursday with tweets and news conferences boasting of success in courts as states continue to count ballots, but the legal efforts repeatedly failed to gain traction or affect significant enough numbers of votes, if any, in key states.

Several of the active cases centered on Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, specifically, where vote counters throughout the day continued to tally numbers of absentee ballots that cut Trump's lead in the state dramatically.

Trump's few wins in court have largely been on procedural measures on issues that could affect minuscule numbers of ballots, or like in one Pennsylvania case, about relatively inconsequential issues such as allowing campaign canvass observers to stand slightly closer to ballot processers. In several courts in recent days, judges have been exasperated with the Trump campaign and Republicans' arguments.

In one case the Trump campaign filed in federal court on Thursday in Pennsylvania, Judge Paul Diamond, a George W. Bush appointee, set a tone almost immediately with sarcasm, telling the Trump campaign lawyer, ""Well, you have your hearing.""

By the end of the hearing, the Trump campaign lawyer had admitted, contrary to his initial complaint, that observers for the campaign were in the room to watch ballot canvassing in Philadelphia.

The judge asked Philadelphia city officials to confirm Democrats and Republicans were being treated fairly to watch the ballot-counting and that they were allowed to watch the counting in the city from 6 feet away. He noted the case appeared to be an appeal of a state issue -- making it completely out of place for a federal court to handle.

When the Trump campaign lawyer spoke up to say he had ""another problem"" with the ballot observation, Diamond, the judge, cut him off, asking, ""Length and width? Time and place?""

When the judge pressed the Trump campaign lawyer on if there were observers in the room from the campaign, the lawyer, Jerome Marcus, said: ""There's a non-zero number of people in the room.""

At another point, when Marcus handed the judge a hand-drawn map of the ballot counting room, Diamond cracked that the lawyer should keep his day job.

It wasn't the first sketch of a map introduced this week. In a Nevada Supreme Court case filed on Election Day, lawyers representing the Trump campaign similarly submitted a hand-drawn map of a ballot processing room as evidence -- an unusual approach in any case.

Election lawsuits filed on Election Day often have some air of informality, given the need for quick action. But several election law experts have been critical of the lack of serious legal arguments that representatives of the Trump campaign are making in recent days -- with some court filings not even containing evidence or assertions of fact at all.

In other states where the vote was still close, judges dismissed new Trump or Republican cases quickly on Thursday.

Georgia Judge James F. Bass on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed a day earlier by state Republicans to prevent the ""unlawful counting of ballots received after the election"" in Savannah, after a poll watcher for the party allegedly viewed unprocessed absentee ballots mixed in with absentee ballots that were set to be tabulated.

And in Michigan, a state court judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Trump campaign that asked for an immediate halt to the vote counting until its representatives had ""meaningful"" access to ballot counting and adjudication.

Judge Cynthia Stephens was highly skeptical throughout the virtual hearing about the lack of admissible evidence in the case and whether the campaign had sued the right party, the secretary of state.

""What I have is, at best, a hearsay affidavit that addresses a harm that would be significant,"" said Stephens. ""We've got an affidavit that is not firsthand knowledge.""

She said she was not convinced the campaign's claims could succeed in court.",0
185,"VANCOUVER â Founding Zimbabwe President, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, was reportedly toppled from power and had his life prematurely ended by a close but false family ârelativeâ who is extremely deeply involved with the occult, Spotlight Zimbabwe, has reported.

The suspicious rogue relative according to a disgruntled Mugabe family member who declined to be named, due to the sensitivity of the matter, is a well known dubious businessman in Harare, with questionable business interests in real estate, agriculture, and sports, including a stint in football management.

The Mugabe family member, currently residing outside the country said, the countryâs former president was sacrificed as a blood offering or ritual by this fake and imposter relative, who is said to be practicing satanism in broad day light.

âPresident Robert Mugabe, was not removed from power through a mere coup as we all believe,â said the Mugabe family member currently pursuing business in South Africa and here in Canada.

âAll I can say is that our president was dethroned from office through satanic means, by people we trusted and loved and regarded as relatives to the family. The particular person involved and really responsible for the 2017 coup that removed president Mugabe from office, is a man who organised the official visit of a world pop-star in Zimbabwe.â

The hurting Mugabe family member, who is back home in Harare to attend to a Mugabe remembrance ceremony, said the rogue relative who masterminded Mugabeâs political downfall and death is also allegedly responsible for the death of pioneering local business mogul, Peter Pamire, who died in a freak car accident in 1997.
Pamire was a prominent Zimbabwean entrepreneur who is credited for having been one of the first Zimbabweans to call for black empowerment, and was influential in the formation of the black empowerment lobby group, Affirmative Action Group (AAG) in 1994.

Pamire died in a car crash on March 9, 1997 after his car brakes failed him resulting in the accident which claimed his life. It is said that Pamireâs Mitsubishi Pajero developed a technical problem and overturned along Addington Lane in Ballantyne Park, Borrowdale.

There were widespread speculations that the car that he was driving was tempered with before the accident actually happened. It was also claimed that about twenty people testified on the case forcing the judge to order a thorough investigation but the investigation never took off, according to Pindula News.

âThere have been a lot of conspiracy theories about the death of Pamire, some of the speculations claimed that his vehicle overturned after he had been shot while coming from the Harare International Airport,â the news agency reports.
âIt also emerged that forensic analysts had ruled out the death being a result of an accident but were due to foul play, however the widespread rumours were unsubstantiated as there was no evidence which was brought forward. Among some of the rumours surrounding the death of Pamire were allegations that he was having an affair with the former first lady Grace Mugabe before the time of his death.â

âWeâre talking about a devil worshiper here, said the former Presidentâs family member.
âAifunga kuti takapata (he thought that we were foolish) asi ayirasa (he has lost it). Judgement day is coming. Munhu upi asinganyare (He has no shame). President Mugabe innocently visited his dilapidating mansion in Borrowdale, thatâs the occasion he used to bewitch the president. This living demon is dangerous and controls Zimbabwe from the spiritual realm. Even the current leader of our nation pays homage to him, because he was put in power by this wicked man, who Mnangagwa has even made a parliamentarian. So you might think that Mnangagwa has power, thatâs a dream, this rogue who killed Mugabe is micro-managing Mnangagwa from the spiritual and occultic realm.â

885,"Visa has launched a new digital tool to help U.S. financial institutions combat new account fraud â estimated at $10 billion a year.

U.S. cardholders currently spend an average of 15 hours to resolve new account fraud. Most financial institutions employ a layered fraud prevention strategy using multiple tools to combat identity-related fraud. However, many fraud prevention systems are rules-based, with gaps and limitations that may create customer friction or false positives.

âWith more than 14.7 billion data records breached since 2013, many of which include sensitive data such as name, tax ID number, and address, new account fraud has been a consistently growing challenge for financial institutions,â said Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group.

Visaâs Advanced Identity Score helps financial institutions make more informed identity-related risk decisions by generating a two-digit Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)-compliant identity fraud score in near real-time designed to help prevent fraud loss at the point of credit or loan application.

It uses artificial intelligence and predictive machine learning capabilities with application and identity-related data to generate a risk score for new account applications to help reduce fraud.

âAs consumers, financial institutions and merchants focus on controlling expenses during uncertain times, the cost of new account fraud in terms of money and time lost can be significant. Advanced Identity Score offers financial institutions a powerful tool to use on top of existing systems and processes to prevent identity-related fraud,â said Melissa McSherry, global head of Data, Security and Identity Products and Solutions at Visa.

Visaâs artificial intelligence examines data points in areas including application velocity (the frequency of applications within a period of time), fraud and suspicious activity and bankruptcy data across consumer identity elements. It also incorporates data from government agencies, third-party data providers, law enforcement agencies and self-reported data from consumers.",0
850,"NEW YORK â SoftBank Group Corp.âs Vision Fund 2 is investing $100 million in compliance and employee-monitoring software company Behavox, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The investment, which is in the form of preferred shares, values Behavox at about $500 million, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

The investment group will also be represented on the companyâs board, the sources added.

The deal is among the first for the second incarnation of SoftBankâs $100 billion Vision Fund. It comes at a time when the company faces growing scrutiny from investors, including activist Elliott Management Corp., amid high-profile setbacks such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.

Behavox uses machine learning and advanced analytics software to help alert companies to potential wrongdoing among employees. The companyâs customers include SoftBank Investment Advisers, as well as banks, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms.

âThis investment will allow Behavox to further focus on and invest in the needs of our customers,â said Erkin Adylov, the firmâs founder and chief executive officer.

SoftBank Investment Advisers Managing Partner Munish Varma said Behavox is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution that will make internal communications data useful to a broad range of users, from compliance to analysis of insider threats and from archiving and data governance to CRM automation.

Adylov and key employees will remain the largest shareholders in the Behavox.

SoftBank quietly completed an initial money-raising push for its second technology fund at a fraction of its targeted $108 billion, people familiar with the matter said in November. The company raised roughly $2 billion for the second Vision Fund and was still canvassing for additional money, the people said at the time.",0
906,"The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, is calling for the government to introduce a long-promised register of foreign owners of UK properties, to prevent criminals using homes as âdodgy bank accountsâ.

Reports of suspected money laundering have more than doubled since David Cameron used a speech in Singapore in 2015 to pledge that there would be âno place for dirty money in Britainâ.

The then prime minister promised a register of overseas companies owning UK properties, to make the market more transparent and prevent money from corruption being parked in lavish houses in central London.

But the proposal is still awaiting implementation. A draft registration of overseas entities bill was published in 2018, but has not yet been introduced to parliament.

Dodds will use a speech to the Labour Housing Group on Saturday to highlight the partyâs determination over the issue, and insist efforts to target money laundering should not be set aside because of the pandemic.

âWe are at a fork in the road,â she is to say. âThe Conservatives could choose to focus their energies so that people in this country have affordable, decent homes to live in. They could finally set up a register of overseas entities to flush out the criminals using our homes as dodgy bank accounts. In doing so, they could secure a quicker, fairer and more sustainable economic recovery from the crisis.

âOr they could choose to leave things as they are. Too few houses available to be homes- with prices driven up by those who use property to hide illicit wealth. I urge the Conservatives to finally make the right call.â

The group campaigns for more affordable housing.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a 2% stamp duty surcharge on foreign property owners that will come into effect in April â but it is unclear when the register of foreign owners will be implemented.

Official figures show that reports of suspected money-laundering activities to the National Crime Agency have more than doubled since Cameron made his Singapore speech.

The NCA received 14,465 suspicious activity reports (SARs) relating to possible money laundering in 2015. In the year to March 2019 that had more than doubled to 34,151.

The ease with which foreign investors can launder money through the UK property market was highlighted in the report from parliamentâs intelligence and security committeeâs report on Russia this year that warned of a âLondon laundromatâ.

âSuccessive governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London âlaundromatâ, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures,â the report claimed. âThis has led to a growth industry of âenablersâ including lawyers, accountants, and estate agents who are â wittingly or unwittingly â de facto agents of the Russian state.â

At the time of the December 2019 Queenâs speech, which set out Boris Johnsonâs legislative programme, the government promised to âcontinue to progress legislation to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the UK property marketâ.

The campaign group Transparency International said at the time that the legislation would âstrengthen our defences against illicit financial flows, as the UK seeks to attract overseas investmentâ, and called for it to be âtabled at the earliest possible opportunityâ.

Transparency International research identified 421 UK properties collectively worth more than Â£5bn that were bought with suspicious wealth. The group then checked the land titles for these properties to identify 56 law firms involved in facilitating 132 of these transactions. In most cases they were the registered address of secretive companies used to hold the property.",0

1057,"Vladimir Voronkov, Head of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said the global coronavirus crisis underscored the challenges involved in eliminating terrorism, as he presented the UN Security Council with the latest report on ISILs impact on international peace and security.

This pandemic environment raises several strategic and practical challenges for counter-terrorism, which we discussed during the Virtual Counter-Terrorism Week organized by my Office last month, he told Council members during video-teleconference briefing.

 #ISIL & other terrorist groups seek to exploit the far-reaching disruption & negative socio-economic & political impacts of the pandemic. Strengthening collective action & intl #counterterrorism cooperation must remain a priority during & after the pandemic, USG Voronkov https://t.co/mTI3Fl82Kf pic.twitter.com/sJ0qjPdfZw

 United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (@UN_OCT) August 24, 2020

Since the start of this year, the threat has grown in conflict zones, as seen by the regrouping and increased activity of ISIL and some of its affiliates in Iraq and Syria, he explained.

ISIL expands opportunistic propaganda efforts amid pandemic

In non-conflict areas, the threat seems to have decreased in the short term, with COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions apparently lowering the risk of attacks.

However, opportunistic propaganda efforts by ISIL could be fuelling an ongoing trend of attacks by individuals and small groups, he said.

Unclear, he added, is how the pandemic is affecting ISILs recruitment and fundraising efforts, or whether there is a change in strategic direction under its new leader, Amir Muhammad Said Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla. His predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed during a US military operation in Syria in 2019.

Putting a spotlight on regional developments, Mr. Voronkov said that ISIL continues to consolidate its position in some parts of the Middle East previously under its control, operating increasingly confidently and openly.

More than 10,000 ISIL fighters are estimated to be active in Iraq and Syria, moving freely in small cells between the two countries, he said, adding that 2020 has seen a significant increase in ISIL attacks in both States compared to 2019.

COVID-19 and suspected terrorists

The COVID-19 crisis has further complicated the already dire and unsustainable situation of several thousand people  especially women and children  with suspected links to ISIL. Some countries are still repatriating children, but there has been only limited progress on overcoming legal, political and practical hurdles to repatriation, he said.

The global threat from ISIL is likely to increase if the international community fails to meet this challenge, Mr. Voronkov warned, calling for decisive action from Member States on humanitarian, human rights and security grounds.

Turning to Africa, he described Islamic State in West Africa Province and its 3,500 members as a major focus of ISIL global propaganda as it reinforces its links with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara  the most dangerous group in the tri-border area of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.

While ISIL has only a few hundred fighters in Libya, it is exploiting tensions between ethnic groups and represents a portent threat capable of broader regional impact, he said, adding that ISIL could potentially expand its activities if the conflict in the North Africa nation escalates.

In Europe, the main threat comes from Internet-driven homegrown terrorist radicalization, he said. Acute concerns surround the release of prisoners with terrorist background and connections, while the rise of right-wing violent extremism means that intelligence services in some European countries are shifting their priorities away from ISIL.

Looking towards Asia, he said that ISILs affiliate in Afghanistan, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, remains capable of high-profile attacks - despite territorial losses and the arrest of its leaders - as it seeks to use the country to spread its influence across the region and to attract fighters who oppose the peace agreement between the Taliban and the United States.",0
65,"Lamine Diack, the ex-head of athletics' governing body, has been jailed after being found guilty of corruption.

The Senegalese, 87, faced corruption and money-laundering charges linked to the Russian doping scandal.

Diack was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was sentenced to four years in prison, two of them suspended.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".

Diack, who was also given a maximum fine of 500,000 euros (Â£456,928), was investigated by French authorities for four years over claims he took payments of more than 3m euros to cover up cheating.

The judge said his actions had ""undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping"".

Diack has been under house arrest in Paris since November 2015.

Previously one of the most influential figures in world sport, Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics' Federations - now World Athletics - for 16 years until he was replaced by Britain's Lord Coe in August 2015.

Diack's son Papa Massata Diack - who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 - was sentenced to five years in prison and a given a 1m euros fine (Â£913,850).

After the ruling, World Athletics released a statement in which it said it was ""disappointed this happened in our sport"" but ""grateful for the strong and clear decisions that have been taken against the individuals involved"".

Athletics' governing body added that it would like to ""reassure everyone that the reforms our congress approved in 2016 will ensure that similar actions by individuals can never happen again in our sport"".

""We are grateful for the damages awarded by the Paris Criminal Court totalling 16m euros for embezzled funds and for reputational damage suffered as a direct consequence of these crimes and the resulting media coverage,"" it added.

""As the court acknowledged, this damage has impacted World Athletics' finances and had a negative impact on World Athletics' image and reputation in a deep and lasting way. We will do everything we can to recover the monies awarded, and return them to the organisation for the development of athletics globally.""",1

434,"As is known, Yoshiyama Tanaka had also been Congress Chairman during ex-President Alberto Fujimori's regime (1990-2000).

This information was provided by the prosecutor at the hearing presided over by Judge Richard Concepcion Carhuancho to assess the preventive detention request for the other people accused of alleged money laundering offenses.

According to Perez, Yoshiyama Sasaki accompanied by his lawyer had appeared at the Prosecutor's office in order to confess.

Yoshiyama Sasaki indicated that between February and March 2011 his uncle Yoshiyama Tanaka had asked him if any of his friends were economically solvent so as to be presented as fake donors to Fuerza 2011's presidential campaign.

After telling his uncle the name of a friend, Yoshiyama Tanaka gave him US$100,000 in cash, along with the Scotiabank account numbers to make the deposits.

Furthermore, the nephew had visited Yoshiyama Tanaka six or seven times from March to mid-July 2011. On every occasion, he had been handed over between US$100,000 and US$200,000 in cash.

Yoshiyama Sasaki even confessed he had coordinated with the fake donors to deny these facts in case of being questioned by the police, or to rule out having accepted to lend their names.

Additionally during the hearing Yoshiyama Tanaka's lawyer, Humberto Abanto, informed his client has affirmed he had received money from businesspeople and then laundered it through fake campaign donations.

Judge Concepcion Carhuancho has already ordered a 36-month preventive detention for Fuerza Popular party leader Keiko Fujimori and her advisor in the shadows Vicente Silva Checa, who is considered a close acquaintance of Vladimiro Montesinos.

Montesinos was the long-standing head of Peru's intelligence service (SIN) under former President Alberto Fujimori.

In 2000, secret videos which he had recorded were televised that showed him bribing an elected congressman to leave the opposition and join the Fujimorist side of Congress.

After having fled to Japan and traveled to Chile from where he was extradited to Peru the Fujimori patriarch was sentenced for crimes against human rights and corruption committed during his term in office.

In 2017, he was pardoned by ex-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who later stepped down amid a political scandal.",1

1006,"Jose Morales was the early favorite to draw the short straw after Joe Mauer is activated from the 15-day disabled list.

But that was then and this is now.

In the Twins ' past five games, Morales has garnered nine hits in 18 at-bats. He is hitting .361 for the season.

Morales, who was selected by the Twins in the third round of 2001 amateur draft, has accomplished what other more noteworthy Twins, such as Carlos Gomez, Joe Crede, Michael Cuddyer, Delmon Young, Scott Baker, and Francisco Liriano, have failed to do thus far this season. He has not only met expectations, he's exceeded them.

This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who has followed Morales career.

Morales, in parts of eight minor league seasons, sports a .283 batting average. For Triple A-Rochester in 2007 and 2008, Morales batted .312 in 162 games.

The question about Morales has always centered on his defense. He was used at second base, shortstop, and third base in the minor leagues until the Twins decided to groom him as a catcher.

The move has yielded beneficial results, but not enough to dismiss the the reality that Morales is a defensive liability no matter which position he mans.

As a minor league infielder, Morales committed 23 errors in 98 games. As a catcher, Morales committed 41 errors in 334 minor league games. (By comparison, Mauer has only committed 14 errors in 498 Major League games behind the plate).

In 2009, both Redmond and Morales have struggled to keep opposing players from running wild on the base paths. Morales snapped the duo's unenviable streak of allowing 19 consecutive runners to steal a base by throwing out Mark DeRosa Sunday, according to the Associated Press.

Can the Twins really afford to lose his bat from a lineup which has struggled mightily to score runs?

Manager Ron Gardenhire is entertaining the risky proposition of keeping three catchers in the lineup. However, the Twins may not have to go this route if they jettison Redmond, who will turn 38 on May 5, to make room for Mauer.

When Morales isn't spelling Mauer behind the plate, he could be used as a designated hitter or as a part-time infielder. The latter isn't an ideal solution, but it would keep his bat in the lineup, something the Twins desperately need at this point of the season.",0

344,"WASHINGTON â Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated two individuals based in Indonesia for their links to the terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT). Said Ahmad Sungkar has been involved in fundraising efforts for JAT and supporting JI operatives. Afif Abdul Majid is a senior JAT leader who has overseen the recruitment and training of terrorists in Indonesia. These designations are part of the Treasury Departmentâs ongoing efforts to target these organizations as well as disrupt their financial and logistical support networks.

âThe threats posed by terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiya and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,â said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

JI is a Southeast Asia-based terrorist network with links to al-Qaida. It has been designated by the UN and the United States since 2002 and is responsible for numerous acts of terrorism including the Bali bombing in 2002, in which over 200 people from 27 nations were killed.

JAT is also an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to JI. In February 2012 the State Department designated JAT pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, while the Department of the Treasury designated three JAT leaders: JATâs acting Emir Mochammad Achwan, JAT spokesperson Son Hadi bin Muhadjir, and JAT leadership figure Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba'asyir, who was involved in recruiting and fundraising activities.

JAT seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia, and has carried out numerous attacks on Indonesian Government personnel and civilians in order to achieve this goal. Abu Bakar Baâasyir, the founder and leader of JAT, and a UN 1267 listed individual, was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2011 for his role in organizing a terrorist training camp in Aceh.

Said Ahmad Sungkar

Said Ahmad Sungkar (Sungkar) is being designated for providing financial, material, or technological support, or financial or other services, to JI and JAT. Sungkar has been involved in supporting Indonesia-based JI and JAT terrorist networks over a number of years. Most recently, Sungkar conducted fundraising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.

Sungkar previously had served as JIâs media chief. Also, on several occasions, Sungkar has extended logistics support to JI operatives seeking to evade capture and provided extremist operatives with fake documents.

In addition to providing support and services to JI and JAT Sungkar was linked to a terrorist training camp in 2010 in Aceh, Indonesia, that was under the leadership of senior JI operative Joko Pitono (a.k.a. Dulmatin) and gathered militants from various regional groups, including some with links to al-Qaâida. The militants, using the name âal-Qa'ida in Aceh,â plotted to kill U.S. aid workers and Western tourists and attack churches and Western NGOs. Dulmatin was killed in an Indonesian police raid in March 2010.

Afif Abdul Majid

Afif Abdul Majid (Abdul Majid) is being designated for acting for or on behalf of JAT. Abdul Majid since 2008 has served as a JAT leader, overseeing JAT fighters. In 2012, Abdul Majid played a role in coordinating the activities of regional JAT leaders. Abdul Majid was a member of JATâs governing council, also called the âMajelis Syuro,â from 2008 to 2013.

Abdul Majid also served as the head of JATâs Central Java branch, as of late 2011. Abdul Majid in August 2010 conducted a swearing in ceremony for hundreds of JAT fighters, some of whom were expected to take violent action against the Indonesian police. In past years, Abdul Majid headed JAT recruitment efforts for a paramilitary wing that provided training for fighters, weapons experts, and hackers.

Abdul Majid has supported training activities for terrorist networks outside JAT, as well. As of early 2010, Abdul Majid donated approximately $2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp, including weapons and ammunition purchases.

610,"Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay -- once one of the most powerful and feared Republicans in Congress -- was convicted Wednesday on charges he illegally funneled corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002, which could send him to prison for decades.

Jurors deliberated for 19 hours before returning guilty verdicts on charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in a scheme to illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. He faces up to life in prison on the money laundering charge, although prosecutors haven't yet recommended a sentence.

After the verdicts were read, DeLay hugged his daughter, Danielle, and his wife, Christine. DeLay whispered into his daughter's ear that he couldn't get a fair trial in Austin. DeLay had unsuccessfully tried to get the trial moved out of Austin, the most liberal city in one of the most Republican states

DeLay's lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said they planned to appeal the verdict.

""This is an abuse of power. It's a miscarriage of justice, and I still maintain that I am innocent. The criminalization of politics undermines our very system and I'm very disappointed in the outcome,"" DeLay told reporters outside the courtroom.

He remains free on bond, and several witnesses were expected to be called during the punishment phase of his trial, tentatively scheduled to begin on Dec. 20.

Prosecutors said DeLay, who once held the No. 2 job in the House of Representatives and whose tough tactics earned him the nickname ""the Hammer,"" used his political action committee to illegally channel $190,000 in corporate donations into 2002 Texas legislative races through a money swap.

DeLay and his attorneys maintained the former Houston-area congressman did nothing wrong as no corporate funds went to Texas candidates and the money swap was legal.

The verdict came after a three-week trial in which prosecutors presented more than 30 witnesses and volumes of e-mails and other documents. DeLay's attorneys presented five witnesses.

""This case is a message from the citizens of the state of Texas that the public officials they elect to represent them must do so honestly and ethically, and if not, they'll be held accountable,"" Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg said after the verdict.

Lehmberg said prosecutors will decide in the next few weeks what sentence they will recommend in the case to Senior Judge Pat Priest.

DeLay chose Priest to sentence him rather than the jury. He faces five years to life in prison on the money laundering charge and two to 20 years on the conspiracy charge. He also would be eligible for probation.

Jurors, who left the courthouse right after the verdict was read, declined to comment to reporters, only saying that it had been a tough decision for them to make.

The jury had sent numerous notes to Priest during its deliberations, which began on Monday. Many of the notes asked various legal questions that at one point had prompted the judge to say the panel wasn't on the right track. But at the end of Tuesday, jurors had indicated they were making progress.

Prosecutors said DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based PAC to send $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee, or RNC. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under Texas law, corporate money can't go directly to political campaigns.

Prosecutors claim the money helped Republicans take control of the Texas House. That enabled the GOP majority to push through a Delay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Texas Republicans to Congress in 2004 -- and strengthened DeLay's political power.

DeLay's attorneys argued the money swap resulted in the seven candidates getting donations from individuals, which they could legally use in Texas.

They also said DeLay only lent his name to the PAC and had little involvement in how it was run. Prosecutors, who presented mostly circumstantial evidence, didn't prove he committed a crime, they said.

DeLay contended the charges against him were a political vendetta by Ronnie Earle, the former Democratic Travis County district attorney who originally brought the case and is now retired.

Lehmberg, who replaced Earle, said the trial was not about criminalizing politics.

""This was about holding public officials accountable, that no one is above the law and all persons have to abide by the law, no matter how powerful or lofty the position he or she might hold,"" she said.

Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for Public Justice, a liberal watchdog group whose complaints with the Travis County District Attorney's Office helped lead to the investigation of DeLay's PAC, said he was pleased by the verdict.

""We can't undo the 2002 election, but a jury wisely acted to hold DeLay accountable for conspiring to steal it.""

The 2005 criminal charges in Texas, as well as a separate federal investigation of DeLay's ties to disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, ended his 22-year political career representing suburban Houston. The Justice Department probe into DeLay's ties to Abramoff ended without any charges filed against DeLay.

Ellis and Colyandro, who face lesser charges, will be tried later.

Except for a 2009 appearance on ABC's hit television show ""Dancing With the Stars,"" DeLay has been out of the spotlight since resigning from Congress in 2006. He now runs a consulting firm based in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land.",1
38,"Who Is Michael Milken?

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute. Milken was an executive at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s and used high-yield junk bonds for corporate financing and mergers and acquisitions. Milken amassed an enormous personal fortune and was indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury and eventually spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud. While he is credited with founding the high-yield debt market, he was banned for life from the securities industry.

Key Takeaways

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute.
He joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969 and started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s.
Milken was indicted and spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud.
Milken was banned for life from the securities industry.

Understanding Michael Milken

Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. It was during his time with the firm that he started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s. These bonds provide much-needed capital for companies that don't necessarily have ready access to credit. During his time at the firm, he was able to raise a huge amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. This allowed him to eventually expand his high-yield bond department. At the height of his success, Milken earned between $200 million and $550 million a year.

On April 24, 1990, Milken plead guilty to five technical counts of violating securities laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, but was released after two years for good behavior. He was also fined $600 million. Since his release, Milken has been remaking his image and is attempting to secure a pardon for the charges he plead guilty to in 1990.

Following his release from prison, he worked as a strategic consultant. This was in violation of his probation, and he was subsequently fined $42 million for these actions. In 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since then, he has devoted much of his time and resources to the pursuit of a cure for the disease.

After being released from prison, Milken was fined for working as a consultantâa violation of his probation.

According to Forbes, Milken's net worth is estimated at $3.7 billion as of September 2019. He co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation as well as the Milken Institute, an economic think tank that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.

Special Considerations

Early in his career, Milken saw an opportunity to leverage junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. He saw a way for investors to see high returnsâon a risk-adjusted basisâby buying bonds that were issued by companies with low credit ratings compared with acquiring bonds from AAA-rated companies. At the time, the availability of such bonds was limited and Milken anticipated demand would quickly outpace supply for this investment opportunity. The firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham Lambert, launched an effort to underwrite more junk bonds by convincing such companies to issue them.

The companies in question may have been early-stage or otherwise not well-established. Their low credit rating may not necessarily have been a result of poor financial health, but rather from a lack of an extensive track record to base their credit ratings on. Such circumstances are typically seen with new and emerging industries. From the companiesâ perspective, issuing bonds was a way to potentially access more capital that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue. Milkenâs efforts at Drexel Burnham are credited with launching this market.

As the junk bond market grew, Milken sought to maintain a dominant position over this sector, and some of his efforts led to engaging in business activities that eventually led to his arrest and conviction for securities fraud.",1
665,"Lawyers, compliance professionals and senior management at companies can be obsessive when it comes to the threat of criminal liability. Please do not get me wrong, I am not minimizing the risk of criminal prosecution, nor I am suggesting that everyone go out and start paying bribes overseas.

That being said, it is important to keep things in perspective. The most significant FCPA prosecutions â Siemens, Daimler, KBR, Weatherford and others â were the result of âsystemicâ breakdowns in compliance, meaning that there was little to no ethical culture or any attempt to control the behavior of managers and employees so long as they were producing, making money for the company.

A culture of lawlessness does not just spring up one day in response to the behavior of a few individuals. Rather, like a cancer, it grows and spreads, eventually taking over the organization. Such a disease can only spread in the right environment. That is, when it comes down to culture; if there is no commitment to ethics, it does not matter how many policies you have or the controls that are developed, the company will inevitably choose the wrong road.

What I have described is one extreme. If your company makes good faith attempts to design and implement an ethics and compliance program, with a commitment from leadership and the Board, chances are that the worst result you could ever face would be a problem in a country or region, especially if the country or region was acquired but never fully integrated into the home company.

For a company to be considered a âcriminal,â it has to act like a criminal â meaning secrecy, evil intent and all the surrounding attributes of a criminal.

That is why I stress two important values for a company â act in good faith by documenting everything you do and the rationale behind any action, and act transparently. Companies that adhere to good faith and transparency are not acting with the requisite criminal intent.

This is a point that is worth stressing â even in the face of significant risks, if a company acts in good faith and transparently, there is little likelihood that it can ever be prosecuted criminally.

So what about the rogue employee who does act with criminal intent, hiding his behavior and seeking to line his pockets with the benefits of bribes?

While a theoretical claim of a ârogueâ employee seems appealing, the truth is there is no such thing as a rogue employee. Everyone in the business points to Morgan Stanley as the perfect example of a rogue employee, but that is plain wrong.

In the Morgan Stanley case, the Justice Department shoehorned the facts (and ignored others) to make an important point â if you build a great compliance program and you suffer an isolated set of violations (not just one person but an office, division or region), we may decline to prosecute the entire matter.

The powerful message sent by the Justice Department was successful in energizing companies to improve their compliance programs. It was a shrewd and very effective move by the Justice Department, in a very politically risky time.

Even with transparency and good faith, companies still face risks of country-specific or regional operations that may veer off for a little while. No company will ever face a systemic breakdown so long as they have the essential two values needed to avoid a major catastrophe.

The worst-case scenario can still occur â a region or a country may have a breakdown, but those are usually detected, cleaned up and problems fixed. Companies still need to be vigilant in auditing, monitoring and conducting frequent assessments. With that recipe, companies can safely avoid any serious systemic violations.",0
535,"STL.News)  A Malden man was arrested today and charged with using stolen identities to make purchases, rent cars and open credit accounts.

Wagner Sozi, 32, was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with wire fraud and will appear in federal court in Boston via videoconference this afternoon.

According to the criminal complaint, Sozi used the names and identities of various individuals to open credit accounts, rent cars and make large purchases. It is alleged that Sozi, along with a female accomplice, opened credit accounts at an office supply retailer under various fake identities and then used these accounts to purchase Visa gift cards, resulting in a loss to the retail chain of more than $100,000. He processed these accounts via an employee of the office retailer who was complicit in the scheme. Sozi also allegedly used stolen identities to: purchase a Rolex for more than $15,000; rent a Ford Mustang convertible from Logan Airport, which he then failed to return; and rent a Dodge Charger from Logan Airport, which he then failed to return.

Sozi also allegedly possessed a Maine drivers license, bearing his photograph and the name of an identity theft victim, which was used to open a bank account and to make large purchases at the Apple Store.

The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service, Boston Field Office made the announcement today. The Massachusetts State Police and the Malden, Medford and Braintree Police Departments provided valuable assistance with the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Abely, Deputy Chief of Lellings Major Crimes Unit, is prosecuting the case.

477,"Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko has initiated impeachment proceedings against the sitting president Petro Poroshenko  a little more than a month before the two go head to head in elections.

Ms Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, made her move on the back of a new investigation that linked Mr Poroshenkos entourage to an embezzlement scheme involving the smuggling of military spare parts from Russia.

Speaking in the Verkhovna Rada  Ukraine s parliament  on Tuesday, Ms Tymoshenko said the findings were consistent with state treason.

Given the lack of time before the elections and parliamentary arithmetic which still favours the president, the move has little prospect for success.

But the scandal has hit Mr Poroshenko just at a moment when he appeared to be gaining electoral momentum  if polls are to be believed, pipping Ms Tymoshenko to second spot behind comedian Volodymyr Zelensky. The fall-out may yet decide who wins on 31 March.

For a country at war, the revelations made in the investigation are shocking enough.

The authors of the report, a group of independent Ukrainian journalists, link a close Poroshenko associate with fraudulent arms contracts that eventually cost the military £7 million.

The scheme involved the selling of spare parts for tanks at three times market value. Not only this, the parts were smuggled in from Russia, a hostile power.

While the contracts were signed by a 27-year-old called Ihor Hladovsky, the investigation concludes that they were in fact facilitated by his father, Oleh Hladovskiy, the deputy chair of Ukraine's security council and a key presidential ally.

Profits were siphoned away through three companies, including one that earlier belonged to the president. This, the journalists suggested, was evidence the corruption likely went higher.

Speaking with The Independent, journalist Denys Bihous, who led the investigation, said President Poroshenko was implicated by design.

If he really didnt want to know about it, then hed find a way of not knowing about it, he said. But Hladkovskiy is an old, old friend. He got his government job because of this friendship.

Sergii Leshchenko, a member of parliament and a Poroshenko critic, described Mr Hladkovskiy as one of the presidents closest associates in politics  pointing to how the two had bought holiday homes close to each other in Marbella.

This isnt the first time president had been implicated in corruption, he said, but what gives the revelations more weight is that they come a month before elections, concern corruption in the military sphere, and involve Russia.

According to Mr Leshchenko, still notionally a member of Mr Poroshenkos fraction in parliament, Ms Tymoshenkos proposal was a fair price for what the president had done. Mr Poroshenko deserved not only impeachment but jail, he said.

In a sign of the seriousness of the scandal engulfing Ukraines president, on Tuesday Oleh Hladkovskiy was temporarily suspended from his position on the Ukrainian Security Council.

Writing on Facebook, spokesman Svyatoslav Tsegolko said that Mr Poroshenko supported the suspension. He also asked law enforcement to undergo an urgent review of the information contained in the investigation.

Those concessions are unlikely to make Mr Poroshenko's problem disappear.

On Tuesday, another presidential rival, the Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi, piled on the pressure by concurring Mr Poroshenko had committed an offence impeachable in any other country.  But his solution was not the PR favoured by Ms Tymoshenko.

Instead, Ukrainians should to declare their own impeachment on 31 March.

Mayor Sadovyi remains a rank outsider for the presidential post. Ms Tymoshenko, on the other hand, will hope her intuitive move will reverse what had up to now been a disappointing campaign. In the space of a month, the one-time poll frontrunner has seen her rating overtaken by her two main rivals  comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and now incumbent Petro Poroshenko too.

Bihous said he had few illusions about the electoral sensitivity of his work.

In the days leading up to publication, their office was conspicuously staked out by security officers, he said. They arrived in cars with replacement number-plates, ""disappearing only when we approached.""",1
323,"SALT LAKE CITY â After nine years of court wrangling, including a dismissal and a mistrial, a Utah real estate investor accused of bilking investors out of tens of millions of dollars appears headed to prison.

A jury found Claud R. ""Rick"" Koerber guilty of 15 counts of wire fraud, fraud in the offer and sale of securities and money laundering Thursday after a three-week trial in U.S. District Court. The eight-man, four-woman jury acquitted him on two tax evasion charges.

Federal prosecutors say it's one of biggest Ponzi schemes in state history. U.S. Attorney John Huber called it ""emblematic"" of the types of fraud in Utah.

""Mr. Koerber, using talents that he has, gathered up almost $100 million dollars of investors' money. He used a substantial portion of that to repay other investors under the guise of interest payments. It was all a fraud. It was all a swindle,"" Huber said.

Koerber, who has profusely proclaimed his innocence throughout the long running case, did not immediately emerge from the courthouse for comment. He has maintained that he defrauded no one but ran a profitable business and was singled out by bureaucrats angered by his radio show, ""The Free Capitalist.""

Judge Frederic Block scheduled a sentencing hearing for Jan. 21. Prosecutors will make a sentencing recommendation over the next few months. Koerber will remain free from custody in the interim.

""It's in your best interest to behave yourself,"" the judge told him.

""There won't be any problems, your honor,"" Koerber replied.

The indictment alleged Koerber used his businesses â Founders Capital, and related companies Franklin Squires Investments and Franklin Squires Cos. â as a $100 million Ponzi scheme from 2004 to 2008. Prosecutors say about half the money was ""redistributed"" to other investors.

While investors believed their money would be used in secure real estate investments, Koerber spent it instead on luxury sports cars, producing a low-budget horror movie and his own lavish living, according to federal prosecutors.

Huber said it would be difficult to get investors' money back because much of it is gone.

Federal prosecutors first filed charges against Koerber in 2009.

Judge Clark Waddoups dismissed the case before it reached a jury in 2014, citing a ""pattern of widespread and continuous misconduct"" and violations of the Speedy Trial Act.

Prosecutors went on to file charges against Koerber a second time, but after weeks of testimony and seven days of deliberations last year, the jury couldn't reach a unanimous decision. Judge David Nuffer declared a mistrial, leaving the door open for prosecutors to refile the case.

Huber said it was worth the resources spent over the past nine years to get a conviction.

""It's always worth it to seek justice and to find justice,"" he said, adding federal agents and prosecutors would not let go of the case.

Huber said every trial, jury and judge is different, so it's hard to pin down how the second trial ended with a conviction.

""We know from our review that the majority of the jurors in the past case saw it our way, but that's the beauty of this system, that someone who's accused of a crime has the community judging them and not a prosecutor,"" he said.",1
358,"Federal authorities on Wednesday designated six reputed members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha street gang, which was founded in Los Angeles, as leaders of a transnational criminal organization.

The designation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury generally bars U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with the six named leaders and allows their financial assets to be frozen by federal investigators, authorities said.

Known as MS-13, the gang was founded in the Pico-Union and Westlake neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran refugees who had fled a civil war raging in their country.

A 2005 investigation by The Times found that years of deportations of MS-13 leaders from California helped spread the gang across Central America and Mexico and back into more than 30 states in the U.S.

Last year, MS-13 became the first street gang designated by the Treasury Department as a transnational criminal organization. The six reputed leaders identified by federal authorities Wednesday are all Salvadoran nationals and include the suspected Central American leader of the gang.

âThese individuals are heavily involved in directing and participating in illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and murder,â Treasury Department officials said in a statement.

The department identified the six suspected leaders as Moris Bercian Manchon, 28; Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 36; Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa-Larios, 35; Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, 44; Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35; and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34. Solarzano is the reputed Central American leader of the gang, according to federal authorities.

Federal authorities said Wednesday that MS-13 has tens of thousands of members and is âone of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world today.â

418,"ATLANTA Two metro-Atlanta chiropractors, Allan Spagnardi and Stacy Spagnardi, have been sentenced to federal prison for using their chiropractic clinic to commit healthcare fraud and for defrauding the Internal Revenue Service.

These chiropractors used their patients personal information to obtain over a million dollars from a private insurance company, said U. S. Attorney Byung J. (BJay) Pak. Then they went further by engaging in a lengthy scheme to hide their income from the IRS. Healthcare professionals who defraud insurance companies do not just abuse the trust afforded to them by their patients, they also drive up healthcare prices for honest citizens throughout the country.

The community has a right to expect that when seeking healthcare services, their healthcare provider will not abuse their private information for personal gain,"" said Thomas J. Holloman, III, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigations. Professionals, including chiropractors, who abuse the publics trust, will be held accountable and face severe consequences including imprisonment and substantial fines. The American public deserves our vigilance in the investigation and prosecution of allegations of fraud by unscrupulous healthcare professionals who hide income and evade the payment of their fair share of taxes.

The Spagnardis chose to take advantage of patients and the entire health care industry by billing for services that were never provided and defrauding the IRS, said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. This sentence will serve as a reminder to others that the FBI will not tolerate healthcare providers who engage in schemes to steal from taxpayers and defraud the industry.

Here in Georgia, we are committed to protecting consumers and taxpayers from bad actors like the Spagnardis, whose actions erode trust in our healthcare system and lead to higher premiums across the state, said Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John F. King. Im thankful for the work of U.S. Attorney Pak and his team to bring these individuals to justice and send a clear message that these types of activities will not be tolerated in Georgia.

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: Dr. Allan Spagnardi and Dr. Stacy Spagnardi operated a chiropractic clinic located in Marietta, Georgia. Over a multi-year period, the Spagnardis used their patients personal information to bill a private insurance company for services that were never actually rendered. At times, the Spagnardis submitted claims for reimbursement for services occurring when they were not even in the country. For instance, the Spagnardis claimed that their clinic had 296 patient visits during a week that they were actually on a cruise vacation out of the country.

Despite earning well over $1 million in personal income in 2014 and 2015, the Spagnardis failed to file federal income tax returns or pay federal income taxes for those tax years and instead took steps to hide their true income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). After the Spagnardis were indicted, they continued to take steps to hide their income from the IRS, including by filing a false federal income tax return in early 2018.

Allan Spagnardi, 41, and Stacy Spagnardi, 52, both of Atlanta, Georgia, were each sentenced to four years, three months of incarceration, and three years of supervised release. Both defendants were also ordered to pay full restitution to the victim of the offense.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Georgia Office of Commissioner of Insurance investigated the case.

314,"SINGAPORE: After her husband was hauled to court for giving illegal loans to borrowers including a client of hers, a property agent bribed her client to give a false statement for her husband's trial.

When she was nabbed and given her own charges for witness tampering, the woman absconded in the midst of her trial and fled to Malaysia on the pretext of attending to work-related matters.

Sally Lai Guek Ling, 45, returned to Singapore about a year later and turned herself in. She was sentenced on Friday (Oct 30) to two years' jail and fined S$78,000. As she cannot pay the fine, she will serve another three months' jail in default.

Lai pleaded guilty to four charges of instigating a witness to make a false declaration for use in the trial against her husband, offering this witness a bribe, conspiring with her husband to carry on a business of unlicensed moneylending and absconding from her trial.

Another four charges were taken into consideration.

The court heard that Lai was hired as a property agent for Salinah Ahmad and Sazali Ramli to assist in the sale of their flat in 2012. The couple was facing financial difficulties and had spoken to Lai about their problems.

Lai later introduced Salinah to Lai's husband, Kenny Tay Ann Siang, 46. Lai said her husband could give Salinah a loan, to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of her flat, without indicating the interest rate.

The couple agreed to the proposal as they needed cash, and Salinah borrowed S$30,000 from Tay over a few months even though Tay and Lai were not authorised to carry on a moneylending business.

In August 2012, Lai sold Salinah's flat for about S$270,000, but claimed about S$108,000 from the sales proceeds as repayment of the loan, with an interest rate of about 260 per cent.

In 2014, a senior manager with the Council of Estate Agencies lodged a police report in relation to the sale of Salinah's flat on suspicion of illegal moneylending activities by Lai.

The police investigated Lai and her husband, and Tay was arrested and later charged for unlicensed moneylending offences including the loan extended to Salinah.

HER HUSBAND CLAIMED TRIAL

Tay said he would claim trial and trial dates were fixed, but his wife contacted Salinah in March 2015 to say she needed Salinah's help for the trial. This was despite knowing that Salinah would be called as a witness in Tay's trial.

Between June and July 2015, Lai promised Salinah S$3,000 if she agreed to provide false testimony in Tay's trial, to exculpate him from the offences, and Salinah agreed.

Lai prepared a false declaration and Salinah signed it. However, her criminal acts were uncovered and Lai was charged in April 2017 for bribing witnesses.

Lai claimed trial to her offences and the trial began in June 2018. On the 13th day of her trial, she asked to leave Singapore to attend to work-related matters in Malaysia.

The judge granted this request, but Lai absconded and did not return to court for her trial on Dec 19, 2018. A warrant of arrest was issued against her, and she surrendered herself to the court in January this year.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yonghui asked for 27 months' jail and a fine of S$78,000, in default three months' jail. He highlighted that while Lai pleaded guilty, this was after she absconded in the middle of her trial.

SHE HAS SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS: DEFENCE

Defence lawyer Thong Chee Kun from Rajah & Tann asked for no more than 18 months' jail, saying that Lai's mental condition was a central theme of her mitigation.

""She has suffered from depression for almost 20 years,"" said Mr Thong. ""She was affected by her depression and her concern for her family.

""Based on 20 years of major depression she suffered, a lot of her actions were affected by the way she thought about the whole matter, by her desire to protect her family.""

He highlighted that Lai ultimately ""made the difficult decision to surrender herself voluntarily"".

""Against the backdrop of her mental condition, one can imagine the anguish and the suffering she had to go through while on the run. It was not an easy period for her, especially since she was separated from her children at the time,"" said the lawyer.

He said that while there was another lawyer representing Lai, Mr Thong and his colleague had represented Lai during her trial and was ""doing this at extremely low cost to help her complete the matter"".

He urged the court to impose a lenient in-default sentence as Lai cannot afford any fine.

""She looks forward to being reunited with her children ... and she wishes to start her life anew as soon as possible. She's also instructed us to apologise to the court and the prosecution for all the problems she has caused,"" said Mr Thong.

District Judge John Ng said: ""Madam Lai, I think the moment you stopped running, the moment you came back, you already started ... towards the road to recovering your life.""

He said she should be able to put this behind her within the year, as her jail term will be backdated to the date of her remand in January.

""You should be able to put this behind you, and as you wish, to look after your children and focus on them. Then please make your life in order after that,"" said the judge.

The trial for Lai's husband is still pending.",1
301,"Assets worth over Rs 22 crore, including a cinema hall and a hotel in Mumbai, oflate gangster Iqbal Mirchi's family have been attached in connection with a money laundering case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Tuesday.

A provisional order for attaching the properties has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

""The attached assets includes a talkies (cinema hall) and a hotel in Mumbai, an under construction hotel, a farm house, two bungalows and 3.5 acre land in Panchgani,"" the central investigative agency said in a statement.

The total value of the attachment is Rs 22.42 crore and it includes deposits kept in seven bank accounts, it said.

The total attachment in this money laundering case against the late gangster and his family is about Rs 798 crore as the agency had issuedattachments orders, including for overseas properties worth Rs 203 crore, in the past.

Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was alleged to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim in drug trafficking and extortion crimes.

""He (Mirchi) was an international drugs dealer and smuggler who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe,"" the ED had said earlier.

The agency alleged Mirchi ""indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai"".

It has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family and others last year to probe money laundering charges linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai.

This PMLA case is based on multiple FIRs lodged by the Mumbai police.

The agency had filed a charge sheet in this case before a Mumbai court in December and the court had subsequently issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi's sons Asif Memon and Junaid Memon and wife Hajra Memon.

132,"The multi-millionaire owner of the Nina Ricci fashion company was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC bank.

Arlette Ricci, 74 and one of the richest women in Europe, was âparticularly determinedâ to stash money in Swiss accounts for more than two decades.

A judgement handed down by a Paris criminal court added: âThe seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to the public good.â

Ricci had denied hiding the equivalent of more than Â£15million, saying she had simply tried to avoid tax â which is legal â rather than evade it, which is not.

However, bugged phone conversations between the heiress and her daughter, Margot Vignat, suggested otherwise. According to the transcript, Ms Ricci boasted that she changed banks to escape prosecution and spent the hidden funds on buying a chalet in an upmarket Swiss ski resort.

âI was never troubled. So I bought a chalet in Klosters, and now itâs fine. There was 2009, 2010, 2011 â itâs been three years so I think Iâm free of any type of inspection,â Ricci was heard to say.

Her daughter was heard warning her about the tax authorities, saying: 'Watch out all the same. They're vicious.'

But Ricci reassured her, saying: 'Everyone got done but not me. They had to give themselves in and pay a fortune.'

The daughter replied: 'Oh, that could cause some damage'. Ricci, in turn, said: 'Yes, of course, because all that is very illegal.'

In what will set a legal precedent for other cases of tax fraud through HSBC, Ricci was also fined the equivalent of more than Â£700,000.

Judges also ordered that houses in Paris and on the holiday island of Corsica worth more than Â£3m be seized.

Ricci was accused of transferring the deeds of the properties to family trusts in an attempt to restructure her assets, so as to evade penalties.

She was given a total of three years in prison, with two years suspended. Her daughter, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Henri-Nicolas Fleurance, Ricciâs tax adviser, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and an Â£8000 fine for attempting to organise her insolvency.

Jean-Marc Fedida, one of the defence barristers, said 'justice was done under frenetic, brutal pressure', so as to use a high-profile defendant as a 'warning to all those' with offshore accounts.

But he conceded the sentence was 'much lighter' that what the prosecution had asked for.

Ricci, who had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, may ask if she can serve the prison term under less strict conditions, including wearing an electronic tag, her lawyers said.

Her lawyers always argued the fault lay with HSBC in Switzerland, with one insisting in defence documents: 'She was in no way informed about how HSBC decided to structure the organisation of the funds she entrusted it with.'

They added that they were considering an appeal against sentence. Ricci was the first of more than 50 high-profile French nationals being pursued in the courts for using Swiss accounts to hide their money.

The judgment came after HSBC Holdings was formally placed under criminal investigation for complicity in fiscal fraud and illegal selling via its Swiss arm for two years starting in 2006.

Nina Ricci â real name Maria Adelaide Nielli â was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970.

Her son Robert, Arlette Ricciâs father, developed the companyâs perfume sideline and raised the firmâs international profile. Arlette Ricci inherited his fortune on his death in 1988.",1
393,"The biggest number of claimants ever tried together in an insurance fraud case have been handed sentences ranging from community service to custody.

Eight men claimed personal injury compensation following a minor collision between a car and bus in Cardiff.

Seven of the group were on the bus in May 2014 when it was hit from behind by a car driven by 30-year-old Merrick Williams (pictured).

Investigators found the impact of the low-speed collision would have been too small to have caused any injuries, but one passenger was seen on CCTV apparently being thrown to the floor, while others held their neck, hip and back.

This guy tried to crash into a bus with 7 mates on board so they could claim compensation. Nice try. #cashforcash https://t.co/LmrdHTwsoJ

 City Police Fraud (@CityPoliceFraud) October 12, 2017

AIG, which insured Williams vehicle, contacted the City of London Polices Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department in August 2014 after receiving personal injury claims from each of the group. Medical reports were submitted from five individuals.

Officers investigating the case found two of the claimants were friends with Williams on social media. It was further discovered the car involved was hired through a car rental company insured by AIG, meaning it had liability for the crash and any subsequent claims.

Williams, of Barry Island, was sentenced yesterday to 12 months in prison for conspiracy to commit fraud and dangerous driving. He was disqualified from driving for two years and fined £200.

Kassim Mukbill, Nigel Thomas Iti, Hamada Shuyeb, Kieran Murphy, Fahmi Haddad, Aaron Ryan and Matthew Saunders, all aged between 24 and 33 and from the Cardiff area, each admitted fraud and were given a suspended prison sentence, 150 hours community service and a £200 fine.

Detective Constable Aman Taylor, who led the investigation, said: This is the largest number of claimants tried together for an Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department case and shows the extent that people will go to for greed and money.

By planning the bus crash, the men deliberately put the safety of innocent people, including children, at risk in a bid to make money and take advantage of the personal injury claims system.",1
471,"The Portugal and Juventus footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an 18.8m (£16.5m) fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.

Ronaldo, 33, had been accused of defrauding the authorities of 14.8m (£12.9m) in unpaid taxes between 2011 and 2014.

In 2017, Madrids regional state prosecutor alleged the player had used what it deemed to be a shell company in the Virgin Islands to create a screen in order to hide his total income from Spains tax office.

It said Ronaldo intentionally did not declare income of 28.4m (£25m) related to image rights, and declared 11.5m of earnings from 2011-14 when his real income was almost 43m.

The prosecutor also alleged that the forward falsely reported income as coming from real estate, which it said had greatly reduced his tax rate.

Ronaldo arrived in court in Madrid on Tuesday morning, wearing sunglasses and a black blazer and accompanied by his partner, Georgina Rodríguez. His request to be allowed to enter the Provincial court through an underground carpark was denied.

The brief hearing came six months after Ronaldo agreed a deal that would see him spared jail if he paid fines totalling almost 19m.

In Spain, a judge can suspend sentences for two years or less for first-time offenders.

Earlier, Ronaldos former teammate at Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso, walked in to face his own case of tax fraud, his hands deep in his suit pockets. Yes, all good, was his only response to journalists questions.

Alonso is accused of defrauding tax authorities of about 2m euros from 2010-12.

He could be sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 4m, in addition to the amount allegedly defrauded. The charges are related to Alonsos income from image rights. The retired Spain midfielder, who has denied any wrongdoing, played for Madrid from 2009-14.",1
311,"As former Defense Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos prepares to spend the Orthodox Easter weekend in a police cell, a 103-page prosecutors? report has provided shocking evidence of an extensive money-laundering network that appears to have financed a life of luxury.

According to the report by prosecutors Evgenia Kyvelou and Eleni Siskou, the 73-year-old minister has pocketed millions of euros in under-the-table payments for defense procurements since 1997, with the frequency of illicit transactions peaking between 1999 and 2002. These activities were concealed with the help of close associates who ran three offshore companies to hide the money, some of which was used to buy the ex-minister?s array of assets, the report said.

The report lists all the transactions, including the names of the financial institutions involved.

Millions of euros? worth of deposits in several European banks, including 16.2 million Swiss francs (or 13.5 million euros) in Switzerland, have been linked to the procurement of Tor M1 missiles.

The three implicated offshore firms -- Cyprus-based Torcaso, Liberia-based Nobilis and US-based Blue Bell -- all belonged to Tsochatzopoulos, according to the report, but were run by close associates including his first cousin, Nikolaos Zigras, also a former minister.

Zigras is to face an investigating magistrate on Tuesday, as is the entrepreneur Giorgos Sachpatzidis and Efrosini Lambropoulou, an accountant and representative of one of the three offshore firms. A fourth suspect, Asterios Economidis, head of one of the offshore companies, testified before a magistrate Thursday.

The money laundering was conducted chiefly through the purchase of properties in Athens, according to the report, which notes that the transactions traced are believed to be only a fraction of those carried out over a decade or so.

One example is the purchase of the ex-minister?s luxurious home on Dionysiou Areopagitou Street in central Athens. The neoclassical building was purchased in 2010 by Tsochatzopoulos?s wife, Vassiliki Stamati, for 1.38 million euros though it had previously belonged to Torcaso and Nobilis, two of the offshore companies listed in Tsochatzopoulos?s name.

In a related development Thursday, Tsochatzopoulos?s daughter, Areti, denied media reports that gold bars were found at her home. She said that police seized 10 pieces of gold leaf, which weigh 99 grams each and are worth a total of 29,000 euros, as well as nine 1935 gold sovereigns that she inherited from her grandfather.

Tsochatzopoulos?s wife and daughter could also face charges in connection to the probe into the veteran politician?s property dealings.",1
1069,"Jakarta's police announced the city was secure following a terrorist attack in a busy shopping area on Thursday morning that left several dead.

""At the moment the situation is under control,"" a spokesperson said, according to AFP news agency. Police reported there were no more attackers at large.

Seven people, including two policement and four of the attackers, were killed in a series of coordinated assaults around the city, which began with an explosion at a Starbucks in a heavily populated shopping area and continued with an attack on a nearby police post.

Officials have since announced that the attacks were carried out by a group with links to the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) terror group. Aamaaq news agency, which is affiliated with IS, also said the organization was behind Thursday's events.

War in the streets

As frightened civilians looked on, police engaged in gun battles with the attackers while bloodied bodies lay strewn about in the street.

It was still unclear who was behind the attack, although Indonesian authorities said IS had threatened a large-scale attack not long before Thursday's events.

The government deployed some 150,000 security personnel around the city following the attack.

Terrorism persists

Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, has been the victim of a string of terrorist attacks over the past decade and a half.

The country suffered several bombings between 2000 and 2009. In 2002, it was the victim of an attack on the popular resort island of Bali, which left 202 dead.

An estimated 500-700 Indonesians have gone to the Middle East to join IS. According to one monitoring group, many of them have since returned.",0
388,"Sirleaf was a deputy governor of the institution during the period when the bank notes were illegally ordered. He was arrested along with two central bank colleagues on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The director of banking, Dorbor Hagba, was also arrested on Thursday, while Milton Weeks - central bank governor until he stepped down when President George Weah took office in January 2018 - surrendered to police the next day.

Two other men, named as accomplices, have been evading arrest, according to police. The death of a former senior central bank official on Saturday attracted further public interest in the case. Matthew J. Innis, the institution's one-time deputy director for micro-finance in the regulation and supervision division, was reportedly killed in a hit-and-run road incident.

The American aid agency USAID and the Liberian government funded the investigations which were launched last year in October following the suspected disappearance of newly printed notes worth $100 million (88 million) destined for the Liberian central bank - the equivalent of around 5 percent of the West African nation's gross domestic product.

A London-based firm, Kroll, was hired to carry out the audit. The supposed disappearance led to a travel departure ban on 15 people, including Charles Sirleaf.

""Kroll has identified discrepancies at every stage of the process for controlling the movement of banknotes into and out of the (central bank),"" the risk consultancy said in its report that had been commissioned by the United States at the request of the Liberian government.

$16.5 million missing

A Liberian government report found that notes worth $16.5 million remained unaccounted for and said the bank's management ""deviated from conventional best practices.""

In 2016, Liberia's House of Representatives passed a resolution approving the printing of 5 billion Liberian dollars (US$31 million; 27 million).

The Central Bank requested an additional 10 billion Liberian dollars but the request was denied by the Senate. The bank engaged a company to print the additional banknotes anyway.

""This raised the risk of unintended negative economic effect, including high inflation and the rapid depreciation"" of the Liberian dollar, the report said.

Kroll said its investigation found no evidence of a large shipment of cash going missing as had been reported by local media. Instead, the new bank notes all arrived from a Swedish company but the central bank then failed to properly track what was done with them, the report said.

The report said most of the bank notes are believed to have been put into circulation without authorities removing and destroying the old bills they were designed to replace.

Anderson Miamen, executive director of CENTAL in Liberia, believes that the money went into the pockets of individuals: ""It means the money was misapplied, and misapplication means converting property that is not yours into your personal benefit.""

""If the money isn't available and there is no record of the money being infused into the economy, it means it has to be somewhere.

""And that somewhere would be in private accounts of individuals connected to the process.""

Liberians anxious and disappointed

The report said officials at the central bank were unable to explain who approved the injection of new bank notes without removing the old ones or how the money was infused into the Liberian economy.

Mark Dahen, a Liberian journalist. finds the situation ""utterly embarrassing.""

""Many Liberians were anxious about this report and have been disappointed since this news broke about the missing 16 billion Liberian dollars.""

Several organizations have been pressuring the government to ensure that concrete actions come from this investigation, he told DW.

Critics of President George Weah's government have accused his administration of having had a hand in the poor handling of the bank notes for their personal gain, an allegation they have denied.

Miamen underlined that the malpractice is, first of all, a failure of the government.

""But it is also the failure of the oversight body or the internal control system of the bank.""

He believes that the problem lies with how Liberia is dealing with impunity: ""I can point to the lack of action on or against individuals who [...] abuse their power.""

""What needs to happen is to address impunity on a broader level in this country.""

""The second thing is if institutions or the different agencies were effectively playing their role, if internal controls system were actually exercising their responsibility and doing due diligence, we would have probably not gotten to this point,"" he said.

Not the first Sirleaf scandal

Dahen told DW he believes that this is just more proof that having family members of important politicians in high positions at economic institutions is difficult.

""This is not the first time that members of the Sirleaf family have been the source of scandal. Some years back, Robert Sirleaf was also implicated in some corrupt practices.""

Robert Sirleaf, another son of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was the chairman of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), that went bankrupt under his chairmanship in 2016.

Under his management, 30 million to 40 million US dollars disappeared.

""Generally we can see that there were incidences of corruption or scandals that were reported under the Sirleaf administration."" Miamen said

""Some of the children or family members of the president had very high positions or lucrative positions in government. So this is not a strange news really, in the sense of family members of the president being at the center of kind of controversy.

""Given the incidences of corruption and the dubious nature of some of the dealings under the then leadership of Sirleaf, we can see that it is not strange that something like this is coming up.""

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf herself was listed in the Paradise Papers 2012 as a director of a Bermuda-based financial company. The leak shows how many of Africa's rich and powerful  from the head of Nigeria's Senate, Bukola Saraki, to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia  park their money in offshore havens.",0
391,"Banking giant Wachovia Corp. will pay $160 million to settle a federal investigation into laundering of illegal drug profits through Mexican exchange houses in the largest case of its kind ever brought against a U.S. bank, prosecutors said Wednesday.

""This is historic,"" acting U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sloman said. ""There is no other case like this one anywhere.""

The probe, which began in 2005 when a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics dog in Florida detected cocaine traces in an airplane, ultimately uncovered at least $110 million in drug profits laundered from Mexico through Wachovia. The total settlement includes forfeiture in that amount plus a $50 million fine.

""DEA will follow drug money wherever it leads us,"" said Mark R. Trouville, chief of the DEA's Miami office.

The agreement means Wachovia and its executives will avoid criminal prosecution in return for the $160 million payment and significant improvements in its anti-money laundering program. If those and other conditions are met within one year, potential criminal charges for failure to maintain a system to detect money launderers will be dropped.

Wachovia, now a unit of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., said in a statement that Wells Fargo had already set aside money to pay the settlement. The statement said Wachovia, based in Charlotte, ended its relationships with foreign currency exchange houses in 2008.

""Wachovia Bank has fully cooperated with the federal government throughout the course of its investigation,"" the statement said.

The $160 million fine and forfeiture represents the biggest penalty ever imposed under the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to keep close tabs on suspicious transactions that could indicate money is being laundered from criminal enterprises. According to prosecutors, Wachovia's program was woefully inadequate and bank executives knew it, meaning that numerous red flags were missed over a three-year period.

In fact, officials said Wachovia had no way of checking some $420 billion in transactions from Mexican exchange houses for possible money-laundering activity. That means investigators didn't get potentially key information on drug cartels, terrorist financing networks and other organized crime enterprises.

""The integrity of our financial system is at stake,"" said Charles Steele, deputy director of the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ""It poses a very serious problem, a very serious threat for law enforcement.""

Beginning with that DEA drug-sniffing dog in June 2005, investigators began tracing the source of money for airplanes being used to ferry cocaine in Colombia and Mexico that was ultimately destined for the U.S. Those initial money transfers were overseen by a Wachovia office in Miami.

Ultimately at least $13 million from the Mexican exchanges went through Wachovia for the purchase of aircraft, according to court documents. Four of them were seized by investigators, along with more than 22 tons of cocaine.

From there, investigators from the DEA, Internal Revenue Service and other agencies tracked billions of dollars in wire transfers, bulk cash shipments and other transactions from the Mexican exchanges through Wachovia. Many were considered suspicious, including such tactics as multiple round-number wire transfers on the same day for a single account; deposits of traveler's checks with sequential numbers that contain unusual markings; and bulk cash transfers up to 50 percent larger than a customer had led Wachovia to expect.

Under the agreement, Wells Fargo cannot use taxpayer money provided under the federal financial bailout program  known as TARP  to pay its fine and forfeiture amounts. A Wachovia spokewoman said Wells Fargo fully repaid its TARP money to the government in late 2009, before the money-laundering settlement was finalized.",1
1034,"Growing worries about the use of the U.S. financial system to launder funds for terrorists has spurred proposals for new state and federal regulations aimed at tightening money-laundering controls.

""If you look at what's been happening in terrorism around the world, ISIS is an example of a terrorist organization that is now becoming sufficiently institutionalized in terms of its access to natural resources and substantial amounts of money,"" says cybercrime attorney Lauren Resnick, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where she led the computer crimes and intellectual property section. She now works at the law firm BakerHostetler.

""So, the view is that terrorist financing is hitting a new stage. And while individual acts of terrorism are not necessarily costly, we have major organizations around the world that may want to access the U.S. financial system because they have significant amounts of capital to invest. That is a big concern among the players in the financial industry, as well as the regulators.""

State and Federal Regulatory Changes

In an exclusive interview with Information Security Media Group, Resnick explains how proposed state and federal regulatory changes for Bank Secrecy Act compliance are spurring banks and other financial services firms to use intelligence and anomaly detection to more proactively detect suspicious activity.

""Many of the major banks have actually developed intelligence divisions alongside their anti-money-laundering compliance groups, that are composed of former military and law enforcement intelligence officers, to conduct data analytics, to make sure that they're looking at trends in the transaction activity that is proactive, and not simply reactive, to identify any potential nexus or contact with known terrorist organizations,"" she says. ""So it's taking on a new level of both financial commitment and resource commitment at many global banks.""

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in August proposed rules that would require investment advisers, including certain hedge funds and private fund managers, to establish anti-money-laundering programs and report suspicious activity - basically requiring that investment advisers comply with the same Bank Secrecy Act requirements as banks and other financial entities. And in December, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced proposals for new AML and terrorist financing regulations that would require senior financial executives to certify the effectiveness of AML systems.

New York's proposed regulatory oversight aims to address perceived shortcomings in Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs, Resnick says.

During this interview (see audio link below photo), Resnick also discusses:

Why regulators want to see banks investing in ""meaningful"" transactions monitoring that uses a rules-based approach;
How AML departments and staff are viewed as being more critical to business operations than they were three years ago; and
Why steep BSA fines have helped AML departments acquire bigger budgets to fund transaction monitoring systems.

Resnick is a member of the white collar and corporate investigations team at the law firm BakerHostetler. She is regularly retained by executive management and audit committees of Fortune 500 corporations to conduct internal investigations on FCPA; AML; trade sanctions and OFAC; securities fraud; accounting; and employment matters, and to provide advice about cybercrime issues.

558,"(CNN) The idea of a private border wall started with a GoFundMe campaign that rapidly raked in more than $20 million. Now prosecutors accuse former top Trump aide Steve Bannon and others tied to the project of defrauding donors and pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses.

It's the latest development in a project that's spurred controversy since its inception, while drawing millions of dollars of support and endorsements from many Trump allies.

Here's a look at some of the key events that have unfolded since the project began in 2018:

The campaign begins

Brian Kolfage, a triple amputee and Air Force veteran, starts a GoFundMe campaign in December 2018 saying ""political inaction"" has inspired him to raise private funds for a border wall. Within days, the project raises more than $20 million dollars.

Construction starts

The nonprofit created in connection with the campaign, ""We Build the Wall,"" announces in May 2019 it has broken ground on its first private border wall project in Sunland Park, New Mexico. ""Buckle up, we're just getting started,"" the group says in a Facebook post. Organizers say the private wall is about a mile long.

Ordered to 'cease and desist'

Days later, city officials order construction to ""cease and desist,"" stating that proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage calls the order ""political intimidation.""

Dispute with a federal agency

The next month a federal agency forces open a gate in the new, privately constructed border wall, arguing proper permits weren't obtained. Kolfage slams the commission, accusing the agency of overreaching its authority.

A wall on the Rio Grande

Contractor Fisher Industries begins work on a three-mile stretch of private border wall in November 2019. It's located on a sugar cane farm in Mission, Texas, along the Rio Grande. Kolfage tells CNN that We Build the Wall provided $1.5 million for that project, describing that as 9% of the total cost.

The project is temporarily halted after being sued by federal prosecutors and the National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre wild butterfly habitat near the project's location, but later is allowed to resume. Fisher's method of building just feet from the Rio Grande becomes a point of contention, in part because of the potential for flooding and damage to surrounding property.

A new proposal

Interviews and correspondence obtained exclusively by CNN in February 2020 show that We Build the Wall had been communicating with the Trump administration about plans to build a wall along the southern border and donate it to the US government.

Reports of erosion

As a part of its lawsuit over the private project, the butterfly center says it documented erosion at the base of the Texas wall in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna in July 2020. Photos viewed by CNN show cracks in the ground between the wall and the river.

""We've got another storm headed this way. If a 'Category 1' already caused so much damage, I hate to see what this next storm is going to do,"" says Javier Peña, a lawyer for the center.

In response to allegations of erosion, Kolfage in August 2020 .

New York federal prosecutors charge Kolfage, Bannon and two others in August 2020 with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of the border wall fundraising campaign. Bannon, Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

615,"PORTLAND, Ore.Portland resident Isaiah Holt, 31, pleaded guilty today to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, money laundering, and illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Holt is a licensed electrician, motivational speaker, and fitness coach.

According to court documents, beginning in July 2016 and continuing until his arrest in April 2018, Holt used his association with a licensed marijuana producer in Portland to divert state-legal marijuana into the black market. Holt sold marijuana in-person to out-of-state customers traveling to Oregon and by mail to remote customers using the U.S. Postal Service.

Holt recruited two individuals to use their bank accounts to receive and launder proceeds of his marijuana sales. Out-of-state customers would send Holt mailing addresses and deposit payments into bank accounts in the names of various third-party associates. Holt would then direct these associates to withdraw the money from their accounts on his behalf. He used the cash to purchase multiple vehicles that he registered in his girlfriend and co-defendants name, Marjorie Livington. Holt also directed Livingston, 39, of Portland, to purchase and register firearms for him using her name.

On April 4, 2018, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) obtained and executed a search warrant on Holt and Livingstons Northeast Portland residence. Agents found 11.5 grams of cocaine and nearly $2,000 in cash on Holts person and drug packaging materials, shipping labels, 14 pounds of marijuana, three firearms, and $46,100 in cash in the residence.

After his arrest and federal indictment, Holt continued to distribute cocaine. From April to August 2019, law enforcement conducted three controlled purchases of cocaine from Holt. While on his way to a fourth pre-arranged buy, Holt eluded a marked police car and later fled on foot, discarding approximately two ounces of cocaine along the way. In total, law enforcement purchased or recovered from Holt approximately 158 grams of cocaine during these purchases.

Conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $1 million fine, and three years supervised release. Money laundering is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $500,000 fine or twice the value of property involved, and three years supervised release. Illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years supervised release.

Holt will be sentenced on March 9, 2020 by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Michael W. Mosman.

As part of his plea agreement, Holt has agreed to forfeit one Smith & Wesson .40 caliber pistol, one Ruger AR-556 5.56 caliber rifle, one Taurus 9mm pistol, all seized ammunition, and $46,100 in cash. He has also agreed to pay $32,600 to satisfy a forfeiture money judgement.

Livingston was indicted alongside Holt for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and making false statements during the purchase of a firearm. She is scheduled to plead guilty to the firearms charge on December 16, 2019.

The case was investigated by ATF, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Portland Police Bureau. It is being prosecuted by Julia Jarrett and Leah Bolstad, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.

The case was brought as part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). PSN is the centerpiece of the Department of Justices violent crime reduction efforts. PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime. Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.

469,"SINGAPORE: A former deputy group director with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) was charged on Friday (Jul 24) with taking about S$1.24 million in bribes in the form of loans to advance contractors or subcontractors business interests with LTA.

Henry Foo Yung Thye, 46, was charged with 36 offences, including obtaining or attempting to obtain bribes in the form of loans from contractors or subcontractors and cheating his colleagues.

Twenty-two of the charges were for taking bribes in the form of loans from the contractors or subcontractors between 2014 and 2019, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said in a press release on Friday.

He is also accused of cheating his LTA colleagues into giving him about S$726,500 in loans between 2008 and 2019.

He had dishonestly concealed from them that the loans were intended to service his gambling habit and debts, charge sheets state.

This makes the total sum of the money involved across all of Foo's charges almost S$2 million, Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting told the court.

Charge sheets said that Foo took sums of between S$1,000 and S$200,000 from various directors of firms to advance their business interests with LTA.

The biggest single sum of S$200,000 was allegedly sought from Tiong Seng Contractors director Pay Teow Heng in June 2017, so that Foo would advance the contractor's business interests with LTA.

The prosecutor had asked for bail of S$500,000 for Foo, who was unrepresented. Foo told the court that he intends to plead guilty to his corruption charges and asked for the bail to be ""a manageable amount"", adding that he wants to have some time with his children.

The prosecutor told the court that none of the money lost in the corruption charges has been recovered so far.

Foo was offered bail of S$250,000 and will return to court for a pre-trial conference next month.

DIRECTORS, MANAGERS AND COMPANY CHARGED

Six individuals and a company were also charged in relation to Foos alleged offences.

Pay, the director of Tiong Seng Contractors, was among the six charged on Friday. The company's managing director, Pek Lian Guan, was also charged.

Pay, 52 and Pek, 55, allegedly conspired to give bribes in the form of loans of about S$350,000 to Foo, to advance the business interests of the company with the LTA.

They each face two charges of corruption.

Two South Koreans who worked for Daewoo Engineering and Construction were also charged with giving bribes to Foo.

Project manager Ro Sung-young, 48, and project director Kim Young-gyu, 51, were accused of conspiring to give about S$50,000 in bribes to Foo in the form of loans. They each face two charges of corruption.

Chinese national Cai Jungang, who was a director of Tritech Engineering and Testing (Singapore), was also charged with giving about S$285,000 in loans to Foo to bribe him to advance the companys business interest with LTA. The 56-year-old is facing seven charges of corruption.

Zhang Xihu, who was a director of MEPT Engineering at the time of the alleged offences, is accused of giving about S$325,000 in bribes to Foo in the form of loans. The 52-year-old faces seven charges of corruption.

The China Railway Tunnel Group (Singapore Branch) is accused of corruptly giving bribes, in the form of loans totalling about S$220,000, to Foo. The company faces three charges of corruption.

One of the charges is for giving a bribe in the form of a S$100,000 loan to Foo, then a deputy group director of the Thomson-East Coast and Cross Island Lines under LTA, in order to advance China Railway Tunnel Group's interests with LTA.

A representative for the company, Mr Fan Peng, asked for an adjournment to seek legal advice.

In relation to the offences involving the payments from the China Railway Tunnel Group, a 53-year-old man was charged with forgery.

Chen Xuguang, who worked as a director at Tong Sheng Construction and Trading, is accused of abetting the falsification of Tong Sheng invoices and faces two charges of forgery. Tong Sheng is a subcontractor of the China Railway Tunnel Group.

Most of the accused were represented by lawyers from firms including WongPartnership and Rajah & Tann.

Anyone convicted of corruption can be fined up to S$100,000, jailed for up to five years or both.

The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption can be increased to seven years if it is in relation to a matter or contract with the Government or a public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised in such a contract.

Anyone convicted of cheating or falsification of accounts can be fined and imprisoned for up to 10 years.

Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and fraud. Bribery, cheating and the falsification of accounts are serious offences, CPIB said.

In response to CNA's queries, an LTA spokesperson confirmed Foo was charged in court on Friday for corruption and fraud.

""As the case is now before court, we are unable to comment on the matter,"" the spokesperson said.",1
845,"What REALLY happens when an insider buys stock?

I'm talking about insider ""trading"". This is the legal kind, when insiders buy and sell company shares.

There are a lot of different reasons that may influence why an insider is buying and if you should be following their lead.

But how do you figure out what is a good insider ""buy"" and if you should be jumping in?

The key is in the secret signals.

Insiders Will Send Signals

Investors who want to get in on insider trading can simply buy what the insiders are buying.

There are plenty of lists for ""insider buys"" put out every week. But those lists don't really tell you the full story. It's simply a bunch of names and numbers of shares.

What's the REAL story behind the buy?

As the editor of the Insider Trader portfolio, I've looked at hundreds of insider buys. Patterns emerge. Insiders often give out secret signals, but you have to know what to look for.

Here are 3 of the secret signals that I use to find the diamonds in the rough of the insider trades. Find these secret signals and insider buying will no longer seem like a mystery.

3 Secret Signals to Successful Insider Trading

1) ""The Lawyer Indicator""

The General Counsel (or ""Senior Counsel"" at some companies) is the company's top lawyer and is considered part of management. Being a lawyer myself, I can tell you that lawyers are, in general, risk averse. (Sorry lawyers!)

Therefore, when it comes to buying company stock, they usually err on the side of caution. They rarely buy shares on the open market unless they're seeing something that is really great at their company.

If you see the General Counsel buying, that is a strong secret signal. I call it ""the lawyer indicator."" Buy when the lawyers are buying.

According to legendary investor Peter Lynch, when major officers buy shares of their own companies, there's only one reason: They expect the stock price to go up.

Using a proprietary strategy, Zacks Investment Research is distilling a handful of the most compelling insider stock purchases. These timely recommendations are now open to public view - but only until Sunday, November 12.

See the stocks now >>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Buy When There Are Cluster Trades

The insider buys that get the most publicity are the famous CEOs who buy, for example, $1 million worth of shares (or more) in one massive buy.

While these big buys are great, and can mean something exciting is going on at the company, I look for the complete opposite. I look for the ""cluster"" trades, where a group of insiders are all buying at the same time.

That means, for example, there may be 3 Directors, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Marketing all buying smaller amounts of shares, but all deciding to do so around the same time. This type of cluster buying is rarer than the one big buy by the CEO and sends a powerful signal.

What do they ALL know?

3) Buy If Insiders Are Jumping in For the First Time

There are some insiders who buy company shares on the open market several times a year. Some of the senior insiders, like the CEO and CFO, are usually paid at a higher level than the other senior management and buying company shares isn't much of a hardship.

But for other senior management lower down the chain, like the General Counsel or the head of Human Resources, among others, there may be a different calculation when deciding to buy that $10,000 worth of stock.

It's not unusual to see insiders who have NOT bought shares in many years, if ever, deciding to buy some shares.

The insider who has NEVER bought shares before, but is now, sends a strong signal.

I'm not talking about someone who is new at the company. This would be an insider who has worked at the company for several years and only now has decided to jump in.

What does that insider know that is different from the prior years? Why are they buying now?

And how can you take full advantage of this buying activity?

Where to Find the Best Insider Buys

Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information for a company, but it's time consuming to literally search through hundreds of individual companies.

Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you in a weekly list. Have you ever seen one of those lists? The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.

To solve this problem, our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations. We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys to find the very best.

Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks' Insider Trader.

Right now, we've narrowed it down to 10 insider buys that make the grade.

Our strategy indicates that it's time to follow this CEO and load up on shares.

1018,"U.S. anti-money laundering regulations are well-developed, and domestic coordination to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing is sophisticated and has improved over the past 10 years, according to a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) evaluation issued Thursday.

The FATF is an independent intergovernmental body that promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing.

In the first evaluation of the U.S. regulatory system undertaken by the FATF since 2006, the report states that the U.S. regulatory framework has made significant progress since the previous assessment and states that the United States effectively investigates and prosecutes money laundering and terrorist financing.

The FATFs report also states that under the Bank Secrecy Act, U.S. financial institutions have an evolved understanding of money laundering risks. Financial sectors bear most of the burden in combating money laundering in the United States, and the evaluation found that financial institutions have systems and processes for implementing preventive measures, including onboarding of customers, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious transactions.

The evaluation did note some gaps in U.S. anti-money laundering regulations. FATF guidelines call for member governments to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities and oversight over practicing accountants in firms as well as lawyers, casino operators, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones, and other independent legal professionals.

The United States has not adopted the FATF recommendation to establish anti-money laundering responsibilities over these professions. In the case of the accounting profession, the money-laundering provisions in the Bank Secrecy Act do not separately regulate accountants. But accountants working for financial institutions covered by the Bank Secrecy Act are subject to the anti-money laundering requirements imposed on those entities.

Nonetheless, the FATF cited gaps in U.S. regulations, including:

Minimal coverage of certain institutions and businesses.
Minimal measures imposed on certain nonfinancial businesses and professions. The FATF found that casinos are the only one of a number of key sectors in the United States outside of financial services/banking that are required to report suspicious transactions. Professionals who are not subject to sufficient anti-money laundering regulations include accountants, investment advisers, lawyers, real estate agents, and certain trust company and service providers, according to the FATF.
Lack of access to adequate, accurate, and current beneficial ownership information. This inability to determine the true owner of a company, such as a shell company, creates opportunities for money launderers to hide illicit proceeds, according to the FATF.
Lack of a uniform approach to state-level anti-money laundering efforts. The FATF reported that it is not clear that all states devote enough priority to preventing and detecting money laundering.",0
279,"FORMER Minister of Health and Child Care David Parirenyatwa has been arrested on alleged criminal abuse of office charges.

Reports say the former top government official was arrested this Thursday morning and he is being questioned by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID)âs Serious Fraud Squad.

There was no immediate detail on what his offence was about although he was in 2015 accused of unprocedurally receiving some payment to the tune of US$100 000 through his private surgery by the Premier Service Medical Aid Society.

The then Minister allegedly pocketed money services for services he had not rendered through the struggling health insurer.

The Parirenyatwa insisted the transaction was above board as PSMAS had not paid him for services rendered to its affiliates for a long time.",1
813,"UNDP, UNODC, and the Kingdom of Morocco supported the Arab Anti-Corruption and Integrity Network (ACINET) in organising a special event that focused on the Arab region on the sidelines of the 6th Session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), held in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 2-6 November 2015.

The special event, âThe UNCAC and the ACAC: Synergies and Implications for Anti-Corruption Legislations in the Arab Regionâ, was held on 4 November. Over 60 representatives from delegations including ministers, representatives from national authorities and civil society organizations attended the event, which included as panelists Ashaf Rifi, Chair of ACINET and Minister of Justice of Lebanon, Mohamed Moubdi, Minister in charge of Public Service and Modernization of the Administration in Morocco, Jason Reichelt, representing UNODC, and Arkan El Seblani representing UNDP.

This event presented a comparative analysis of the UNCAC and the Arab Convention against Corruption (ACAC), along with an update on the status of related laws in Arab countries and the linkages between the two Conventions and the 2030 Development Agenda, namely Goal 16.

Discussions focused on related challenges and needs for Arab countries, and reiterated the commitment to deepen regional collaboration on common priorities in the framework of ACINET. Participants also stressed the need to deepen UNCAC implementation efforts, namely in relation to corruption prevention and international cooperation, while also supporting the implementation of the ACAC based on a process or mechanism to monitor its implementation.",0

123,"It is clear that Danske Bank has failed to live up to its responsibility in the case of possible money laundering in Estonia.

So said Thomas Borgen, CEO of Denmarkâs biggest financial institution, when he resigned after admitting that around â¬200 billion of questionable money flowed through the Danish bankâs Estonian branch from 2007-15.

To put that figure into some perspective, the GDP of Estonia in 2017 was â¬29 billion and the figure in question is approaching two thirds of the GDP of Denmark itself at â¬324 billion.

It raises serious questions over the capacity of banks â and governments â to combat the serious scourge of money laundering. The European Commission has called the case the âbiggest scandal in Europeâ and Danske Bank and Denmark and Estoniaâs financial watchdogs face an inquiry from the European Unionâs banking supervisor to see whether they broke the law.

Money laundering facilitates crime, undermines financial systems and ultimately can seriously damage economies. This is all well recognised â and yet it seems that even the worldâs most sophisticated financial regimes cannot control the flow of suspect money through the system.

To get some perspective on the scale of the problem, the National Crime Agency estimates that the cost of money laundering to the UK economy is Â£24 billion a year. Globally, it is estimated that up to 5 per cent of global GDP â thatâs Â£1.5 trillion â is laundered by criminals each year.

Money laundering is the process by which âdirty moneyâ â which is to say money that is identifiable as the proceeds of crime â is made to look legitimate by passing it through financial systems to disguise its suspicious origins.

Various techniques are used, generally involving layers of transactions. This may involve moving money through different countries and then returning it in a way that looks legitimate. It may involve spurious transactions at inflated values such as paying a high price for a shell company, the purchase and resale of property or legitimate businesses.

Even fake litigation has been used to disguise the ultimate source of funds â a cash intensive business is set up, documents are created to suggest a legitimate debt and then a solicitor is approached to recover it. When the fake debtor makes a payment, the funds are passed through the solicitorâs bank account and back to the client.

The Danske case

In recognition of the extent of the problem, the G7 group of major economies formed the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering back in 1989. The idea behind this was to produce a set of standards and guidelines and to monitor progress on anti-money laundering regimes.

The focus is to identify suspicious transactions and report them. For anti-money laundering efforts to be successful, it requires financial institutions to know their customers. This means that banks must be able to identify the ultimate beneficial recipient of a transaction â so the person who takes the profit â of any customer on their books.

This is where Danske Bank ran into trouble. Its Estonian branch came about when Danske acquired Sampo Bank, a small Finnish Bank in 2007. Sampo had a non-resident portfolio in Estonia and it is this that caused the problems.

In the words of the independent report into the scandal, which preempted CEO Borgenâs resignation: âAnti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch had been manifestly insufficient and inadequate.â Danske Bank has also admitted there were âmajor deficiencies in controls and governance that made it possible to use Danske Bankâs branch in Estonia for criminal activities such as money launderingâ.

Danske shut down the non-resident portfolio in 2015 after it became clear that the bankâs anti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch werenât working. As a mere branch, Estonia should have been subject to Danskeâs own money laundering systems â but the branch had its own IT platform, which meant it was not covered by the same risk monitoring as the bankâs Copenhagen headquarters.

The independent investigation found that more than half of Danskeâs 15,000 customers in Estonia were suspicious. The source of funds passing through the portfolio was identified as more than 58 per cent coming from Russia, Estonia and Latvia. The destinations of the funds were worldwide.

The difficulty in identifying the true source of the funds comes from the lack of transparency as to the real owners of the customers in the portfolio. A proportion of them are UK-based companies that are registered as limited liability partnerships â this means they are not required to publish details of their eventual owners. This is a classic case of money laundering where ownership often passes through a series of shell companies before the eventual owner can be identified.

The customers are being investigated by several national authorities including the FBI and the UK National Crime Agency. The Danish regulator is investigating Danske Bank itself. Harsh penalties for the bank could ensue â Denmarkâs business minister said the Danish authorities could fine Danske 4 billion Danish kroner (Â£475 million). But it remains to be seen what the long-term damage will be for Danske, if any.

A wider question surrounds the failure of international anti-money laundering regimes. To date there have been no examples of significant criminal sanctions for failure to implement an effective anti-money laundering process within a business. Nor is there any rigorous external scrutiny of how guidelines are implemented. But it is high time there was â while there is still a financial system to protect.",1
305,"Zimbabweans have woken up to news that Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri has died and while President Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the passing in a moving tribute to his colleague, it was the unsavoury reactions to Shiriâs death which stood out.

Prior to joining government in 2017, Shiri had served in the Zimbabwe Air Force for 25 years and is also the cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, whom he helped remove out of office after 30 years at the helm.

âGood Riddanceâ, said one social media user.

He died in the early hours of Wednesday, 29 July 2020, however many have been less than pleasant in their responses to his passing â citing his role in the army massacres, known as âGukurahundiâ.

Perrance Shiri and the dark history of Gukurahundi

As many as 30 000 people were killed between 1983 and 1987, by a brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) â as part of a crackdown on dissidents in Matabeleland North Province, a homeland of the Ndebele.

Thousands of Ndebele were detained by government forces and either marched to re-education camps or brutally executed.

Shiri was also reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans in the late 1990s and has been accused by Zimbabwean opposition politicians of overseeing military assaults on illegal mineworkers in diamond mines east of the country.

âBlack Jesusâ

Shiri infamously referred to himself as âBlack Jesusâ, reportedly because he âcould determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or notâ, said an anonymous source to the BBC.

âI am deeply saddened to inform the Nation of the death of the Minister of Agriculture, Air Chief Marshall (rtd) Perrance Shiri, a long time friend and colleague. Cde Shiri was a true patriot, who devoted his life to the liberation, independence and service of his countryâ, Mnangagwa said in a statement.

Shiriâs deputy Vangelis Haritatos, also paid tribute to him and said he was an extremely hard worker and was dedicated to serving his nation.

However Zimbabweâs former Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo said it was sad that victims of the massacre couldnât receive justice.

âItâs tragic that Perence Shiri has departed without facing justice over the gukurahundi atrocities he committed in Matabeleland & Midlands provinces in the 1980s; nor telling the truth about those atrocities to help heal the nation. May God rest Shiriâs victims in eternal peaceâ, he said.

Ousting Mugabe

Shiri was part of the Zimbabwean Defence Forces which surrounded the home of then President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 and subsequently demanded his resignation. The army hasmaintained that his ousting was not a result of a military coup, however analysts have disputed this, citing the nature of the transition of power to Mnangagwa. Shiri subsequently took up a cabinet post under the new administration.",0
479,"Commonwealth Games Scam

Commonwealth Games is an international meet of sports in which a number of events are held. Initially, it was known as the British Empire Games but later the name was changed and it is held in every 4 years.

This means that the next Commonwealth Games will be held in 2022. Athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations can participate in it. In the year 2010, it was held in India and though the nation was able to put up a spectacular show before the globe, it definitely held its head in shame internally because of the scam that followed the grand affair.

Commonwealth Games shook everyone

The President that time was Pratibha Patil while Congress was the ruling party. It is no secret that there have been a number of scams when the Congress was ruling the nation, however, the massive amount involved in the Commonwealth Games shook everyone. It totally changed the thought that India is a poor country.

It is reported that the expenditure to organize the magnificent show at Delhi was nothing less than INR 70,000 crores. There were a number of people involved behind the success and months of planning had been put in. but, here is exactly where the catch it.

Representing Commonwealth Games Scam

It is said that it is absolutely not true that the government actually spent so much. It is said that the officials of the government actually lied and created fake documents. There are accusations that a number of people in high posts and positions misused their power and actually presented tampered records of the expenditure done. They filled their pockets at the cost of the public. The bills and prices shown were definitely inflated. In fact, it has been investigated and actually found that just 50% of the stated amount was actually spent.

The nation then wishes to know that what happened to their hard-earned money. This is because it is the taxes paid by the common man that was spent on just pomp and show.

The nation still demands to know that if so much can be spent on games and just to maintain the reputation of a nation on an international scale, then why can the government not take any necessary steps and utilize this money to provide education to the masses and start industries on their own so that the mass scale problem of unemployment in India can be fought back without any issues.

The CommonWealth Scam of India

In fact, this is not it. The Commonwealth scam of India has also received international news space. This was because though the officials had been careful enough to spend on the fireworks and the lights, they had miserably failed in providing adequate facilities to the sports persons.

Conclusion

In fact, the same has been the complain of India players and sportsmen who are in a field other than cricket. Since news is timely, media soon moved their focus on to other news that came up. However, the masses have not forgotten this betrayal and are not likely to let go of it either. On the contrary, Suresh Kalmadi, one of the chief suspects for the scam, was appointed as the life president of Indian Olympic Association in 2016.",1
1061,"Iraqs new Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office after the countrys parliament approved a new government on Wednesday following nearly six months of political wrangling.

The parliament approved 15 ministers out of a prospective 22-seat cabinet in a vote of confidence. Five candidates were rejected while voting on two ministers was postponed, leaving seven ministries still empty, including the key oil and foreign affairs positions.

Two previous nominees for the role of prime minister  Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi and Adnan al-Zurfi  failed to secure enough support among cabinet ministers.

This led to President Barham Salih appointing al-Kadhimi as prime minister-designate last month as the third candidate to form a cabinet, amidst a backdrop of anti-government protests.

The protests began in October 2019 after thousands of Iraqis took to the streets and called for the overhaul of what they said was the countrys political and corrupt ruling elite.

Heavy-handed responses by the government security forces, which killed hundreds of protesters, forced then Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to resign, although he remained in a caretaker role until Allawi was appointed in early February.

Before the voting session on the new cabinet on Wednesday, al-Kadhimi said his government would be a solution-based, not a crisis government. He promised early elections and rejected the use of Iraq as a battleground by other countries.

The prime minister also pledged to address the repercussions of the economic crisis by rationalising spending and negotiating to restore Iraqs share of oil exports.

Early life

Born Mustafa Abdellatif Mshatat in 1967 in the capital Baghdad, he left Iraq in 1985 to Iran, before moving to Germany and the United Kingdom, which he later became a citizen of.

He holds a bachelors degree in law and is better known for his work as a journalist, where he chose the title of al-Kadhimi.

He was known to oppose the rule of the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, al-Kadhimi returned to Iraq and cofounded the Iraqi Media Network, running in parallel with his work as executive director of the Iraq Memory Foundation, an organisation founded for the purpose of documenting the crimes under Husseins Baath regime.

Al-Kadhimi also served as editor-in-chief of Iraqs Newsweek magazine for three years from 2010. He is also an opinions writer as well as the editor of the Iraq section of the US-based Al-Monitor website.

In June 2016, al-Khadhimi took over the role of director of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, in light of the intensification of the battles against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).

During his tenure, he forged links with dozens of countries and agencies operating within the US-led international coalition against ISIL.

During a rare visit to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, accompanied by former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, al-Kadhimi was seen in a long embrace with his friend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).

Al-Kadhimi is widely viewed by associates and politicians as having a pragmatic mentality in addition to cultivating relations with all the main players across the Iraqi political spectrum: a good relationship with the US, and another that has recently reached out to the Iranians.

Iran and its allied Iraqi Fatah political bloc had previously vetoed al-Kadhimis appointment.

Last month, Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed group close to Iran and linked to the Popular Mobilization Units, issued a statement accusing al-Kadhimi of having blood on his hands for the deaths of its leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, and accused him of collaborating with the US.

However, with the oil price crash and the coronavirus pandemic, compromises were made between the Fatah bloc and al-Kadhimi who said he will uphold the muhasasa, or political apportionment system.

Introduced in Iraq after the 2003 US-led invasion in an attempt to provide proportional government representation among Iraqs various ethno-sectarian groups, many Iraqis believe the system is deeply flawed and acts as a conduit for corruption and political patronage.

According to Iraqi political analyst Hisham al-Hashimi, al-Kadhimi faces no easy task in getting the country back on its feet again.

I dont doubt his ability on the technical issues such as forming equitable laws and a fair commission, al-Hashimi told Al Jazeera.

He will succeed in preparing for early elections, but the timing is not on his side due to the dire economic conditions and the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.",0
69,"Five fraudsters who offered a âgreen' tax efficient investment scheme to wealthy investors in order to steal millions from them have been ordered to pay Â£20,611,738.

The Oxbridge alumni used their former positions as a conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, a solicitor and merchant banker to persuade wealthy investors to put money into their âgreenâ investment scheme.

Investors were told their money would be spent on research and development into carbon credits, but only Â£16 million of the Â£65 million was actually spent on planting trees.

Instead the group stole Â£20 million of the investorsâ money and laundered it via bank accounts and secret trusts, spending it on luxury properties in London, Australia and Dubai as well as hidden off-shore investments. They also failed to pay around Â£6.5million in tax.

On Friday 13 December at the Old Bailey, Michael Richards, Rodney Whiston-Dew and Evdoros Demetriou have been ordered to pay Â£17.7 million collectively and if they fail to return the funds in the next three months, they face further time in jail. At an earlier hearing Robert Gold and Jonathan Anwyl were ordered to repay Â£2.64 million and Â£253,934 respectively.

Manjula Nayee of the CPS said: âThese men used their elite background to persuade people to part with their money, resulting in a huge loss to the victims and the public purse.

âSeizing these assets shows that we will do everything we can to ensure that criminals do not profit by exploiting others.â

The criminal benefit
To determine how much these men had profited from their scam âgreenâ scheme, the prosecution had to consider issues around ownership of different properties, international trusts, the corporate veil, tainted gifts as well as the effect of inflation, given the offences happened over 12 years ago.

They had laundered the proceeds internationally, hiding funds in accounts across China, the British Virgin Islands, Greece and Switzerland, which all had to be taken into consideration as part of the confiscation proceedings.

The vast amount of evidence gathered to support the case for their benefit amounts resulted in an opening argument of more than 100 pages for a heavily contested hearing which lasted two weeks.

The defence presented materials to show that each money launderer had little in the way of available assets, but the CPS was able to show these claims were false by identifying Â£20,611,738 of available assets.

Manjula Nayee continued: âIt is thanks to the dedication of every member of the prosecution team that worked on this case that, we could be confident the defendants had nowhere to hide. Now they must pay the millions they owe or face further time in jail.â

440,"The president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, was charged on Thursday by Swiss federal prosecutors in connection with a wider bribery investigation linked to World Cup television rights.

The office of Switzerlands attorney general filed an indictment charging Khelaifi with inciting former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement. The Qatari football and television executive, however, no longer faces an accusation of bribery.

Following a three-year investigation, Fifa reached an amicable agreement with Khelaifi last month, prosecutors said, to drop its criminal complaint relating to the awarding of 2026 and 2030 World Cup rights to Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports. Khelaifi is the head of Doha-based BeIN Sports and also a member of the Uefa executive committee.

I have been cleared of all suspicions of bribery and the case has been dismissed definitively and conclusively, said Khelaifi in a statement. While a secondary technical charge remains outstanding, I have every expectation that this will be proven completely groundless.

While I have cooperated with all authorities during the legal process, the three year investigation has been characterised by constant leaks, misinformation and a seemingly relentless agenda to smear my reputation in the media  completely irrespective of the facts and the notion of due process. For that reason, I have requested the relevant Swiss authorities to open a criminal enquiry into the conduct of the investigation.

Khelaifi was indicted for his alleged part in providing Valcke, who had influence over the awarding of World Cup rights until being removed from office in 2015, with use of a luxury villa in Sardinia without paying rent valued at up to 1.8m. Valcke was charged with accepting bribes, several counts of aggravated criminal mismanagement and falsification of documents. Valcke has denied wrongdoing. In 2017 his lawyer said Valcke disputes all the allegations.

For the first time in the five-year investigation of Fifa business, Swiss prosecutors revealed that they believe Valcke received kickbacks totaling 1.25m to steer World Cup rights toward favoured broadcasters in Italy and Greece.

A third person who was not identified was charged with bribery over those payments and also for inciting Valcke to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement.

Khelaifi was appointed to the Uefa executive committee, representing European clubs, one year ago despite being implicated in the bribery case. He is also an influential board member of the European Club Association, which is seeking to drive reforms in the Champions League to favour elite clubs such as French champion PSG.

He denied wrongdoing after being questioned in 2017 and 2019 in connection with criminal proceedings opened three years ago.

Khelaifi has also been implicated in a separate corruption investigation by French prosecutors that is linked to Qatar seeking hosting rights for the track and field world championships. Doha hosted the 2019 edition.",1
606,"One of Hong Kongs most strident pro-democracy figures has been arrested and the offices of the newspaper he owns searched by police in a stark escalation by authorities enforcing a new national security law brought in by Beijing.

The raid on Apple Daily, Hong Kongs largest pro-democracy daily paper, and arrest of Jimmy Lai and other senior executives were condemned by activists and journalists, who said they marked the day press freedom officially died.

Apple Dailys publisher, Next Digital Media, said it was furious about the raid and arrests. It warned that press freedom was hanging by a thread but said its staff remained committed to defending it.

Lai, a 71-year-old media tycoon and outspoken supporter of Hong Kongs pro-democracy movement, was arrested alongside six others including his son on Monday morning on suspicion of collusion with foreign forces and conspiracy to commit fraud.

In a separate incident the pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow was also arrested under the new law, her fellow activist Nathan Law said.

Hong Kong police said nine men and one woman, aged between 23 and 72, had been arrested.

Hundreds of police descended on the Apple Daily building in an unprecedented hours-long raid, which was live-streamed by dozens of the papers staff.

Tell your colleagues to keep their hands off until our lawyers check the warrant, the editor-in-chief, Ryan Law Wai-kwong, told police. Staff were ordered to produce ID. Midway through the raid a handcuffed Lai was marched through the newsroom.

Thousands watched the streams, which appeared to contradict police claims that news materials would not be targeted, as officers casually rifled through papers on journalists desks. Boxes of documents were confiscated.

Later, police barred news organisations including Reuters, Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and the public broadcaster RTHK from attending a press conference about the search.

The Hong Kong journalist association head, Chris Yeung, said the raid was horrendous. I think in some third-world countries there has been this kind of press freedom suppression, I just didnt expect it to be in Hong Kong, he told media.

Next Digital accused police of abusing their power and authorities of breaching press freedom through intimidation and creating an atmosphere of white fear.

The arrest of Lai, while not unexpected, has alarmed the city, which has been on edge after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law outlawing sedition and secessionist activities, and foreign collusion.

Lai, who also holds UK citizenship, is the most high-profile figure detained under the law. If charged and convicted, he could face potential sentences of three to 10 years in prison  or up to life for an offence of a grave nature.

In 2019 state media labelled him one of a new Gang of Four conspiring against Beijing. He is already facing several charges over involvement in last years pro-democracy protests, and he was one of 25 people charged on Friday over attending a Tiananmen Square massacre vigil in June.

A report in hawkish Chinese state media mouthpiece the Global Times labelled Lai a modern-day traitor and suggested he was unlikely to receive bail and would face heavy penalties.

Hong Kong journalists have repeatedly warned that the law would have a chilling affect on local media.

The activist and legislator Eddie Chu Hoi-dick accused the Chinese Communist party of wanting to close Apple Daily, and said Lais arrest was the first step of [a] HK media blackout.

Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator and a former journalist, said she was more surprised by the raid than the arrest. This is just so drastic and blatant, she told the Guardian.

Keith Richburg, a veteran correspondent and now head of Hong Kong Universitys media school, said the raid and arrests were outrageous. I think you can say that is the day press freedom officially died, and it didnt die a natural death. It was killed by Beijing and it was killed by Carrie Lam and Hong Kong police, he said.

The police operation marked the first time the law has been used against media in Hong Kong, which has historically had a high level of press freedom. Last month the New York Times announced it was moving part of its Hong Kong bureau to South Korea.

Several outlets have complained of foreign journalist visas not being renewed. On Monday the Standard news website reported that the immigration department had established a national security unit to vet sensitive visa applications, including from journalists.

Chinese and Hong Kong officials had promised the security law would not impinge on the citys civil freedoms, including its independent press. Todays police action upends those assurances, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong said in a statement.

Benedict Rogers, a co-founder and the chair of Hong Kong Watch, said: To arrest one of the most moderate, peaceful and internationally respected voices for democracy in Hong Kong  sends the message that no one is safe in Hong Kong unless they stay completely silent and do exactly as Xi Jinpings brutal regime says.

There was some speculation that the arrests were retaliation for US sanctions against senior Hong Kong officials, including Lam. The accusations against Lai have been at least partly driven by his meetings with and support from senior US figures including the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.

In response to the US sanctions, Chinas foreign ministry on Monday said that it would be placing sanctions on 11 US officials and lawmakers. A foreign ministry spokesman condemned the US for its blatant interference in Chinas internal affairs.

On Monday afternoon the stock price of Next Digital, which is owned by Lai, rose more than 300% after some analysts reportedly said they would buy in protest against his arrest.",0

1080,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday put the blame of its failure to completely crack down on money laundering and terror financing on the United States and said Washington was not actively supporting its bid for membership of a global alliance.

In its capacity as co-sponsor, the US was not actively supporting Pakistans request for membership of the Egmont Group  a club of financial intelligence units (FIU) of 156 nations, said Syed Mansoor Ali, the Director General of Pakistans Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU).

Ali made the statement in a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that had called officials of the State Bank and the finance ministry to get an update on Pakistans request for the groups membership.

The Egmont Group provides a platform for the secure exchange of expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Money laundering: FIA books Altaf Hussain for 'misusing KKF funds'

The official said in reply to a question that he did not know the reason behind the lacklustre US support for Pakistans membership. It is mandatory for an applicant state to seek the sponsorship of two members of the Egmont Group and the US and Japan had given their consent to Pakistans application.

Ali said both the US and Japans FIUs had visited Pakistan in November 2012 for observing the FMUs facilities and systems.

The Financial Action Task Force  an inter-governmental body working to combat money laundering  recommends that its members seek the membership of Egmont Group also.

In September 2011, the federal cabinet permitted the initiation of the process of seeking the Egmont Groups membership. It also approved allowing the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) and Japans Financial Intelligence Centre (JAFIC) to sponsor Pakistans membership.

Pakistan applied for the groups membership in 2012 and the FINCEN and JAFIC conducted the onsite visits of the FMU. On the basis of their report, the Operation Working Group of Egmont technically cleared Pakistans membership, said Ali.

NAB urged to probe money laundering allegations against Chinese company

However, the Legal Working Group of the organisation found some deficiencies in Pakistans Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act and rejected the application, he added.

Ali said that unlike foreign FIUs single-stage agreement, the FMU was following a two-tier system for sharing information. Pakistan addressed this legal objection in December 2015 by amending the AML law and adopting the single-stage agreement with the counterparts for the exchange of information.

Pakistan had shared the latest status with both Japan and the US, requesting them to resume the process of its membership, he said. But the US is not actively taking up our request and we do not know the reasons, said Ali.

Implications

The FMU and the law enforcement agencies are not able to completely analyse or investigate money laundering and terrorism financing cases wherever foreign jurisdictions are involved, according to the units written statement shared with the standing committee.

Zardari's aide facilitated Ayyan in 'money laundering', says ASF official

It added that mostly illicit money emanating from Pakistan due to corruption and organised and other serious crimes went out of the country.

The assets acquired in Pakistan or abroad through illicit proceeds could be traced on the receipt of intelligence from the foreign FIUs or sharing of information with them, it added.

Absence of any mechanism to exchange financial intelligence with other FIUs leaves us devoid of the opportunity to trace back the suspicious transactions having international dimensions, according to the FMU statement.

The platform of the Egmont would help the FMU in analysing the suspicious transactions and tracing the proceeds of crime, uncovering criminal assets across member countries by following the trail, thereby helping the FMU and LEAs in successfully combating the menace of money laundering and terrorist financing, it said.

I have got an impression during my interactions with foreign dignitaries that Pakistan was resisting to be part of Egmont Group, said Saleem Mandviwalla, the committees chairman. He asked the finance ministry to actively pursue the case and report back to the committee next month.

Mansoor Ali said the groups membership was very important for Pakistan and expressed the hope that the country might be able to get it next year. He said that despite engagements with the US, there had been no productive results so far.",0

A fierce online controversy is unfolding around a young Chinese celebrity Zhou Zhennan, as his wealthy parents were revealed to owe hundreds of millions of yuan in debts.

What's the story?

Zhou Zhennan, a 20-year-old singer, has more than 10 million followers on Weibo following success on a talent show. He has often hinted that he is from a rich and privileged family and has repeatedly shown off his palatial family villa complete with three maids.

However, in recent days multiple media sources have reported that Zhou's father, Zhou Yong, has been on a government blacklist of dishonest persons subject to enforcement since 2016, which means he is restricted from buying certain luxury goods or flying first class. On top of this, Zhous fathers companies have allegedly accumulated debts worth hundreds of millions of yuan.

Also, a property complex sold by Zhou Senior has come under considerable criticism from residents. Supposedly the buildings are of low quality with bricks falling off walls, and sewage overflowing in the basements.

Zhou Zhennan posted an apology on Weibo on Oct 26, saying that he knew nothing of his parents' situation, adding (Ill) help my father overcome these difficulties and help all the people who have been affected to recover their losses.

What are people saying online?

Although the legal experts have noted that Zhou Zhennan has no legal obligation to take responsibility for his father's liabilities, furious netizens have criticized him and have urged him to pay back his fathers debts. One typical comment read, You and your parents live in a big villa and enjoy a luxurious life while those victims are living in rotten buildings. Zhou Zhennan, come out and pay back the money!

Many of Zhous fans have stuck by him, but other social media users refuse to believe that he was unaware of his parents behavior especially in light of the fact that people on the list have audible alerts when their phones ring so that others know they have been blacklisted. Your parents are restricted from high-spending behavior, cannot fly first class, and you can even hear the special alert tone when their phones ring; how could you not know? another popular comment read.",0
330,"Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Leslie R. Caldwell, and Assistant Director Grant Ashley of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division announced today that David W. Delainey, former chief executive officer of Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, has pleaded guilty to insider trading.

Delainey, 37, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Kenneth Hoyt at U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Delainey pleaded guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with insider trading, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 78ff and 78j(b). As part of his plea agreement, Delainey has agreed to cooperate fully with the government's ongoing criminal investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation.

Delainey faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million at his sentencing, which will be scheduled at a later date. Delainey has agreed to forfeit all interest in more than $4.25 million in net proceeds from the offense to which he is pleading guilty.

""Today's guilty plea shows that the tireless work of the Enron Task Force is continuing to hold accountable those who participated in the massive fraud at Enron,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division. ""At the same time, securing the cooperation of the CEO of a major Enron business unit is an important step forward in the thorough and continuing investigation of this sophisticated corporate fraud.""

As described in the indictment and plea agreement, Delainey knew of and participated in aspects of a scheme by Enron's senior managers from at least 1998 through late 2001 to deceive the investing public about the nature and profitability of Enron's businesses and thereby to inflate the share price of Enron's stock. Delainey admitted that the fraudulent scheme included the improper reserving of hundreds of millions of dollars of unreported earnings to hide volatility in Enron's earnings and improperly set aside earnings for later use; the use of excess profits generated in one business unit's California energy trading to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of losses in another business unit; the manufacturing of earnings through fraudulent over-valuation of assets; and the structuring of financial transactions using improper accounting techniques in order to meet budget and earnings targets set by top Enron management.

Delainey further admitted that based on material non-public information in his possession, including Enron's fraudulent accounting schemes, he sold Enron stock for net proceeds totaling $4,256,006.67 at various times between January 10, 2000 and January 11, 2001.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigations Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. The Task Force investigation is continuing.",1
83,"Penny Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, served as U.S. commerce secretary during President Barack Obamaâs second term. A longtime friend and backer of Obama, Pritzker has been a major donor to Democratic candidates and causes. To comply with federal ethics requirements, Pritzker committed to sell her interest in more than 200 companies within 90 days of assuming her Cabinet position.

In the data

On Dec. 7, 2011, a tax accountant associated with the Pritzker family provided Appleby with a copy of Penny Pritzkerâs passport to confirm her identity to enable transactions involving offshore entities that held portions of her family investments.

Two Bermuda-based firms â IAS Holdings and Triton Container International Ltd. â emerge in numerous Appleby files related to Pritzker family transactions.

Pritzkerâs investments in the two firms were included in a federal ethics filing in which Pritzker pledged to sell investments to avoid conflicts of interest. Federal ethics law limits Cabinet membersâ ability to âpersonally and substantiallyâ participate in government matters that could affect their financial interests.

Documents show that on June 27, 2013 â two days after her confirmation â Pritzker transferred shares in IAS Holdings and Triton Container to Delaware-registered DRBIT Investors LLC, which Appleby documents identify as being âowned by trusts that are for the benefit of Penny Pritzker's children.â A separate Appleby document lists DRBIT Investorsâ mailing address as the same as Pritzkerâs investment firm, PSP Capital. On the ethics form Pritzker filed the following year, IAS and Triton are simply listed as having been sold.

Penny Pritzker also showed up in Applebyâs records as shareholder of the Bermuda company THL Ltd. Pritzkerâs ethics agreement states that her stake in THL, listed as worth between $500,000 and $1 million, was sold on the same date she transferred shares in IAS Holdings and Triton Container to DRBIT Investors.

Pritzkerâs ethics forms value her interest in IAS Holdings at between $15,000 and $50,000 and her shares in Triton Container at between $1 million and $5 million at the time of the sale.

A Bermuda tax assessment sent to Appleby in July 2011 identifies IAS as an âexemptedâ company, meaning that it is exempt from local taxes, and notes that it will be subject to no new taxes until March 31, 2035.

The Regulation is among the precautions taken in the last two weeks to provide for a legal infrastructure which will enable Government officials to respond strongly to those who have been involved in the coup attempt by making it possible to block suspicious fund transfers.",0
656,"Position under Edward VI and Mary

With her fatherâs death in 1547 and the accession to the throne of her frail 10-year-old brother Edward, Elizabethâs life took a perilous turn. Her guardian, the dowager queen Catherine Parr, almost immediately married Thomas Seymour, the lord high admiral. Handsome, ambitious, and discontented, Seymour began to scheme against his powerful older brother, Edward Seymour, protector of the realm during Edward VIâs minority. In January 1549, shortly after the death of Catherine Parr, Thomas Seymour was arrested for treason and accused of plotting to marry Elizabeth in order to rule the kingdom. Repeated interrogations of Elizabeth and her servants led to the charge that even when his wife was alive Seymour had on several occasions behaved in a flirtatious and overly familiar manner toward the young princess. Under humiliating close questioning and in some danger, Elizabeth was extraordinarily circumspect and poised. When she was told that Seymour had been beheaded, she betrayed no emotion.

The need for circumspection, self-control, and political acumen became even greater after the death of the Protestant Edward in 1553 and the accession of Elizabethâs older half sister Mary, a religious zealot set on returning England, by force if necessary, to the Roman Catholic faith. This attempt, along with her unpopular marriage to the ardently Catholic king Philip II of Spain, aroused bitter Protestant opposition. In a charged atmosphere of treasonous rebellion and inquisitorial repression, Elizabethâs life was in grave danger. For though, as her sister demanded, she conformed outwardly to official Catholic observance, she inevitably became the focus and the obvious beneficiary of plots to overthrow the government and restore Protestantism. Arrested and sent to the Tower of London after Sir Thomas Wyattâs rebellion in January 1554, Elizabeth narrowly escaped her motherâs fate. Two months later, after extensive interrogation and spying had revealed no conclusive evidence of treason on her part, she was released from the Tower and placed in close custody for a year at Woodstock. The difficulty of her situation eased somewhat, though she was never far from suspicious scrutiny. Throughout the unhappy years of Maryâs childless reign, with its burning of Protestants and its military disasters, Elizabeth had continually to protest her innocence, affirm her unwavering loyalty, and proclaim her pious abhorrence of heresy. It was a sustained lesson in survival through self-discipline and the tactful manipulation of appearances.

Many Protestants and Roman Catholics alike assumed that her self-presentation was deceptive, but Elizabeth managed to keep her inward convictions to herself, and in religion as in much else they have remained something of a mystery. There is with Elizabeth a continual gap between a dazzling surface and an interior that she kept carefully concealed. Observers were repeatedly tantalized with what they thought was a glimpse of the interior, only to find that they had been shown another facet of the surface. Everything in Elizabethâs early life taught her to pay careful attention to how she represented herself and how she was represented by others. She learned her lesson well.",0

Spanish police have said two former IRA members - a married couple - were arrested last week as part of an investigation into money laundering and smuggling.

It has been reported that the couple are Leonard Hardy, 54, and Donna Maguire, 57.

They were arrested in Lanzarote.

Five other people were arrested and 11 searches were carried out in the provinces of Las Palmas, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia.

Spanish police said inquiries began following information indicating that money from tobacco and alcohol smuggling was being laundered through the acquisition of properties in different Spanish provinces on the Mediterranean coast and the creation of companies.

They said it involved properties with an estimated value of 10.5m euros.

The investigation has been assisted by Irish police and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

Hardy and Maguire are married with four children and live in Dundalk, County Louth.

Hardy, originally from Belfast, received a six-year sentence in Germany in 2006, after admitting his role in a failed IRA bomb attack on a British Army barracks at Osnabruck in August 1989. He walked free because the offence happened before 1998.

767,"Angolan President, JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o, renewed last Thursday, in Luanda, his commitment to the fight against corruption, stressing that this evil has already damaged the Angolan State by at least US $24 billion.
âWe say at least because as the investigations around some ongoing processes and their likely protagonists are taking place, new things are being discoveredâ, said the statesman, during the message on the State of the Nation.
According to JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o, it is likely that later, much larger numbers will be announced, which in itself already exceeds the value of Angola's debt to its main creditor.
Government data indicate that, in the context of the asset recovery process, the State has already recovered real estate and money worth more than USD 4.9 billion, of which more than USD 2.7 billion in cash.
The other part, estimated at more than USD 2.1 billion, results from the seizure of real estate, factories, port terminals, office buildings, housing buildings, radio and television stations, graphic units, commercial establishments and others.
The fight against corruption and impunity is one of the banners of President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o's governance.
However, it is part of the governmentâs measures to ensure the creation of a more favourable environment for private investment.

829,"Harmonisation of rules and requirements throughout the European Union (EU) would help to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) efforts in an effective manner, eliminate existing regulatory fragmentation and ensure a unified European approach, according to the Bank of Lithuania.

âWith requirements for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing continuously growing more rigid and given the free movement of financial services within the single market, everyone needs more clarity and precision. This would help financial market participants operating both in Lithuania and other EU countries to expand their activities in the single market,â said Marius Jurgilas, Member of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.

On 7 May 2020, the European Commission adopted an action plan for a comprehensive Union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing and launched a public consultation. The action plan builds on six pillars, including developing a single EU rulebook for combating money laundering and terrorist financing and creating an EU level supervisory framework (mechanism).

According to the Bank of Lithuania, common rules, especially in areas such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, would bring more clarity both to financial market participants and supervisory authorities.

Currently, rules and requirements for market participants as well as supervisory practices in EU Member States vary, which gives rise to numerous questions concerning their treatment and uniform application. A common approach, possibly in the form of regulations, would help to tackle this issue.

Should a new authority be established to tackle this issue across the EU, it is important to ensure that it does not duplicate the work of national supervisory authorities, does not give rise to disproportionate administrative costs and strikes a good balance between national and European responsibilities, it added.

The central bankâs position was submitted in the framework of the European Commissionâs public consultation on the review of the EU legal framework on AML/CTF.",0
242,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been rebuked by the U.S. Ethics Office after selling his stake in a film production company, which heâd promised to divest from, to his own wife, Louise Linton. Whoops!

The office said that, because of this, they wonât certify Mnuchinâs 2018 financial disclosure statement, according to a Thursday report in the New York Times. Mnuchin has promised to distance himself from the company, and wonât face any penalties for the sale.

From the Times:

Mr. Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then-fiancÃ©e, Louise Linton, as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary. Since they are now married, government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr. Mnuchin, potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China. [...]

Mr. Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms. Linton, an actress and producer. However, the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it.

Mnuchin isnât the first Trump official to be scorned by the ethics office. Just last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also told that his disclosure statement couldnât be certified because of an inaccuracy.

An attorney for the Treasury Department, Brian J. Sonfield, wrote a letter to the Ethics department this week explaining that Mnuchinâs sale had been cleared by the department, and that he believes the sale is âconsistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations.â

Mnuchin has now promised he will recuse himself from any business that could potentially have an impact on the production company.

But not having your financial records certified by the ethics office is a big deal, and extremely rare, according to the Times.

This isnât Mnuchinâs first ethics scandal. Last year, for instance, the Center for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington found that Mnuchin had âbetween the spring and fall of 2017, [taken] eight separate trips on military aircraft at a total cost of nearly $1 million.â

âThose records make clear that Secretary Mnuchin has legitimately earned a place in the roguesâ gallery of cabinet secretaries who have abused their all too easy access to military and other non-commercial aircraft for both business travel and what, upon closer inspection, appears to sometimes include personal travel,â the group said at the time.

Democrats pointed out that whatever Mnuchin says, his actions were a violation of his promise to divest from the company.

âBefore being confirmed by the Senate, he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L.L.C.,â Senator Ron Wyden, the highest ranked Democrat on the Finance Committee, told the Times. âRather than divest, he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then-fiancÃ©e and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage.â",1
688,"Netacea, a provider of bot management solutions, today announces that ClearScore, the UKâs leading free credit score and credit marketplace, has selected Netaceaâs bot management solution to protect against credential stuffing attacks and account takeovers.

Netaceaâs Intent Analyticsâ¢ engine can quickly and accurately distinguish bots from humans, which allows ClearScore to give genuine users access and stop malicious bots. The partnership sees ClearScore advance its online security from web application firewalls, rate limiting, and similar techniques to a more sophisticated machine learning-based solution that can quickly evolve to protect against the current threat landscape of bots.

ClearScore provides its users with simple access to their credit score and report for free and provides financial product recommendations tailored to their credit report. Its ClearScore Protect product also provides âdark web monitoringâ that can check if passwords and usernames have been stolen and are being traded online. It is exactly this sort of trading that Netacea helps protect ClearScore fromâbots use credentials stolen in data breaches to gain access to accounts elsewhere. These attacks can then be used to commit further fraud or subvert existing accountsâfor example applying for a loan in someone elseâs name.

ClearScore found that keeping ahead of this fraud was proving increasingly difficult using standard techniques. For example, more sophisticated bots can avoid rate limiting measures by keeping just below thresholds, and while traffic from certain countries is more likely to be malicious, limiting IP addresses can keep genuine users out. In the last four weeks, Netacea has reduced traffic to login pages by 14% by mitigating bot traffic. In addition, the internal ClearScore security team, previously required to carry out late night manual blocking of suspicious traffic to minimise threats, is now free to tackle other concerns.

âAt ClearScore, we deal with highly sensitive credit report data every minute of every day. In the wrong hands, this data has the potential to have a negative impact on our usersâ personal finances, so we go to great lengths to ensure their data is safe with us. Though our security systems are extremely robust, itâs critical that we protect against user credentials that have been stolen from elsewhere on the Internet being used for account takeover. As a fast-growing business, itâs critical that we maintain our usersâ trust to continue our growth.

âSolutions such as rate limiting and blacklisting IP addresses are only of limited use and can prevent genuine users from gaining access. Working with Netacea means we can stay one step ahead of criminals even as they change how they operateâand we can focus on giving our users the best possible service.â",0
392,"The Premier League striker at the centre of a £1.1million tax fraud investigation is involved in a business whose shareholders include Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish and the head of the one of the most powerful sports agencies in the British game.

Brighton and former Palace striker Glenn Murray, and his wife Stacey, were arrested on Tuesday, with HMRC officers searching their Sussex home. The couple were later released.

Sportsmail can reveal that Murray, his agent Will Salthouse and Parish are shareholders in a chicken restaurant business called Dirtybird Restaurants Limited.

A statement from HMRC confirmed a couple's arrest, adding: 'The man was arrested on suspicion of evading income tax and VAT, and cheating the public revenue. The woman was arrested on suspicion of evading income tax, and cheating the public revenue.'

HMRC said 'business and personal records were seized during the operation'.

The investigation is ongoing but Sportsmail has uncovered details about Murray's business dealings and that of his representative Salthouse at Unique Sports Management. It is understood that HMRC may be examining one of the transfers during the career of Brighton's leading goalscorer.

HMRC would not comment any further on Thursday and the Daily Mail understands that revenue officers had not contacted any officials at Crystal Palace in relation to their former player.

Murray has long been represented by USM, a sports management agency which lists Salthouse as its major shareholder.

On Thursday Salthouse confirmed that Murray was managed by USM but declined to answer any further questions, including enquiries concerning his own stake in Dirtybird Restaurants Limited and the fact that he lists players as shareholders in his USM business. While that is not in breach of any regulations if a player's stake remains below five per cent, football industry insiders do consider such a practice unusual.

In accounts documents listed at Companies House in October 2017, Dirtybird had net assets of more than £2.6m. And in the most recent annual return, filed with Companies House in June 2016, it was stated that Parish had 8.3 per cent of the business with Salthouse, Murray and Wayne Routledge each holding 1.4 per cent.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Parish, or indeed Salthouse, Murray and Routledge, the Swansea City footballer who also has shares in USM.

But asked on Thursday if his shares in Dirtybird represented a conflict of interest when Salthouse has been involved in at least eight Crystal Palace transfers since 2015, Parish declined to comment.

Salthouse, Murray and Routledge invested in Dirtybird following an allotment of shares issued by the company in May 2015. Parish was already a shareholder.

An Anthony Titus is listed at Companies House as a shareholder at USM. It is unclear if Anthony Titus is in fact Dexter Blackstock  the former Southampton and England under 21 forward now acting as an agent who has close links with Salthouse  but Anthony and Titus are Blackstocks middle names. Keith Andrews, the former Irish international footballer, also had a share in USM, but it ended in 2016.

In December 2016 Marlon Fleischmann, who lists Harry Kane among a stellar list of clients, joined USM as a director but what caused more ripples in the football industry was the recruitment of two key figures from the FA.

Until October 2015 Martin Fauvel was a financial regulation officer at Wembley but he caused considerable concern among football agents when he informed them, via email, of his intention to cross the divide into their world and join USM. On Friday he will be listed as the head of operations at USM with a brief to ensure 'legal and regulatory compliance for the company'.

Fauvel was followed 14 months later by Ian Ryder, a former Metropolitan Police detective who was working at the FA as the football integrity and anti-corruption manager.

On LinkedIn Ryder says he is an intermediary for 1st Sports Management but he confirmed on Thursday that he also works on a consultancy basis for USM. He even has a USM business card.

Concern among other football agents centred on the access Fauvel and Ryder might have had to sensitive information about contracts between agents and their players, given that all representation agreements between footballers and intermediaries are lodged at Wembley under FA regulations.

While there is no suggestion such information has been used to USM's advantage, they have become one of the most powerful agencies in the game. USM's last unaudited accounts at Companies House state net assets of £4.48m.

An Irish agent called Eamonn Collins has represented Blackstock in the past, and is understood to be a business associate of Salthouse's. Together with Fleischmann, Collins and Salthouse are listed as directors of a company in Dublin called Cluainweir Limited.

In August 2016 the Brazillian authorities issued arrest warrants for Collins, himself a former footballer, and two other men as part of their investigation into alleged ticket touting at the Rio Olympic Games. The men denied any wrongdoing.

The allegations against those involved, with former Olympic Council of Ireland president Pat Hickey among them, include ticket touting, money laundering and tax evasion. Brazil's Supreme Court suspended the case last November.",1
36,"A judge told the disgraced former MP that he had âthrown away his good name and characterâ with âblatant dishonestyâ and âliesâ.

Despite a high-flying job as a junior environment minister, the 58-year-old fraudulently claimed Â£800-a-month interest on mortgage payments on his constituency home in Lincolnshire.

MPs are allowed to claim interest on their mortgages, but the actual monthly interest Morley paid was only ever between Â£6 and Â£52.

He even carried on claiming the Â£800 after his mortgage was paid off.

In total he claimed Â£32,000 when, under parliamentary expenses rules, he was only entitled to Â£1,572.

At Londonâs Southwark Crown Court Mr Justice Saunders said: âI am satisfied from the nature of the mortgage transactions and the correspondence that the excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable, even in part, by oversight.

âThe continuation of the claim for Â£800 a month after the mortgage had been redeemed can properly be described as blatant dishonesty.â

He added: âThe results of this case are tragic for the defendant and his family. He has thrown away his good name and good character.â

Morley, a father of two who was elected MP for Scunthorpe in 1987 and stood down before last yearâs general election, admitted two counts of false accounting.

The admission made him the first minister and most high-profile politician to be caught in the scandal.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said under parliamentary expenses rules, Morley was entitled to claim mortgage interest on his second home in Winterton, Lincs.

But, in fact, the Liverpool-born MP âengaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses systemâ, submitting a total of 40 fraudulent claims.

Between May 2004 and February 2006, he submitted 19 claims worth Â£15,200, and between March 2006 and November 2007 he submitted 21 claims totalling Â£16,800.

After receiving a letter from the parliamentary fees office, Morley explained his behaviour as an âembarrassing and inadvertent oversightâ.

Jim Sturman QC, mitigating, said that Morley had paid back the full amount owed immediately.

He said: âThis is a tragic end to a lifetime of public service. He has done an enormous amount of good, often for no pay.

âHeâs made a grotesque error of judgment.â

Mr Justice Saunders said Morley avoided a longer jail sentence despite claiming more money than other MPs who had also been convicted over the expenses scandal because of the lack of sophistication of his fraud.

He said: âWhile this defendant is charged with obtaining more money than any other MP and over a long period, the degree of sophistication involved in carrying out the fraud was less than in some other cases.â

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayersâ Alliance, said: âMorleyâs jail sentence is justice for taxpayers whom he cheated and stole from.

âThe damage done by the MPsâ expenses scandal is still being repaired and it will take time to restore the publicâs trust in the system, but this is another step down that road.

âThis sentence sends a clear message that even a former minister is not above the law, and stealing from the taxpayers he was supposed to represent is a very serious crime.â

A Labour Party spokesman said: âElliot Morley had already been suspended from the Labour Party and following his custodial sentence, he has now been excluded.â",1

Former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and former Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda watch the annual military parade at Zocalo main square, in Mexico City, Mexico.
(CNN)A former Mexican defense minister was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on drug and money laundering charges, accused of taking bribes in exchange for permitting a cartel known for wholesale violence to operate with impunity in Mexico, federal prosecutors said Friday.
General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Secretary of National Defense in Mexico from 2012 to 2018, has been indicted on four counts, including international heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana manufacture and distribution conspiracy, importation and distribution conspiracies, and conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.
?

One year after being sentenced, 'El Chapo' is hoping an appeal can get him out of Supermax, his lawyer says
Federal prosecutors said Cienfuegos Zepeda allegedly assisted the H-2 cartel, which was previously led by the late Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez, also known as ""H-2,"" and based in Nayarit and Sinaloa, Mexico.
		
""The defendant abused that public position to help the H-2 Cartel, an extremely violent Mexican drug trafficking organization, traffic thousands of kilograms of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States, including New York City,"" federal prosecutors said in a letter supporting a motion for a permanent order of detention against the defendant. ""In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartel -- a cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murder -- to operate with impunity in Mexico.""
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter Thursday night that he was informed of the detention by US Ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau.
The general appeared in federal court Friday and has been ordered to remain in US custody until a formal detention hearing is held for him next Tuesday. Prosecutors will ask for his transfer to New York. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""It is a very regrettable fact that a former defense secretary is detained, accused of drug trafficking,"" Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly known as AMLO, said during his daily press briefing on Friday.
Falko Ernst, a Mexico-based security analyst for the Crisis Group, said the arrest was ""a very stark reminder that the incorruptibility of the armed forces -- the myth that they're somehow protagonists of the 'war on drugs' and simultaneously uncompromised by it -- has little to do with on-the-ground realities.""
?

""It is also a reminder that there is no such thing as a clear line between state and crime, which undermines the very notion that this is a winnable war with clear enemy categories,"" Ernst said via WhatsApp Friday. ""It should thus remind us how badly needed new, and better solutions that go beyond force alone are. The current approach -- ever-greater militarization -- has failed dramatically.""
Cienfuegos Zepeda served as defense minister under President Enrique Peña Nieto, who left office two years ago.
In the letter supporting the motion for a permanent order of detention, federal prosecutors accuse Cienfuegos Zepeda of using his position to ensure that military operations were not conducted against the H-2 cartel, initiate operations against rivals, locate maritime transportation for drug shipments, help expand the territory controlled by the cartel and introduce senior cartel leaders to other corrupt Mexican government officials.
The general also warned the cartel about US law enforcement investigations and informants, prosecutors wrote. In one instance, an H-2 cartel member whom the organization incorrectly believed to be an informant was murdered, according to the letter.
The evidence against the general includes ""thousands of Blackberry Messenger communications"" between him and a senior cartel boss as well as other organization members, according to the letter.
Cienfuegos Zepeda's detention comes less than a year after the US arrest of Mexico's former public security secretary, Genaro Garcia Luna, who held the post from 2006 to 2012.
Garcia Luna, who was arrested by federal agents in Dallas, Texas, last December, was charged in a drug trafficking conspiracy that involved receiving millions of dollars in bribes from imprisoned drug cartel kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to federal prosecutors. Garcia Luna has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
AMLO on Friday defended the armed forces, calling them ""incorruptible"" and ""pillars of the Mexican state"" while blaming former administrations of what he called the ""neoliberal period"" when tens of thousands of Mexicans were killed in drug-related violence and cartel warfare.
In May, AMLO ordered the armed forces to return to the streets in an attempt to reduce violence by primarily targeting organized criminal groups. The move was controversial because he won the presidency on a platform of demilitarizing the country's long-running war against drug cartels.
		
Previous administrations also deployed the military against the cartels. The resulting violence has left hundreds of thousands of dead in Mexico since 2006.

381,"Embattled lender Metro Bank has been hit with a fresh lawsuit by a group of Iranian customers who say their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.

The group of 17 claimants, who are expected to seek at least £1.5m in damages, include dual British-Iranian citizens, Iranian citizens living in the UK and several UK-based businesses including an engineering firm and a consultancy.

Law firm Ronald Fletcher Baker said its clients were blocked from accessing their accounts and cash between May and September 2019 without notice and without explanation. It first contacted Metro about the issue in July and served the bank with legal papers last week.

Rokhsareh Vahid, a sanctions and banking specialist at the law firm, said: Our clients are all UK residents and they have made it clear to Metro Bank that they did not use their accounts in an unlawful or illegitimate manner.

Metro Bank has not alleged that any of the claimants were involved in any illegal or illegitimate activities and it has released the restrictions on some accounts during this process, which effectively confirms that our clients were not involved in any wrongdoing, she added.

Vahid said her clients suffered financially and one business had been forced to lay off staff after its accounts were restricted for nearly two months.

She said: One can imagine how difficult it would be for individuals to meet their financial responsibilities when their account is suddenly restricted without an explanation and the restriction continues for so long.

The legal threat is the latest headache for Metro, which is also facing a US class action suit over an accounting blunder on its loan book between March 2018 and May 2019. It was filed after the lender revealed the error involving the misclassification of £900m of loans as less risky than they were. The lender is awaiting the result of a regulatory investigation linked to the error. Metro Bank has said that it plans to vigorously defend itself against the class action.

Metro is also reviewing its compliance controls after breaching US sanctions in Iran and Cuba between 2017 and 2019. There is no evidence to suggest that the breaches and the account suspensions referred to in the latest lawsuit are related.

Commenting on the fresh lawsuit, a Metro Bank spokeswoman said: Metro Bank takes its responsibilities, in line with UK regulations, to ensure the integrity of the UK financial system and protect it from financial crime, very seriously. Metro Bank will defend itself vigorously should this go any further.

Any potential trial is expected to take place in mid-2021.",0

Introduction
Corruption probes that began in 2014 have reached the highest levels of the Brazilian government and corporate elite, implicating President Michel Temer, former presidents, and dozens of cabinet officials and senators. Operacao Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) and overlapping investigations have led to prison sentences for top executives and politicians, mass layoffs, and billions of dollars paid in fines.
The scandals have complicated efforts to revive the economy amid its largest downturn in more than a century. The countryâs biggest corporations have faced numerous setbacks, and the fallout from the scandals helped right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro sweep to victory in Brazilâs 2018 presidential election on a populist, anticorruption platform. Millions of Brazilians have demonstrated in favor of the investigations, and many hope that shedding light on the scandals will end the widespread corruption that has plagued their country.
What is Lava Jato?
Federal prosecutors led by Judge Sergio Moro launched Lava Jato in March 2014, after the Finance Ministryâs intelligence unit discovered unusual bank transactions involving the state-owned oil company Petrobras. They suspected that Petrobras was accepting bribes from firms, including the construction giant Odebrecht, in exchange for contracts.
Executives from both Petrobras and Odebrecht, including the latterâs former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, were sentenced to jail time. In April 2017, a U.S. federal court ordered Odebrecht to pay $2.6 billion in fines to authorities in Brazil, Switzerland, and the United States. The company had previously admitted to paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to officials in twelve countries. Facing financial losses that stem in part from the probe, the two companies have laid off more than one hundred thousand employees.

Â Â 
According to the public prosecutorâs office, by October 2018 Lava Jato had resulted in more thanÂ two hundred convictionsÂ for crimes including corruption, abuse of the international financial system, drug trafficking, and money laundering.Â More than a dozen other corporations and multiple foreign leaders have also been implicated in Lava Jato, including former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and former Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Another investigation, Operacao Carne Fraca (Operation Weak Flesh), was announced publicly in March 2017; it began as a result of Lava Jato and pursued allegations that employees of JBS and BRF, the worldâs largest beef and poultry exporters, respectively, bribed food inspectors to approve the sale of spoiled products. In the following months, the European Union suspended its meat imports from Brazil, along with China, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, and the United States. (Some of the bans were lifted soon thereafter, but EU and U.S. restrictions remain in place.) JBSâs heads, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, made plea bargains with prosecutors and resigned from their positions in May; their testimonies spurred a probe into President Temer. JBSâs controlling shareholder agreed that month to pay a record $3.16 billion fine after its executives admitted to bribing 1,829 politicians a total of nearly $600 million. The Batistas were arrested in September on charges of lying to the prosecution and insider trading.
Several other corruption probes that have overlapped with Lava Jato have resulted in more than a dozen arrests. These include:Â Operacao Panatenaico, which concerns alleged bribes paid by construction companies in exchange for contracts to build stadiums for the World Cup Brasilia hosted in 2014;Â Operacao Greenfield, an investigation into alleged fraud at the pension funds of state-run companies; andÂ Operacao Zelotes, which is looking into bribes allegedly paid by companies including JBS and Fordâs Brazilian subsidiary to tax officials to reduce their corporate liabilities.
Which current or former public officials have been investigated?
Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin has authorized prosecutors to open investigations intoÂ hundreds of individualsÂ named in testimony by Odebrecht employees as part of their plea deals. The list included four former presidents, eight ministers, some seventy members of the National Congress, and three governors. The most prominent politicians among those investigated include:
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Â The former president (2003â2011) was sentenced by Judge Moro in July 2017 to nine and a half years in prison for corruption and money laundering. Lula, who also faces charges in several other corruption cases, lost appeals and had his prison sentence extended to twelve years in early 2018. His loss of these appeals effectively barred him from running for political office, although his party subsequently named him as its presidential candidate in the 2018 election. LulaÂ ended his presidential bidÂ in September and endorsed former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, who lost to Bolsonaro in a runoff. The federal prosecutorâs office has referred to Lula as the mastermind behind the entire corruption scheme targeted by Lava Jato, and some officials from his administration are serving prison sentences for related crimes. He is often described as a mentor to his successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was his chief of staff from 2005 to 2010.
Dilma Rousseff.Â In office since 2011, President Rousseff was impeached and then removed from office in 2016, during her second term, after being charged with manipulating the federal budget to conceal the size of the countryâs deficit. Prosecutors never brought charges related to the Petrobras scandal against Rousseff, though she was the companyâs chairwoman from 2003 to 2010. A separate case, which was brought by the opposition, sought to annul Rousseff and Temerâs 2014 election victory over allegations of illegal campaign donations, but was unsuccessful.
Michel Temer.Â Rousseffâs one-time running mate and vice president took office in August 2016, after Rousseff was impeached. His name did not appear on Fachinâs list, but he has since been charged with taking bribes. JBS chair Joesley Batista handed over to investigators secretly recorded audio that purports to show Temer authorizing hush money for Eduardo Cunha, a former speaker of Congressâs lower house. Like Rousseff and Lula, Temer has denied the allegations against him.
Eduardo Cunha.Â Cunha was charged in October 2016 with accepting bribes worth $40 million and attempting to obstruct investigations into his activities. In March 2017, he was sentenced to more than fifteen years in prison for corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering. Cunha faces additional criminal charges as well.
Sergio Cabral.Â The former governor of Rio de Janeiro state was arrested in November 2016 on charges of accepting $64 million in bribes in exchange for construction contracts, including for World Cup stadiums. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison in June 2017.
Have the probes had economic consequences?
Brazilâs economic troubles predate Lava Jato. Initially thought to be a temporary downturn in the wake of playing host to the World Cup, Brazil fell beginning in early 2014 into its worst recession in more than a century. As the political crisis worsened, investment levels and consumer confidence suffered, leading to a 3.9 percent drop in GDP in 2015 and another 3.6 percent decrease the following year.
In the first half of 2017, Brazil saw its first quarter-on-quarter growth in two years, at 1 percent. But after the Temer recording was released in May, Brazilâs currency, the real, plummeted 8 percent, andÂ economists indicatedÂ that political turmoil would make it more likely that the country would sink back into recession. Unemployment in Brazil hit a new high in March 2017 at 13.7 percent, more than double the rate in late 2013, prior to the start of Lava Jato.
By the end of that year, though, Brazilâs economy showed initial signs of recovery. The Finance Ministry announced that GDP hadÂ grown an estimated 1.1 percentÂ in 2017, citing a drop in private sector debt and increases in investment and consumption. Unemployment and inflationÂ were fallingÂ and the benchmark interest rate was at anÂ all-time low of 7 percentÂ in December.
Temer has pressed Congress to approve a massive economic reform program that includes austerity measures meant to rein in government debt, which continues to rise. However,Â experts doubtÂ that he can move forward with reforms amid corruption investigations. Multiple iterations of Temerâs pension reform bill haveÂ floundered in Congress.
Meanwhile, the companies at the center of the scandals, some of the countryâs largest, have been confronted with deep financial consequences. By mid-2018, the corruption scandal was believed to have helpedÂ erase more than $250 billionÂ from Petrobrasâs market value. The oil giant has also lost billions more in legal settlements and other costs related to graft, including anÂ $853 million settlementÂ with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Brazilian authorities.
Where does the Temer administration stand?
Brazilian legislation provides sitting cabinet members and other federal elected officials with special standing; they can only be tried by the STF. Cases against politicians move slowly through the single court, which has traditionally been deferential to politicians, leading to âpractical immunity from prosecution,â writes Matthew M. Taylor, an expert on Latin American politics at American University.
In June 2017, the prosecutor-general charged the president with corruption for accepting a $152,000 bribe from Batista, and in September with obstruction of justice and racketeering. The charges failed to obtain the two-thirds approval required by Congress for it to move forward in the STF, and Temer survived anÂ impeachment voteÂ in August of that year. Even so, at least eight cabinet ministers or top aides have stepped down since Temer took office due to the revelations from Lava Jato and other probes. âHis kitchen cabinet has been decimated,â says Taylor. Several smaller political parties have withdrawn their support for the Temer administration.Â Â Â 
[Temerâs] kitchen cabinet has been decimated.
Â Matthew M. Taylor,Â American University
Â Â Â 
In December 2017, Temer sparked outrage by reducing the minimum amount of prison time required for nonviolent criminals to be considered for an annual presidential pardon.

UN Narrative Summary

137,"When at the end of May French prosecutors filed preliminary charges against Qatari businessman Yousef al-Obaidly in connection with suspected bribery, the quake rippled all the way to the United Nations headquarters in New York.

Al-Obaidly, chief executive of BeIN Media, was charged in connection with suspected bribery so that his country would be successful in its bid to host the track and field world championships and the 2020 Olympic Games. French newspaper Le Monde reported in November 2016 that a former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) official received two payments totaling around $3.5M from Qatari investors before the vote for the 2017 world championships host nation.

According to the Guardian, ""disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, just before the $3.5M payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.""

The payments were made by Oryx Qatar Sports Investments. Al-Obaidly's media company profited substantially from broadcasting and licensing rights, because BeIN Media is closely linked to the fund. The IAAF Championships were eventually awarded to London, but the ongoing investigations highlight Qatar's flagrant disregard for international law and its use of government-sanctioned bribery.

Even Qatar's own anti-corruption unit appears to be corrupt.

The chairman of the board of trustees of the Qatar-based ""Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Center"" (ROLACC), Ali Bin Fetais Al Marri, who is also the country's attorney general, owns several properties that are substantially outside what a civil servant in Qatar would be able to afford. On a salary of a maximum of $12,000 per month, Al Marri has been able to purchase a â¬9.6M ($10.6M) mansion in Paris, close to the Arc de Triomphe, a CHF7M ($7.1M) villa in Cologny, Geneva's most expensive neighborhood, and an office in Geneva for CHF3.69M ($3.74M), which Al Marri rents out to the ROLACC dependence in the Swiss city.

How the ROLACC founder â and apparently chief corruption-fighter in Qatar â has been able to profit privately from letting his Geneva property to his anti-corruption agency is unclear. The office at Route de Ferney 221 was purchased in November 2015 through GSG Immobilier SA, of which Al Marri holds 99%.

ROLACC and Al Marri are of international significance, and it risks making a mockery of the U.S.-backed United Nations. Indeed, ROLACC signed an agreement on fighting corruption in sports with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in January this year â two months before the charges against Yousef al-Obaidly were first made by the French courts.

In 2017, the U.S. was the second main funder of the UNODC. American taxpayers should not be subsidizing unaccountable international civil servants who sign partnerships with dodgy organizations. In particular, the U.S. delegation to the U.N. should use its significant power to reform the UNODC. Congress should also revise its financial support to the UNODC in the face of state-sponsored corruption in Qatar.",1
224,"MEXICO CITY â

Federal agents called in the Mexican army to arrest one of the nationâs most powerful drug barons, a man wanted in the 1993 murder of Guadalajaraâs Roman Catholic cardinal, during a late-night raid that also snared 33 federal agents who were protecting him, authorities said Saturday.

Mexicoâs attorney general said Hector Luis Palma Salazar, reputed leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in an exclusive neighborhood of Guadalajara and charged with several murders and drug-related crimes.

Palma allegedly took over one of the five major cartels that U.S. drug enforcement agents say transport three-fourths of the cocaine entering the United States after its previous leader was jailed in the murder of the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. Palma was also wanted in connection with that crime, and the Mexican government had posted a $1-million reward for information leading to his capture.

The arrests late Friday were seen as a clear sign of President Ernesto Zedilloâs commitment to crack down on the cartels. They also underscored the close ties that exist between drug kingpins and some federal officials.

Confirming Palmaâs arrest at an evening news conference in Mexico City, Atty. Gen. Antonio Lozano said the army was called in as a precaution because federal police were directly involved with Palma.

Mexican soldiers formed a cordon around the Guadalajara office of the federal attorney general--to guard against retaliation--while agents from Mexico City arrested Palma, along with Apolinar Pintor Aguilera, the federal judicial police commander. Jalisco state authorities said Palma identified Pintor as his âprotector.â

Authorities also detained 33 federal police officers who they said had been serving as Palmaâs personal bodyguards. Lozano said his agents seized large quantities of drugs and about $10,000 in cash.

Palma was reportedly a lieutenant of Joaquin (Chapo) Guzman, former leader of the cartel in Sinaloa, a state notorious for violence and marijuana production. U.S. and Mexican officials said the cartel has extensive networks in Central and South America and has been instrumental in exporting Colombian cocaine into the United States through Mexico.

Authorities said Palma became the cartelâs leader after Guzmanâs arrest in 1993. Guzman has also been charged with participating in the murder of Posadas, who was shot more than a dozen times in what the previous government called a case of mistaken identity.

Lozano, the first attorney general to come from an opposition political party, has vowed to arrest the leaders of all the major cartels and to solve several high-profile political murders, among them the killing of the cardinal.

Religious leaders and human rights groups have cast doubt on the official version of the slaying on March 24, 1993, outside the Guadalajara airport. Posadas was an outspoken critic of the drug cartels that Mexican and U.S. drug enforcement officials say have infiltrated the government at high enough levels to threaten the nationâs stability.

Officials now say the airport slaying, in which six others died, was masterminded by the Arellano Felix brothers and their Tijuana drug cartel, a rival of Palmaâs Sinaloa cartel. One of the four brothers, Francisco Arellano Felix, has been captured, but the three others remain at large. There is a $1-million reward for information leading to the arrest of any of the brothers.

Authorities have not released details of what roles Guzman and Palma allegedly played in the cardinalâs assassination.

The cardinalâs slaying was the first in a series of political murders that caused billions of dollars in investment to flee the country, helping to trigger Mexicoâs continuing economic crisis and fueling national insecurity.

A year after Posadasâ death, ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was slain in Tijuana. And six months after that, the partyâs secretary general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot to death in Mexico City.",1
609,"(Reuters) - U.S. television presenter Ed Henry denied allegations of sexual misconduct after being fired by Fox News over claims of willful sexual misconduct involving a co-worker from years ago.

The cable news network owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp FOXA.O said on Wednesday it had dismissed the co-presenter of weekday news program ""America's Newsroom"" after receiving a complaint on June 25 from the lawyer of a former employee which prompted the network to retain an outside law firm to investigate.

Henry was suspended on the day of the complaint and was fired based on investigative findings, according to an internal memo that Fox News provided Reuters.

""Ed Henry denies the allegations referenced in the Fox announcement and is confident that he will be vindicated after a full hearing in an appropriate forum,"" Henry tweeted here on Wednesday, quoting his lawyer Catherine Foti.

The former employee has not been identified. Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who said he represented the former employee, said: We cannot comment at this time.

Former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes resigned in 2016 after being accused by former employees of sexual harassment. Those claims formed the basis of the 2019 feature film Bombshell starring Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie.",1

866,"Alex Stamos rose to fame as the chief security officer for Yahoo and then Facebook. But today heâs the director of Stanfordâs Internet Observatory, where heâs immersed in teaching and researching safe tech â and understands better than most the threats that the U.S. is facing, particularly as we sail toward the next U.S. presidential election.

Last night, at a StrictlyVC event in San Francisco, he talked with New York Times cybersecurity correspondent Sheera Frenkel about a small number of these massively impactful issues, first by revisiting what happened during the 2016 president election, then catching up the audience on whether the countryâs defenses have evolved since. (The short version: they havenât. If thereâs any good news at all, itâs that the federal and state governments are at least aware now thereâs an issue, whereas they appeared largely blindsided by it the last time around.)

What worries Stamos most are âdirect attacks on our election infrastructureâ because thereâs been so little to bolster it. In fact, a big theme of the interview was the growing inability of the public sector to protect Americans or U.S. democracy against actors who would do the country harm.

As it relates to election infrastructure specifically, Stamos used a hyperlocal example to underscore what the U.S. is dealing with right now. As he told Frenkel, âI live in San Mateo County. Iâve met the CIO of San Mateo County. Really nice guy. Iâm sure he has a staff of very hard-working people. The idea that the CIO of San Mateo County has to stand up and protect himself against the [Russian military intelligence agency known as the] GRU or Chinaâs Ministry of State Security or Iranâs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Lazarus Group of North Korea . . . thatâs frickinâ ridiculous. Like, we donât ask the San Mateo County Sheriffâs Department to get ready to repel an invasion by the Peopleâs Liberation Army, but we ask for the cyber equivalent in the United States.â

Put into perspective, San Mateo County is one of about 10,000 local governments in the United States that are involved in elections, said Stamos. âNobody else in the world runs their elections this way.â

In fact, in nearly every conceivable way, âresponsibilities that were once clearly public sector responsibilities are now private sector responsibilities,â he told Frenkel during a later part of their discussion. He would know, having seen it first-hand.

âWhen I was the chief security officer at Facebook,â he told the audience, âI had a child safety team. We probably put more bad guys away than almost any law enforcement agency outside of the FBI or [Homeland Security Investigations unit] in the child safety realm. Like, thereâs no local police department in the United States that put away more child predators than the Facebook child safety team. That is a crazy stat.â

Facebook also has a counter-terrorism team â which not everyone realizes â and which has become in many ways the countryâs first responder, he suggested. Indeed, Stamos said that âthere are several terrorist attacks that youâve never heard of because they didnât happen because we caught them. Now, thereâs some local law enforcement agency that took credit for it, but it was actually our team that found it and turned it over to them with a bow on it.â

Americans might shrug off this continuing shift in who is tackling what, but they do it at their peril, suggested Stamos â who managed to keep the crowd laughing, even as he painted a bleak picture. As he noted, the big tech âcompanies are exercising this power without any kind of democratic oversight.â Consider, he said, that â[Facebookâs] authorization is the terms of service that people click through and never read when they join Facebook or Instagram. Thatâs a bizarre set of rules to be bound by when you have such incredible power.â

Another huge blind spot, said Stamos, is the apparent inability â as well as the collective lack of determination required â of the public and the increasingly powerful private sector to coordinate their work. Here, he offered another broad example to make it accessible. âSay you had an organized group in the United States thatâs running a bunch of Facebook ads, but their money is coming from bitcoin from St. Petersburg,â said Stamos. âThat is completely invisible to Facebook. That is perhaps visible to the FBI . . . but they donât have access to that actual content [on FB]. And figuring out a way for these two groups to work with each other without massively violating the privacy of everybody on the platform turns out to be super hard.â

Yet itâs worse than even that sounds, he continued. The reason: thereâs no decision-tree in part because the issue has grown so unmanageable that no one wants to own what goes awry. âThereâs effectively nobody in charge of this right now, which is one of the scariest things weâre facing as a country. Almost nobody is in defense of cyber, and certainly nobody is in charge of the big picture, [meaning] how do we defend against election [interference] both from a cybersecurity perspective and a disinformation perspective.â

Stamos even jokingly referred to âpockets of people in the U.S. government who are effectively hiding from the White House and trying very, very hardâ to escape its attention, given the daunting job theyâd be tasked with figuring out. Except, all kidding aside, with no one at the helm and âno real cross-agency process, thereâs really nobody in charge,â said Stamos.

That means the âtech companies are effectively the coordinating body for this. And thatâs actually really screwed up.â",0
342,"Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers and U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced the unsealing of a six-count federal indictment against Seyed Sajjad Shahidian, 33, Vahid Vali, 33, and PAYMENT24 for conducting financial transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit offenses against and to defraud the United States, wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. Shahidian, who was arrested and extradited from the United Kingdom, made his initial appearance earlier today before Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Vali remains at large.

According to the allegations in the indictment, PAYMENT24 was an internet-based financial services company with approximately 40 employees and offices in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, Iran. The primary business of PAYMENT24 was helping Iranian citizens conduct prohibited financial transactions with businesses based in the United States, including the unlawful purchase and exportation of computer software, software licenses, and computer servers from United States companies. According to PAYMENT24âs website, the company charged a fee to circumvent âAmerican sanctions,â and claimed to have brought in millions of dollars of foreign currency into Iran.

According to the allegations in the indictment, beginning in or before 2009 through November 2018, Shahidian, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of PAYMENT24, conspired with Vali, the Chief Operating Officer of PAYMENT24, and other individuals to commit offenses against the United States by violating the restrictions on trade and exports from the United States to Iran. On its website, PAYMENT24 sold a package to assist its Iranian clients with making online purchases from United States-based businesses, which included a PayPal account, a fraudulent âID card and address receipt,â a remote IP address from the United Arab Emirates, and a Visa gift card. The PAYMENT24 website also offered its clients advice on how to create accounts with a foreign identity and how to avoid restrictions on foreign websites, including advising clients to ânever attempt to log into those sites with an Iranian IP address.â

As part of the scheme, Shahidian and Vali made material misrepresentations and omissions to United States-based businesses regarding the destination of the United States-origin goods. In order to accomplish the transactions, Shahidian obtained payment processing accounts from United States-based companies using false residency information, fraudulent passport documents, and other false documents fabricated using the identity and personally identifiable information of another person.

Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized exports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States or by a United States person are prohibited.

This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Minneapolis Division of the FBI. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs secured the extradition from the United Kingdom with significant assistance from law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy C. Rank and Charles J. Kovats of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Divisionâs Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.",1

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used her new seat on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday to deliver an impassioned argument for campaign finance reform and stronger government ethics laws.

The New York Democrat posed a creative series of questions to ethics experts in an attempt to expose how a corrupt, self-interested lawmaker could avoid accountability in Congress.She called it the ""Corruption Game.""

""Let's play a lightening round game, I'm gonna be the bad guy and I want to get away with as much bad things as possible, ideally to enrich myself and advance my interests, even if that means putting my interests ahead of the American people,"" Ocasio-Cortez began.

She then asked the panel of ethics experts whether she could use ""special interest dark money"" from corporate PACs to fund her theoretical campaign, dole out hush payments to keep adversaries quiet, write laws that benefit her donors, and then buy stocks in companies that would benefit from those laws.

They said she could do all of the above.

Ocasio-Cortez went on, ""Is it possible that any elements of this story apply to our current government and our current public servants?"" she asked.

When the experts responded in the affirmative, Ocasio-Cortez asked whether the ethics regulations pertaining to the president are stricter than those in Congress.

""There's [sic] almost no laws at all that apply to the president,"" said Walter Shaub, the director of the Campaign Legal Center and former head of the US Office of Government Ethics.

""So it's already super legal for me to be a pretty bad guy, but it's even easier for the president of the United States to be one,"" she concluded.

The hearing revolved around sweeping legislation known as HR 1, the ""For the People Act of 2019,"" introduced by House Democrats last month that includes anti-corruption reforms and measures that would make it easier to vote.

The bill also seeks to reduce the influence of big money in elections with a publicly-funded matching system for small-dollar donations to congressional campaigns.

Ocasio-Cortez campaigned heavily on her call to reform campaign finance laws and get big money out of politics. Like a growing number of Democrats, she banned corporate PAC money from he campaign. Around 62% of the $2 million Ocasio-Cortez's campaign raised in the 2018 cycle came from donations of $200 or less, according to Open Secrets.Ocasio-Cortez delivered her questioning after some Republicans on the committee, including the top GOP member Rep. Jim Jordan, criticized HR 1 as a ""wish list for Democrats.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently called the bill a ""power grab"" and the ""Democrat Politician Protection Act.""

McConnell was widely mocked by critics.

Sen. Brian Schatz a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted, ""Voting is a power grab. By citizens.""

In what could be interpreted as a jab at President Donald Trump, the bill also includes a requirement for presidential and vice-presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Trump has broken years of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns.Watch the full video here:",0
760,"Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday his government would review cooperation over drug policy with the United States and how its agencies operate in Mexico after the recent U.S. arrest of a top military official. Lopez Obrador's comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

""We have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEA's historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard also expressed dismay at the United States' failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos. ""We have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),"" Lopez Obrador said.

""But there are still issues we want to clarify. We're only waiting for the elections to pass,"" he said of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term. Lopez Obrador has held up the case of Cienfuegos, who is being held without bail, as an example of rampant corruption in past governments. But he characterized the case as an ""isolated"" event and defended the army's role in Mexico.

Cienfuegos was head of the army from 2012 to 2018.",0
53,"Georgia needs the port. And if it doesnât want to find itself sucked into a Chinese debt trap, it needs to stop tussling with Western investors. The arbitration filings came just days after Tbilisi backed down in another conflict with another investor, Frontera, an American oil company â under myopic pressure from Washington.

This latest escalation in the bitter public dispute over Anaklia is a blow to Georgiaâs national security for two reasons.

First, it is yet more evidence that Anaklia will not be built anytime soon; the arbitration process will make it difficult for the government to attract new investors. As the countryâs first deep-water port, Anaklia is an essential part of Georgiaâs plan to transform itself into a transit hub between Europe and Asia, a strategy intended to boost trade, integrate deeper in the Euro-Atlantic economic system, and ultimately pull Georgia out of Russiaâs sphere of influence.

The move by the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC) â which was founded by a rival to the head of Georgiaâs ruling party â came after the government blamed it for failing to raise enough money for the port and terminated its contract in January. ADC, for its part, maintains that the government made it impossible to attract investors.

The Anaklia saga also undermines Georgiaâs security by damaging its reputation as a safe place to invest. Georgian officials like to boast about their countryâs free trade agreements and high place in ease of doing business rankings. The ability to attract foreign investors not only spurs growth, it creates connections with American and European business communities and spares Georgia from having to accept predatory loans from China to build new infrastructure.

The ruling Georgian Dream party has always claimed it supports Anaklia. Behind the scenes, however, it has appeared to sabotage the project by refusing to provide guarantees to international financial institutions, and launching what smells like a politically motivated money laundering investigation against former ADC chairman Mamuka Khazaradze. Clearly there is a personal rivalry between Khazaradze, who has started his own political party, and the head of Georgian Dream, Georgiaâs de-facto leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.

The fact that such a strategically important project was derailed by domestic political squabbling does not reflect well on Georgia. Foreign firms will be less likely to invest there, especially in things like infrastructure projects which require long-term commitments. This should be a grave concern for Georgia, where FDI inflows have already fallen from an average of $1.8 billion per year between 2014 and 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019, according to government data.

Access to Western investors, businesses, and insurers â which requires those actors to believe they will be treated fairly â is a vital economic and security asset for Georgia. Investors bring more than capital and expertise; they form connections between business communities in Georgia and the West which in turn create political connections. If the steady march of bad press about Anaklia dissuades some Western firms from investing in Georgia, the country will be forced to choose between slower economic growth and new benefactors.

The obvious choice would be China, with its deep coffers and penchant for investing in dysfunctional countries along trade routes to Europe. This is not just a far-fetched hypothetical. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has cited the risk of Georgia âfalling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influenceâ as one reason Anaklia is so important. Chinese investment in Georgia would invite the same concerns about debt traps, a lack of transparency, and political influence that accompany Chinese investments everywhere.

Georgia is still a success story for democracy and free enterprise in a tough neighborhood. The Anaklia fiasco is a step backwards. Georgians must now recognize the danger of politicizing critical investments. Parliamentary elections in October are the perfect opportunity to voice support for Anaklia and for keeping their country open to foreign businesses.

Georgiaâs friends in Washington, meanwhile, should provide the kind of guidance that is based on principle, not favoritism. In April, Georgia prevailed in an arbitration dispute with Frontera, the American oil company, which the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration found had failed to pay wages and engaged in other unscrupulous behavior over the years. Instead of supporting Georgiaâs efforts to move on, some members of Congress (who took contributions from Frontera), tried to get the State Department to withhold aid to Tbilisi, tying â improbably â the Frontera dispute to Russia. Tbilisi had no choice but to cave.

Thatâs how Beijing and Moscow do business. If Washington wants Georgia to succeed as a transparent and free democracy, it should support the countryâs efforts to play by the rules â and support negotiations with the Anaklia Development Consortium.",0

293,"Daja (Uncle), is accused of being the leader of a well-structured criminal group which falsified documents, appropriated lands, bribed officials, and laundered money, according to an indictment submitted by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, prosecutor and obtained by Prishtina Insight.

The 264-page indictment, drafted by Italian Prosecutor Danilo Ceccarelli, which will be published by Prishtina Insight and BIRN Kosovoâs Albanian-language portal Kallxo in several installments, reveals how Sylaâs pension from Switzerland was allegedly used to finance the criminal group and sponsor group meetings in a Prishtina restaurant. The indictment also reveals the involvement of Kosovo Serbs in the group led by the former commander of Kosovo Liberation Armyâs, KLA, Headquarters.From a corner of a restaurant in Prishtinaâs Sunny Hill neighborhood, Azem Sylaâs âHQâ gave out orders, instructions, and guidelines for the other members of the group between 2006-2016, according to the indictment. The prosecution alleges that Azem Syla would sit at a table in the restaurant while his interlocutors would come and go, receiving various orders.The indictment, filed on October 24, accuses tens of individuals of misuse and appropriation of land in Prishtinaâs suburbs.Azem Syla, who was a member of the Kosovo Assembly during the 2010-2014 legislature, is on the top of the list of the accused. In the indictment obtained by Prishtina Insight, another 21 are accused of being members a group described by the indictment as one of the most active, well organized and long-lasting in Kosovoâs history.

In April 2016, criminal investigations resulted in a massive police raid by EULEX and Kosovo Police. On the morning of April 27, police raided Sylaâs personal compound but failed to apprehend him. A couple of days later, Syla surrendered to police. The prosecution filed two indictments, accusing two groups consisting of 22 and 17 people respectively, on various charges including organized crime, falsifying documents, bribery, fraud and money laundering.

The first count of organized crime accuses Syla and 12 others of having knowingly and intentionally committed serious crimes as part of a structured organized group, with the aim of obtaining financial and material benefits.In the indictment, Syla is described as the âorganizer, supervisor, manager and directorâ of the criminal group. The indictment also accuses him of: âcoordinatingâ and âsupervisingâ the entire operation; assigning other members their roles within a well-structured hierarchy; and approving or refusing operational proposals by the other members. Syla is accused of giving orders and instructions to the other members and asking for reports about the continuous criminal activities. He is also accused of participating in the âunderlying criminal offensesâ described by the indictment by giving instructions, guidance and approval, and receiving most of the profits from criminal activities.

Shaban Syla, who, like Azem Syla, was born in Kishnareke, played an almost identical role to the former MP. Syla, who in 2012 was found guilty for attempted murder of a member of the Kosovo Democratic League, LDK, as part of âthe Bllaca 2â case, is also described as an organizer, supervisor, manager and director of the criminal group. According to the indictment, Shaban and Azem Syla were constantly in touch with regards to strategic decision-making and planning.

âSpecifically, he [Shaban Syla] organized and managed all the actions aimed at identifying Serbian individuals who had verdicts and documents useful for the criminal activities, liaised with them and involved them in the organized criminal group; organized and coordinated the falsification of verdicts and of the related documents; identified the socially owned land parcels to acquire illegally; liaised with, and corrupted, officials in the Municipal Court, at the Cadastral Office and in other public offices in order to obtain the original documents to falsify, to receive favorable decision and to speed up the procedure,â the 2016 indictment says.

A similar role was played by Shpresim Uka, another defendant from the âBllaca 2â case, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder.

Ljubisa Vujovic, the only Serb indicted, was a member and supporter of the criminal group and actively participated in criminal activities.

âSpecifically, Ljubisa Vujovic provided the group with the original verdict no. 1164/90 dated 24 June 1992, which returned to his family the land parcel no.145 in Fushe Kosova, knowing that the group was going to falsify it replacing that parcel with others,â reads the indictment. Vujovic also supported the group by providing it with âfalse documents, photos, and personal data of his family members that were used to create false ID documents, authorization, power of attorney and Court certifications.â

Other Serbs involved in the criminal activities have not been indicted because they are unreachable to the prosecution, which suspects they are being sheltered in Serbia. Since Kosovoâs institutions are not recognized by Serbia, suspects have evaded justice in the past by fleeing to Serbia or northern Kosovo.

Thirty-nine people, including their alleged leader Azem Syla, were indicted on charges of organized crime, money laundering, bribery, aggravated fraud, fraud on duty, issuing illegal court decisions, abuse of duty, legalizing falsified content, and fiscal evasion.",1
89,"According to the authorities, the settlement is related to the bankâs âconduct in packaging, securitization, marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007.â

âThis resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,â said Acting Associate Attorney Stuart Delery. He added that the settlement includes a $1.8 billion commitment to help repair the damage to homeowners and communities that Goldman acknowledges resulted from its conduct. The fine also includes a $2.385 billion civil penalty and $875 million in cash payments.

âWe are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us. Since the financial crisis, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our culture, reinforce our commitment to our clients and ensure our governance processes are robust, â said a statement from Goldman Sachs.

Goldman is the last major American bank to settle with the government. In January, the bank disclosed that it had agreed a payment to settle âactual and potential civil claimsâ by the US Justice Department and the attorney generals of New York and Illinois, as well as state regulators. Goldman then said it had set aside funds for many of the charges. The bank has already paid $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

948,"Harald V king of Norway from 1991, succeeding his father, Olav V.

Harald was the youngest of three children born to Olav and Crown Princess Märtha. However, as the only son he became crown prince when his father assumed the throne in 1957. Harald attended the Norwegian Military Academy and Balliol College, Oxford, and attained the rank of captain in three branches of his countrys armed forces. Like his father he was a fine athlete and excelled at yachting.

Haralds courtship of a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, caused some controversy, and he reportedly threatened to never wed if the couple were prevented from marrying. Olav eventually gave his consent, and, after some nine years of dating, the pair were married on August 29, 1968. Harald and Sonja had two children, Märtha Louise (born 1971) and Haakon Magnus (born 1973).

Harald became king of Norway upon the death of his father on January 17, 1991. Although the succession law had been changed in 1990with the eldest child, whether male or female, assuming the throneit applied only to those born subsequently, and thus Haakon became crown prince. Like the duties of other Scandinavian monarchs, Haralds were largely ceremonial.",0
854,"In India, you donât really exist till youâre on the right WhatsApp groups. Itâs on those private chat rooms that political campaigns are sharpest; where Indiaâs sprawling extended families quarrel and make decisions; and, according to a recent Reuters investigation, where company quarterly results are predicted with surprising prescience. Thereâs no proof of insider trading yet, but officials from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi -- Indiaâs market regulator -- told the Economic Times that they were looking into the reports.

This is just another reminder of the fact that, while nominally Indiaâs financial markets are set up to protect ordinary investors and market participants, in actual fact they work to protect insiders. This isn't generally understood, given that Indiaâs laws against insider trading and protecting minority shareholders are strict on paper. In the World Bankâs ease of doing business indicators, for example, one of the few domains in which India has consistently done well is in the protection of minority shareholders.

But here, as elsewhere in India, thereâs a vast difference between what the laws say and how they're implemented. Indeed, Indiaâs Supreme Court recently chastised regulators, saying that their rules on insider trading simply werenât clear enough.

The WhatsApp story seems to confirm something of an open secret in Mumbai stock market circles: There are closed networks that tend to get information about companies well before the general public. Sebi struggles to get insider-trading prosecutions off the ground. Meanwhile, foreign investors operating in India are being forced to run investigations of their own local employees and contractors.

Even if Sebiâs regulations were up-to-date and detailed, enforcement would be hampered by staffing problems. The agency has only 780 employees, one for every six companies listed on an Indian stock exchange. (Fifteen times as many people work at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one for every company listed on an American exchange.) Nor does the training or background of Sebiâs employees necessarily inspire confidence.

Add to that a culture that has long normalized trading on insider information. I remember sitting, a few years ago, with an acquaintance of mine from one of Mumbaiâs old stock-broking families, a man then in his late 50s. We were talking of the prosecution in New York for insider trading of Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group LLC, and of Rajat Gupta, once a managing director at McKinsey & Co. Inc. After I carefully explained what Gupta and Rajaratnam had done, my acquaintance shook his head, bemused. How, he asked me, are traders expected to make money except by using their networks to unearth information nobody else has? Itâs no surprise, perhaps, that many ordinary Indians donât entirely trust the stock market, assuming it's loaded against them in some way.

A similar insider-first entitlement has led to an even larger corporate governance problem. What in India are called âpromotersâ -- those who control companies, frequently the firm's founding family -- have power far beyond what their actual ownership share warrants. They pay themselves exorbitant salaries, strip the publicly-held companies they control of assets, and have their decisions rubber-stamped by boards and sometimes even by shareholder meetings that donât have all the information.

After a couple of corporate scandals recently, Sebi set up a committee led by the well-respected banker Uday Kotak to investigate how governance could be improved. Kotak explicitly said that he saw his job as ensuring âfairness for the entire body of shareholders"" and not just a select subset. The committeeâs report called for multiple changes to how companies were regulated and how boards were constituted.

But it isnât that easy to make changes in India. At least one government minister said that the report was âcompletely off the mark."" And preventing insiders from taking control of companies would require Sebi to investigate the privately-held, or unlisted, subsidiaries of publicly-traded companies. Sebi doesnât have that power and it isnât certain that the Delhi ministry that does will give it up easily.

Kotak pointed out another open secret about the Indian private sector, too: Most activity at many publicly-traded companies was nominally carried out by unlisted subsidiaries -- and so wasnât audited, or transparent enough for the average shareholder to figure out. He could easily have added that some promoters tend to use unlisted subsidiaries to hide their control and to move money around in ways that shareholders or the government canât see.

Indiaâs government is hoping that more and more of its citizens will turn to the financial markets and shares as a vehicle for their savings, giving up on gold and on real estate. And, certainly, the marketsâ bull run has been one of the few good news stories in the Indian economy at the moment. But to keep that run going, India has to work harder to protect outsiders -- or, to put it another way, it will have to work harder to disempower insiders, by streamlining laws if necessary. Bureaucratic wrangling between regulators and the government shouldnât stand in the way.

988,"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi headed to Washington for the first time this week since taking office in May  the most high-profile stage of a ""Strategic Dialogue"" expected to re-calibrate US-Iraq relations. But as he left, the situation at home had become increasingly tense.

Prominent anti-government activists were gunned down by unknown assailants on three occasions in Basra this week, a jump that has alarmed human rights organizations. Attacks on US targets in the country, thought to be carried out by pro-Iran factions, intensified to an almost daily occurrence after the trip was announced. It comes as a lack of public services, corruption and economic and coronavirus crises feed into an overall feeling of anger and frustration.

""Kadhimi's visit to Washington clearly angered the Iranian side and its factions in Iraq, as strengthening Iraq-US ties does not benefit them,"" Iraqi journalist Azhar al-Rubaie told DW from Basra.

Among all the pressures he faces, balancing the influence of Iran and the US is crucial to whether al-Kadhimi, well-known to be close to the US, has the power to stay the course and stabilize the country.

A costly visit

The visit did yield a $200 million (169 million) US aid package and the announcement of energy and finance contracts. But it could also prove politically costly for the PM, alienating him from powerful pro-Iran elements at home.

""[Iran has] massive equities in the country. It's got the militias, it's got networks of influence, it's got politicians that it's bought and paid for,"" Toby Dodge, Research Director for Iraq at the London School of Economics, said. ""What al-Kadhimi needs to do is keep some distance from Iran, but he can't alienate them either.""

Many expected the withdrawal of some 5,000 US troops from Iraq to be top of the summit's agenda but with nothing new announced, their continued presence may be a reprieve for al-Kadhimi.

He wants some level of those forces to stay to fight Islamic State (IS) and support him in reining in the country's militias. Pro-Iran armed groups under the umbrella of the loosely government-controlled Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), established to oust IS, want them out. Many of its members are linked to politicians in Iraq's parliament, which voted in favor of a US withdrawal earlier this year.

Although US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to discuss how a withdrawal might happen, President Donald Trump has often stated his desire to pull out. ""We look forward to the day when we don't have to be there,"" he said Thursday.

""The tension is between Trump's transactional, instrumental view that [he] doesn't want to get entangled, and then Pompeo, who sees the fight against Iran as the most important issue in American foreign policy in the Middle East,"" Dodge said.

Read more: Why the US and Iran are not at war

But the future of US military presence in Iraq was never really up for discussion, according to Ramzy Mardini, an associate at the University of Chicago's Pearson Institute. Instead, after US strikes in January killed Iranian and pro-Iran Iraqi commanders, the strategic dialogue was seen as way to deal with growing anti-American pressure in Iraq, Mardini said on Twitter.

Support in question ahead of elections

Having angered pro-Iran politicians and armed groups, al-Kadhimi now faces an uphill battle going into elections next year.

After a new electoral law designed to break the power of larger political blocs was passed late last year, he's pushing for early polls.

""What he'll try and do is build an electoral coalition which guarantees that he'll come back into power after that,"" Dodge said. ""But I still think because of this Iranian hostility, because of suspicions that al-Kadhimi's too pro-American, he's going to find it difficult to get another term in office after those elections.""

Others still have faith he will be able to rein in the militias and bring stability to the country after the recent spate of attacks on activists.

""Al-Khadimi will definitely stop them because he is not loyal to any side and is taking bold actions no one has ever taken,"" an activist from Basra, who did not want to be named due to the security situation, told DW.

The prime minister's proposal to establish a ""supreme committee"" charged with investigating major corruption, crime and assassinations has given the activist hope.

""Killing you just for being different from [the armed groups'] dogma is something that security forces should deal with. All party leaders who are criminals should be tried to deliver us a safer environment to live in,"" the activist said.",0

47,"â -- A 27-year-old New York City-area woman has been accused of stealing and laundering more than $85,000, using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to support ISIS, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

Zoobia Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of money laundering. The five-count indictment was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York.

""The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" the DOJ explained in a statement. ""She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (""ISIS"") ... After consummating the scheme, the defendant attempted to leave the United States and travel to Syria. Shahnaz, a U.S citizen, was arrested yesterday.""

According to court records, Shahnaz worked as a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June of this year Around January of 2016, the government says she volunteered in Jordan with the Syrian American Medical Society.

Part of her volunteer work took her to a refugee camp where prosecutors said ""ISIS exercises significant influence.""

But Steve Zissou, an attorney assigned by the judge to represent Shahnaz, told Newsday that she never tried to help ISIS. He said she wanted to help Syrian refugees she met while volunteering.

""Whatever she did was for humanitarian purposes only,"" Zissou said.

Shahnaz is accused of fraudulently obtaining six credit cards and a loan from a Manhattan bank to procure more than $85,000 which prosecutors allege she then converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and laundered the money through overseas transfers, all with an intent to financially support ISIS. Prosecutors say the financial institutions she defrauded include American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Discover Bank and TD Bank.

Having never told her family she had quit her job in June, she attempted to board a flight at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport for Pakistan on July 31, with a layover in Turkey.

She was questioned by law enforcement officials at the airport, since her itinerary was suspect. Prosecutors said they believe she was trying to leave the U.S. for Syria and join ISIS.

""Her itinerary included a multi-day layover in Istanbul, Turkey -- a common point of entry for individuals traveling from Western countries to join ISIS in Syria,"" a court document stated. ""The defendant's return ticket had been booked for September 4, 2017 on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to JFK.""

But investigators believe Shahnaz had no plans to return to the U.S. She had allegedly done Internet searches for ""one-way tickets to Istanbul"" but purchased a roundtrip ticket. Prosecutors point out that ISIS recommends those wishing to travel to join ISIS to buy roundtrip tickets because they might be deemed less suspicious by law enforcement agents.

Agents said she gave false and conflicting explanations about her overseas wire transfers. She was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors want her held without bail pending trial.

Her next court date is January 5, 2018.",1
630,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's financial crime agency began investigating casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd CWN.AX on suspicion of failure to comply with anti money-laundering protocols, putting a planned resort opening under pressure and sending its shares tumbling.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said it began an enforcement investigation into Crowns main casino in Melbourne following a compliance assessment started a year earlier, without commenting further.

AUSTRACs concerns were focused on Crown Melbournes management of customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons, Crown said in a separate statement.

The investigation adds to an already sizable headache for the company 37% owned by billionaire James Packer as it pushes ahead with a plan to open a new casino in Sydney in December.

Another inquiry by a state regulator has been airing allegations of dysfunctional senior management, poor risk control and issuing false public statements.

The inquiry has already asked Crowns directors why the company is opening a casino during a review which will decide if it can keep its licence.

It was triggered by media reports in mid-2019 which accused Crown of doing business with casino tour, or junket, operators who had not been vetted for organised crime links. Crown initially denied the allegations in full-page newspaper advertisements but has acknowledged at the inquiry parts of the denial were misleading.

Shares of Crown fell 10% by late morning, compared to a higher overall market .AXJO, as investors weighed the impact of another challenge for a company already facing a showdown at its annual general meeting on Thursday.

It will be volatile for a time. This has got uncertainty written all over it, said Mathan Somasundaram, CEO of investment researcher Deep Data Analytics.

The last high profile company pursued by AUSTRAC, No. 2 lender Westpac Banking Corp WBC.AX, agreed to a A$1.3 billion fine last month over unrelated compliance failures.

Crown was plunged into crisis in 2016 when 16 of its staff were jailed in China for selling casino holidays, violating that countrys gambling ban. Crown quit its overseas interests to focus on the Sydney resort to grow profit.

In the years since, Packer has quit the board of the company he started. At the regulator inquiry this month, he acknowledged demanding frequent trading updates from management, despite having no official role, while negotiating a series of takeover deals which never eventuated, all unbeknownst to shareholders.",1
308,"Malaysiaâs anti-corruption agency has charged the former prime minister Najib Razak with three counts of money laundering as part of its investigation into the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal.

The charges â which Najib denies â relate to three transfers totalling 42m ringgit (US$10m) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB fund that US investigators say was looted of billions by Najibâs associates.

A money laundering offence carries a penalty of a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine of at least fives times the value of the proceeds of any illegal transfers, or 5m ringgit, whichever is the higher.

Najib arrived at the courthouse in a four-car motorcade accompanied by his children. He was dressed in a grey suit and sat in the dock looking calm.

Last month Najib pleaded not guilty to abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust, just two months after the allegation led to his stunning election defeat.

He and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have been barred from leaving the country since he lost an election in May, and the new prime minister, his mentor-turned-foe Mahathir Mohamad, relaunched an investigation into 1MDB.

The 1MDB corruption scandal, described as the biggest in Malaysiaâs history, saw billions of dollars allegedly embezzled and lavishly spent around the globe on luxury property, a private yacht, Hollywood films and extravagant shopping sprees.

Lawsuits filed in US courts by the Department of Justice allege that an estimated $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates. 1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries including Singapore, Switzerland and the US.

Najib has consistently denied the charges, telling local news portal Malaysiakini in June that his trial would be a âtestâ for the Malaysian judiciary. âI believe in my innocence. Therefore the only way I can clear my name is through a system that is fair and a system that is predicated on the rule of law,â he said. âEverybody [should have] a chance to prove themselves under the system.â",1
773,"PANJIM: The State Legislative Assembly of Telangana recently passed an innovative legislation eliminating the need for permissions and approvals of building plans by introducing a new selfcertification system.

The Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS) Bill was passed by the Telangana House unanimously on 14 September, ending decades of cumbersome procedures and corrupt practices including never ending waiting periods for approval of building plans.

Now, residents of Telangana will no longer need any permission from municipal corporations and other urban bodies in urban areas for starting construction activity.

The Bill was passed without any objections. The minister introducing the bill said the TS-bPASS was a self-certification system to make citizens responsible and ensure that they adhere to the building and layout permission rules of the state government.

As per the new law, people constructing a building within 75 square yards land need not obtain any permission from the authorities concerned. However, they must register with the urban local body using TS-bPASS. The citizens can also obtain instant permission for constructions on 75 square yards to 600 square yards through self-certification under TS-bPASS and commence their construction work without the need to pay bribes to get maps and building plans approved. However, for construction in lots of a size bigger than 600 square yards, the authorities concerned will examine the applications seeking permissions and issue necessary permissions within 21 days. In case of shortfall of any documents, the same will be intimated to the applicant within 10 days.

Under the new law, all municipalities are mandated to clear all the building permit applications within the stipulated 21 days failing which the permission is deemed to have been approved.

âFurther, an automated certificate will be issued to the applicant with the signatures of relevant authorities including the municipal commissioner and the town planning officer on behalf of the municipality concerned, to enable them to obtain bank loans or other financial assistance,â the minister said.

The occupancy certificates also will be issued within 15 days upon submitting relevant documents. As a check, the new law empowers authorities to demolish the structure without any prior notice if the construction is unauthorised or illegal in any manner that includes construction on someone elseâs land.",0
273,"As Vladimir Putin returns to office for a fourth term, criticism is bubbling back up over former German chancellor Gerhard Schroederâs close relationship with the Russian president.

A spokesman for current chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday (March 19) had to reject the suggestion that the EU sanction Schroeder for supporting Putin while the German was chancellor, and then taking well-paid jobs by the Russian state after leaving office. Earlier in the day, Ukraineâs foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin had backed a call for sanctions made in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall) during the weekend.

âIt is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putinâs projects abroad,â Klimkin told the German newspaper Bild. âSchroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin worldwide. So it should be examined how the EU can act here.â

The two menâs relationship is so notorious that it has spawned a word used by political analysts and human rights activists in three languages: âSchroederizationâ in English, âSchrÃ¶derisierungâ in German, and âSchroederizatsiaâ (âÐ¨ÑÑÐ´ÐµÑÐ¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñâ) in Russian. In English and Russian, âit means âthe corruption of a political elite in another country,'â said Boris Reitschuster, a German former Moscow correspondent and author of Putinâs Hidden War, at PutinCon, a gathering of the worldâs biggest Kremlin critics on March 16.

In German, the word seems to have extra nuances. While some use it to refer to corruption, one politician from Merkelâs Christian Democrats recently employed it to describe a closeness to the Kremlin. He appealed (link in German) to Schroederâs old Social Democratic Party to not develop uncomfortably close ties to Moscow or help Kremlin propaganda, which he characterized a potential âSchroederization.â

The phrase has been attributed to Edward Lucas, a hawkish former Moscow correspondent for The Economist, but Lucas says former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves coined the word.

Schroeder and Putin go way back, first becoming close as two alpha-male European leaders in the early 2000s. Just before the German was ejected from office after losing his 2005 re-election campaign to Merkel, he gave Putin a parting gift: approval of the Kremlinâs controversial Nord Stream pipeline. The project directed Russian gas into Europe via Germany, upping Moscowâs leverage over the continent. (Russia had previously relied on a route through Ukraine, which was a source of various disputes between the two countries, often leading to Moscow temporarily shutting off the pipeline.) Straight after his election defeat, Schroeder took a well-remunerated job as chairman of the project. After its completion, he became chair of its second iteration, Nord Stream 2, and last year was named chairman of Russiaâs state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Bad bromance?

The two men share more than just a passion for Russian oil and gas expansion, though. Theyâve long enjoyed having a good hug.

Like that time in April 2001.

And September 2001.

And November 2001.

And December 2001.

The AP and Reuters have no documented hugs in 2002. But the news organizations caught Schroeder and Putin finding each other again in October 2003.

And their wives awkwardly watching the two connect again in April 2004.

The two men found a furtive corner in July 2005.

By October 2005, theyâd got that walking side-hug down.

After Schroeder left office in November 2005, the press wasnât around as much to document any potential embraces. But in 2014, just after Putinâs annexation of Crimea, the European Press Association snapped him giving Schroeder a cuddle in St Petersburg on the Germanâs 70th birthday. The German media wasnât impressed.",1
33,"WASHINGTONâJoseph Hirko, former co-chief executive officer of Enron Broadband Services (EBS), Enronâs failed telecommunications business, was sentenced today to 16 months in prison, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.

In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Court Judge Vanessa Gilmore ordered Hirko, 53, of Portland, Ore., to forfeit approximately $7 million in restitution to victims through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionâs Enron Fair Fund, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. Hirko pleaded guilty on Oct. 14, 2008, in U.S. District Court in Houston to one count of wire fraud charged in a superseding indictment.

In July 2005, Hirko and four other EBS executives were tried on various charges of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, insider trading and money laundering relating to their employment at Enron. The trial resulted in a mistrial, and Hirko was subsequently charged in a superseding indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud and insider trading. According to the superseding indictment and the plea agreement, Hirko participated in Enronâs annual analyst conference in Houston at which Enron introduced EBS as one of its âcoreâ units. Enron also announced the development of a broadband operating system or âBOS.â According to the plea agreement, the BOS was purported to be an âintelligentâ operating system and was described as, among other things, a standard protocol for accessing real-time bandwidth.

As alleged in the superseding indictment, Enron issued a press release on May 15, 2000, announcing the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications. According to Hirkoâs guilty plea, the Warpspeed release falsely represented the status of the BOS and implied that it was already embedded and functioning as a part of Enronâs network. Specifically, the Warpspeed release stated that the BOS âallows application developers to dynamically provision bandwidth on demand for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content.â According to the plea agreement, Hirko reviewed and approved this language even though the Warpspeed release contained material inaccurate representations regarding the BOSâs status. In doing so, Hirko admitted that he acted with reckless indifference to the true facts, including: that the BOS was under development throughout his employment at Enron; that it was never embedded on Enronâs network; and that it could not dynamically provide bandwidth on demand or provide for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content. According to the plea agreement, Hirkoâs approval of the Warpspeed release, as well as other press releases, assisted in maintaining Enronâs overall stock price, thereby improperly maintaining the value of Hirkoâs holdings of Enron stock.

This case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Jack B. Patrick, Senior Trial Attorney Jonathan E. Lopez and Trial Attorney Liam B. Brennan of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section.

Charges against the EBS employees were initially brought in March 2003 by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors and agents formed to investigate matters related to the collapse of Enron. All remaining Enron Task Force cases are now being handled by the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, with the investigatory assistance of the FBI.",1
696,"New York (CNN Business)""Shark Tank"" judge Barbara Corcoran is ""thrilled"" about getting back nearly $400,000 after it was stolen in an elaborate email scam.

Corcoran said last week that a phishing scam swindled her out of $388,700. The scammer tricked her bookkeeper into wiring the money by using an email address that was similar to her assistant's, requesting a payment for a renovation.

The millionaire investor said in a statement Monday that she had ""already accepted"" that she had lost the money and ""moved on.""

""I really thought it was a goner,"" she said.

In a twist of good fortune, she said that the German-based bank the bookkeeper used to wire the money froze the transfer before it was deposited into the scammer's bank account in China. Corcoran said her bank asked the German bank to freeze the transaction so her team could prove it was a fraud.

More than 114,000 people reported being a victim of that type of scam last year. Together they reported nearly $60 million in losses, according to the FBI's 2019 Internet Crime Report.

617,"The French trial court on Wednesday found UBS AG and UBS (France) SA guilty of illicit solicitation and laundering the proceeds of tax fraud.

It assessed a penalty of EUR 3.7 billion and EUR 15 million respectively and civil damages of EUR 800 million, or about 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in total.

In response to the ruling, UBS said it strongly disagrees with the verdict.

UBS will appeal the verdict and evaluate whether the written decision requires any additional steps. Under French law, an appeal suspends the judgment of the trial court and leads to a transfer of the case to the Court of Appeals which then retries the case in its entirety, the bank said in a statement.

The development in France comes years after UBS agreed to pay US authorities $780 million over tax evasion issues, as part of a 2009 deferred prosecution agreement under which it also agreed to provide the US government with the identities of certain United States customers of UBSs cross-border business.",1
400,"A fund in which the Vaticans Secretariat of State has invested tens of millions of euros has links to two Swiss banks investigated or implicated in bribery and money laundering scandals involving more than one billion dollars. The fund is under investigation by Vatican authorities.

The fund, Centurion Global Fund, made headlines this week that it used the Vatican assets under its management to invest in Hollywood films, real estate, and utilities, including investments in movies like Men in Black International and the Elton John biopic Rocketman.

Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported that the Centurion Global Fund has raised around 70 million euro in cash, and that the Holy Sees Secretariat of State is the source of at least two-thirds of the funds assets. The Vaticans investment is reported to include funds from the Peters Pence collection, intended to support charitable works and the ministry of the Vatican Curia.

Centurion registered a loss of some 4.6% in 2018, while at the same time incurring management fees of roughly 2 million euros, raising questions about the prudential use of Vatican resources.

But beyond losses, a CNA investigation has found that Centurion Global Fund is connected to several institutions linked to allegations of money laundering.

Fund prospectus documents state that all Centurion investment funds are held by Lugano-based Banca Zarattini, a small Swiss bank providing private banking, asset management, and fixed income trading services.

Swiss and U.S. media outlets in 2018 reported that Zarattini was named in indictments filed by U.S. prosecutors in a $1 billion money laundering case, involving the Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA and Venezuelas president Nicholas Maduro.

Along with an offshore bank and a New Jersey institution that has faced several investigations for non-compliance with money laundering regulations, Zarrattini was at the time holding funds subject to seizure in the PDVSA money laundering investigation.

Swiss financial news sites also linked the bank to an alleged $62 million bribe paid to a PDVSA official.

Centurion Global Fund shares a corporate office, 259 St. Paul Street in Valetta, Malta, and a single phone number and email address, with a Malta-based investment group, Gamma Capital which is listed as Centurions formal investment manager.

Gamma Capitals founder and owner is Enzo Filippini. Before founding Gamma, Filippini served as head of the treasury department for a now-closed Swiss bank, BSI.

In 2016, Swiss banking authorities effectively shuttered BSI by a forced extinctive merger, after concluding that it had committed serious breaches of the statutory due diligence requirements in relation to money laundering and serious violations of the principles of adequate risk management and appropriate organization.

European brokerage firms like Gamma Capital Trader are required to disclose the institutions through which they execute client trades each year. In 2017, Gamma executed all of its trades through a single bank  Banca Zarattini.

The next year, 2018, Gamma used only two institutions to execute client trades, Zarattini and Sparkasse Bank Malta, which was also involved in the PDVSA money laundering scandal, according to multiple media reports.

The Times of Malta reported that Sparkasse Bank was mentioned in the Panama Papers data leak as the Maltese institution of choice for infamous money-laundering Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

The CEO of Gamma Capital Markets is Alexander Vella. Vella is also the sole listed director at E2S Monitoring, a compliance firm which also lists its address as 259 St. Paul Street. E2S is the company that registered Centurion Global Fund with Maltese regulators in 2016.",1
25,"CHICAGO (CBS) â Knowing he would soon be sentenced for a brazen $23 million scam involving scores of phony pieces of sports memorabilia, an Arkansas con man looked at his oldest son in court and said, âI screwed it up.â

Pausing and tapping his fingers on a table, John Rogers explained that he cut a deal with the feds that led him to wear a wire against dangerous people â even killers â because he hoped it would help him get out of prison in time for the high school juniorâs last year of college.

Then the feds caught him selling fake merchandise all over again this fall, putting an end to any such hope. U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin called the move âmonumentally stupidâ on Wednesday, moments before he hammered Rogers with a 12-year sentence for a fraud of âbreathtakingâ proportions.

He did so after Rogers also admitted, âI didnât think of my son when I was doing these things.â

When the hearing ended, Rogers gave a thumbs-up to the boy, who quickly left the courtroom where he had earlier called his father his âhero.â

First charged in September 2016 for a scheme to use a fake Billy Sims Heisman Trophy as collateral for a $100,000 loan, prosecutors say Rogers was more recently involved in a ânew waveâ of fraud that involved a phony Super Bowl I game ball and even âa fake Mickey Mantle silverware set.â

Rogers, 44, wound up in federal jail here after a hearing on the matter last month.

Rogers said he set out to create âfantasy itemsâ â replicas â that would never fool the public. But he said he fell back into his old ways. He and his attorney, J. Blake Hendrix, also said Rogers has long battled a drug addiction. Rogers tested positive for cocaine in October, according to Hendrix, and Rogers said he brought cocaine along when he traveled to Chicago for last monthâs hearing.

âI know my words are shallow and may not be believed,â Rogers said.

Rogers pleaded guilty to wire fraud last March. He made the fake Sims Heisman using an honorary Heisman given to announcer Al Helfer in 1960. He swapped out the trophyâs nameplate but ignored a dent on the left side of its base, as well as scratches and other marks. He also failed to replace a missing screw.

The feds say Rogers had at least 26 victims, stealing $23 million that he must now pay back in restitution. He said more fake merchandise remains on the market.

Rogersâ case followed a yearslong FBI investigation into sports memorabilia auction houses such as Mastro Auctions in the western suburbs. Rogers secretly recorded Doug Allen, the former president of Mastro Auctions, who was sentenced to 57 months in prison last year. Hendrix also said Rogers wore a wire on other âvery bad people.â

Meanwhile, Rogers said he realized he had put himself in a position where he could no longer be a proper father to his children.

But Durkin told Rogers, âI canât care more about your children than you did.â",1

230,"MIAMI (Reuters) - The brother of jailed Colombian drug kingpin Diego Montoya, head of the Norte del Valle cartel, pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and obstruction of justice, U.S. prosecutors said.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the cartel and had primary responsibility for managing its finances, according to U.S. authorities.

He was arrested by Colombian authorities in January 2007 following a shootout and extradited to Florida last June.

U.S. prosecutors said the cartel often kept up to $20 million in cash from drug sales in stash houses maintained and overseen by Montoya Sanchez.

As the cartelâs money manager, he used drug proceeds to fund cocaine labs, pay employees including lab workers, drug couriers and security personnel, and invest in real estate and other businesses. In 2003, his role expanded to coordinating cocaine shipments, they said.

Diego Montoya, known as Don Diego or the Boss of Bosses, in Colombiaâs underworld, was extradited to Florida last month and is awaiting trial. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBIâs âTen Most Wantedâ list.

Sentencing for Eugenio Montoya Sanchez in Miami was scheduled for April 3.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.",1
721,"Organised crime groups based in the UK reportedly generate more money (over Â£24 million) from selling illegal drugs on the dark web than in any other country in the world.

Knowing this helps us understand how organised crime groups are using the internet to modernise and make money. But it doesnât help us understand what these groups really look like, in terms of their internal organisation, recruitment and general âbusinessâ activity.

In fact, my current research into organised crime in the UK and Europe reveals big gaps in our knowledge. Law enforcement agencies, policymakers and academics have failed to join the dots (or even agree on what those dots are) and achieve a full understanding of organised crime.

Take, for example, the human trafficking network that organised the UK-bound lorry journey that led to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese nationals in 2019. Some arrests have been made, but do we really understand how the groups responsible cooperated to facilitate entry into the UK?

Or consider how the approach to âmodern slaveryâ centres on the condition of the victims (which should not be ignored), but not the organisations which create it.

We know that most of the victims in the UK are minors, often forced to transport and sell drugs on the streets. But who are the people controlling the victims who suffer domestic servitude, forced labour and sexual exploitation? Who operates the brothels and cannabis factories, the car washes and restaurants where modern slavery is put into practice?

Perhaps we need to use another approach â one that is less centred around the moment a crime is committed, and takes a wider view of the membership and organisational structures of the groups behind those crimes.

The Italian way

Some are critical of the Italian law known as âmafia associationâ, which focuses on the criminal network and its membership as being a crime in itself. They believe its implementation risks sending innocent people to prison, while others think the law is specific to the Italian context and its history.

But Italian police officials could easily argue that, to a certain extent, their approach is working. In January 2020, the Italian Guardia Di Finanza in Reggio Calabria arrested, among others, a bank manager and a doctor on suspicion of being members of a mafia association, the âNdrangheta.

They were not the âusual suspectsâ for a mafia. Yet the policeâs joined-up approach of looking at all aspects of human behaviour and criminal activities (monitoring meetings, telephone conversations, financial transactions) locally and nationally was able to reveal the extensive power of the criminal network. This investigation highlights how Italian police have the instruments to be able to see the whole network â in particular the side that is hidden within the legal economy, local politics and society.

Again in January 2020, 94 people were arrested on suspicion of having defrauded EU agricultural subsidies. The suspects varied from traditional foot soldiers of the Sicilian mafia to representatives of the local economy and politics. They included a local mayor and an accountant.

This broad and complex approach allows police officers and judges to work in a practical, concrete and cohesive way by looking at the association of the people as a crime. It is the association that seeks to do the harm.

The focus then moves on to the specific wrong doing as a product of a whole group activity â not just the individuals at the lower levels of the chain who do the âdirty workâ, like selling drugs on the street. Itâs about moving up the chain to intercept the broader supply and importation networks. By looking at the group dynamics, it becomes easier to understand motives and logistics than it is by simply concentrating on standalone crimes.

It is a method which encourages a wider and more informative overview of organised crime. It also acknowledges the intricate nature of how this kind of crime is based both on control of criminal activities and on a âmoney cycleâ.

This is the way organised crime groups seek to simultaneously make money on the streets from illegal activities (drugs, fake goods) and then transfer their profits to the legal economy (businesses, real estate, genuine luxury goods). In other words, following the money becomes central to targeting organised crime groups â and protecting their victims.",0
537,"PORTLAND, Ore.Two former Jacksonville, Oregon residents were sentenced today in federal court for their roles in a conspiracy to traffic marijuana grown in Southern Oregon to Georgia, Illinois, and North Carolina, and launder the proceeds.

Alex David Koplin, 34, was sentenced to 31 months in federal prison and three years supervised release and Tina Marie Waterfield, 38, was sentenced to 5 years of probation.

According to court documents, in approximately 2011, Koplin moved from Georgia to Oregon to work in the marijuana industry. Within a few years, he purchased property in Jackson County, Oregon and started a marijuana farm. Koplin worked with other marijuana growers to combine harvests, broker sales, and transport marijuana from Oregon to other states. Between November 2014 and June 2016, Koplin coordinated the sale and interstate transport of approximately 260 kilograms of marijuana.

While investigating the interstate trafficking conspiracy, authorities discovered Waterfield, Koplins then-girlfriend, was receiving thousands of dollars in out-of-state payments to her PayPal account. Investigators later learned that Waterfield unlawfully manufactured, sold, and shipped marijuana edibles to East Coast customers and laundered the proceeds in an attempt to conceal their source. Between 2013 and 2016, Waterfields bank accounts showed approximately $494,000 in unexplained deposits.

In April 2017, investigators executed a federal search warrant on Koplin and Waterfields residence and seized marijuana plants; unprocessed cut marijuana; butane honey oil, a cannabis extract; and $44,226 in U.S. currency.

On August 19, 2019, both defendants pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Koplin also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.

As part of his plea agreement, Koplin agreed to pay $150,000 to satisfy a forfeiture money judgment. Waterfield agreed to forfeit the $44,226 in U.S. currency seized from the residence she shared with Koplin.

This case was investigated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and Medford Police Department. It was prosecuted by Steven T. Mygrant and Julia E. Jarrett, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.

This case was brought as part of the Justice Departments Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, the centerpiece of the departments strategy for reducing the availability of drugs in the U.S. OCDETF was established in 1982 to mount a comprehensive attack on drug trafficking by disrupting and dismantling major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. Today, OCDETF combines the resources and expertise of its member federal agencies in coordination with state and local law enforcement.",1
632,"(Reuters) - The FBI said on Wednesday it had evidence linking a deceased, self-described anti-feminist lawyer suspected of killing the son of New Jersey federal judge Esther Salas to a murder earlier this month in California.

The FBI, in an emailed statement, said it was working with the sheriffs office in San Bernardino, California, and had evidence tying the lawyer, Roy Den Hollander, to the July 11 killing of Marc Angelucci, a former associate of Hollander in the mens rights movement.

Hollander, who was found dead on Monday in an apparent suicide, was the sole suspect in the Sunday attack at Salas home. The attack killed the 20-year-old son of Salas, a judge on the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, and wounded her husband.

The FBI says it now believes Hollander was involved in the death of Angelucci, who was vice president of the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). Angelucci was found July 11 with apparent gunshot wounds in Cedarpines Park, California, which is about 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

NCFM President Harry Crouch told Reuters that Hollander and Angelucci had had a falling out several years ago around the time Hollander was dismissed from the organization.",0
989,"There has been a discernible shift in President Cyril Ramaphosas communications strategy. He replaced his spokesperson Khusela Diko in July after it emerged that her husband had his snout in the bountiful PPE feeding trough.

Ever since her acting replacement Tyrone Seale started signing off on statements, there has been a strong drive to get the message across that concrete steps are being taken against corruption. Seale is a former journalist whose byline was prominent in Cape newspapers before he crossed over to the public relations sector.

In addition to regular updates on arrests, and repeated messages that corruption will no longer be tolerated, a score-board has appeared on the government news website, underscoring that a serious campaign is underway. The current figures, alongside an anti-corruption hotline, show that there were 80 arrests, four convictions and about R230m in assets seized in the first two weeks of October.

Law enforcers have some powerful figures in their sights. Read this piece by my BizNews colleague Bernice Maune:

403,"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the New York State Department of Financial Services has filed charges and initiated administrative proceedings against Endo International plc and its subsidiaries, Endo Health Solutions Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. These charges are the second to be filed in DFS' ongoing investigation into the entities that created and perpetuated the opioid crisis.

""All these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were, and they used it as a reckless business model for their own financial gain at the cost of thousands of human lives and billions of dollars. New York demands accountability from the drug companies and others responsible for the opioid epidemic that continues to devastate families and communities throughout the state and across the country,"" Governor Cuomo said.""Their greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable, and New York will make sure that justice is served and these big pharmaceutical companies are ultimately held responsible for their actions.""

According to DFS' Statement of Charges, Endo has been a prolific manufacturer of opioids in the United States, manufacturing approximately 18.4 percent of the opioids that flooded New York from 2006 to 2014. Endo manufactured both its own branded opioids as well as generic opioids.

The DFS' Statement of Charges alleges that, like other opioid manufacturers, Endo:

Knowingly furthered a false narrative to legitimize opioids as appropriate for broad treatment of pain by downplaying their long-known addictive nature and risks. This strategic effort caused a shift in medical providers' and patients' acceptance of opioids as medically legitimate, necessary and appropriate painkillers. As a result, demand soared, as did the predictable negative consequences;
Misrepresented the safety and efficacy of opioids, without legitimate scientific substantiation, in a panoply of materials typically used by the medical community and patients, including marketing and promotional materials, educational publications, and medical literature published by associations and key opinion leaders funded and supported by Endo; and
Deployed a large sales force to target healthcare providers directly with these misrepresentations. Indeed, Endo's representatives made at least 165,000 sales calls just in New York to market its branded opioid, Opana ER, over just a four-year period.

DFS has further alleged that Endo repeatedly marketed a reformulated version of Opana as abuse-resistant without having a legitimate basis for such a claim. The Federal Food and Drug Administration had rejected Endo's request to use such language on product labelling on the ground that ""the data did not show that the reformulation could be expected to meaningfully reduce abuse,"" and Endo's own internal documents showed that the new product remained subject to abuse. Despite that, Endo continued to market the new formulation as safer and less likely to be abused than its older product and comparable generics. In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo remove Reformulated Opana ER from the market due to its high risk of abuse.

According to DFS' Statement of Charges, Endo violated two New York Insurance Laws. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law prohibits fraudulent insurance acts and carries with it penalties of up to $5,000 plus the amount of the fraudulent claim for each violation; DFS alleges that each fraudulent prescription constitutes a separate violation. Section 408 of the Financial Services Law prohibits intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to a financial product or service, which includes health insurance and carries with it penalties of up to $5,000 per violation; once again, DFS alleges that each fraudulent prescription constitutes a separate violation.

The hearing will be held at the office of the New York State Department of Financial Services, One State Street, New York, New York, beginning on October 26, 2020.",1
823,"China plans to ramp up its crackdown on heathcare scams as fraudulent practices are still severe and prevalent in the country's medical insurance sector, Hu Jinglin, head of the National Healthcare Security Administration, said on Sunday afternoon on the sidelines of the second session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The country's top medical security authority launched a nationwide campaign in September to discover issues and combat violations associated with healthcare insurance funds.

""The campaign has recovered a great deal of medical insurance money,"" he told reporters at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. ""About 66,000 medical institutions in breach of regulations have been identified, and 24,000 individuals were found to have committed frauds.""

However, Hu said the overall supervision and management of China's healthcare fund is still lax and loose.

""There is still an arduous task ahead in order to root out healthcare scams, and this task will be a top priority for us,"" he said.

A host of measures will be rolled out, according to Hu, including increasing the number of random examinations and sample collections to make full use of the reward system for whistleblowers, and deploying information technologies, especially big data to help identify violators.",0
488,"Greenbelt, Maryland  A federal jury in Maryland yesterday convicted Nigerian national Seun Banjo Ojedokun, age 37, for a money laundering conspiracy related to a romance scam and other fraud schemes.

The conviction was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur and Special Agent in Charge Jennifer C. Boone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.

U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur stated, This defendant was part of a conspiracy that stole from many vulnerable and elderly victims across the United States, defrauding them through lies and laundering the funds internationally. The deceit used to steal from these victims was heartless, considering how vulnerable and financially devastated they were. Ojedokun was in Nigeria when he was committing these crimes. Law enforcement was able to arrest him when he came to the United States to attend school here. The U.S. Attorneys Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing to justice fraudsters who prey upon the elderly. We will continue our outreach efforts to make the public aware of scams and frauds targeting elderly victims and encourage anyone who believes they may be a victim to contact the newly launched Elder Fraud Hotline at 833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311).

These targeted scams are all to prevalent and the FBI, along with our law enforcement partners, are diligently working to alert and protect the public from falling victim, said Jennifer C. Boone, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. The arrest and conviction of Mr. Ojedokun, who was operating in Nigeria during the conspiracy, demonstrates the lengths that the FBI will go in order to hold accountable the people who commit these heinous crimes.

According to the evidence presented at his six-day trial, between 2013 and March 2015, Ojedokun conspired with Gbenga Benson Ogundele, Mukhtar Danjuma Haruna, a/k/a Mukky, and others to use money deposited into bank accounts by fraud victims to engage in financial transactions in order to promote the fraud scheme and conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the fraud proceeds.

According to evidence presented at trial, members of the conspiracy searched online dating websites to initiate romantic relationships with vulnerable men and women. They phoned, e-mailed, texted and used Internet chat messenger services to form romantic relationships with the victims, who lived throughout the United States.

Specifically, witnesses testified that members of the conspiracy used false stories and promises to convince the many victims to provide money to the conspirators, including fake hospital bills, plane trips to visit the victims, problems with overseas businesses, and foreign taxes. Ogundele and other conspirators opened bank accounts, called drop accounts, in order to receive millions of dollars from the victims. Testimony at trial showed that victims provided money to the conspirators as a result of the false stories and promises, either depositing money directly into drop accounts controlled by the conspirators, or by checks sent to the conspirators. The loss to the eight victims who testified at trial was well over $1 million and the overall total loss was substantially higher.

In addition, the evidence at trial showed that the conspirators engaged in other types of fraud, including a fraudulent employment scam in which the victim was led to believe she had been hired by a company, and was instructed to deposit the proceeds of a fraudulent check into a drop account controlled by the conspirators.

According to the evidence, Ojedokun, Ogundele, Haruna, and their co-conspirators laundered money received from the fraud victims by buying used cars and shipping them to Nigeria, among other methods. As part of the fraud schemes, Ojedokun and his co-conspirators transmitted and used images of financial transactions, including bank deposit receipts and wire transfer forms, as proof that a deposit of fraud money had been made by a victim.

Ogundele, age 61, formerly of Laurel, Maryland, was convicted in 2016 after a 17-day trial, of conspiracies to commit money laundering and wire fraud, as well as aggravated identity theft, and was sentenced to 234 months in federal prison. Haruna, age 46, of Nigeria, remains a fugitive and charges against him are still pending. In addition to Ogundele, eight other defendants were convicted for their roles in the fraud scheme and were sentenced to between a year and a day and 234 months in federal prison.

Ojedokun faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. U.S. District Judge Paul W. Grimm has scheduled sentencing for January 20, 2021 at 10:00 a.m.

United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FBI for its work in the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Windom and U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur represented the United States at trial.

990,"Ohio resident Bill Bickham got in touch with Cocoa Beach police after he learned that big money was being siphoned from his older brothers bank account and credit card by an employee of the older man.

But when Bickhams sibling, a Cocoa Beach resident, died at age 87 in 2012, the case against the alleged perpetrator died along with him.

Financial exploitation directed at older Americans is so pervasive and increasing so quickly, its estimated that 20 percent of older adults have been a victim.

Theyre ripped off by relatives. Caregivers. Investment advisers and trusted friends. Often, theyre victimized by those with power of attorney. Credit and debit cards are misused; pension or benefit checks are stolen; and checks are written without authorization. And, in most cases, experts say, the money is not recovered.

Preventing exploitation

Tuesday, the American Bar Association, the nonprofit Investor Protection Trust and the nonprofit Investor Protection Institute announced a push to help curb such abuse, starting with a program to train attorneys to see exploitation and address it among clients.

The Elder Investment Fraud and Financial Exploitation Prevention Program Legal will be designed to teach lawyers to recognize clients possible vulnerability because of mild cognitive impairment; identify such fraud in their clients; and report suspected instances to appropriate authorities.

Because lawyers play such a significant role in advising and serving an aging society, especially around financial matters, their role in spotting, preventing and responding to financial exploitation needs to be as professional and effective as possible, said Charles Sabatino, director of the American Bar Associations Commission on Law and Aging.

Yet, it is not an area in which many are effectively trained, he said.

Anything that helps target abuse against older adults is welcomed by the Brevard State Attorneys Office, said Laura Moody, assistant state attorney.

Knowing the red flags is so critical, because what we find are numerous exploitation cases where the perpetrator is someone acting with legal authority, Moody said.

We dont see a lot of guardian cases, but we see a tremendous number of power of attorney abuse cases. Theyll get that legal authority through a lawyers office and deplete all the principals funds. We see trustee cases as well.

The ABA and IPT recently conducted a survey of more than 650 practicing attorneys nationwide in which they explored awareness of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

Among key findings:

 More than 9 out of 10 attorneys say elder investment fraud and financial exploitation is a very serious or somewhat serious problem.

 More than 1 in 3 attorneys says they are aware they are or may be dealing with the victims of elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

 Roughly 9 out of 10 attorneys would be willing to participate in a continuing legal education program about detecting, preventing, and redressing elder investment fraud and financial exploitation.

Its such a critical issue, that attorneys know their clients well; know their patterns and habits, Moody said.

In the past, weve asked a few of our civil lawyers to start putting warnings on documents like power of attorney documents. That gives a warning to the person that they know what their fiduciary obligations are, and they dont have an excuse later, like I thought I could do anything I wanted to do with this money. 

In the case of the Cocoa Beach man, a widower, the alleged perpetrator used her employers checks and credit card to make purchases mounting into thousands of dollars monthly.

Not until Bill Bickham learned of the abuse of his brothers finances did the pieces start to come together  but at least $100,000 was gone.

And though Moodys office and local law enforcement tried their best, she said, the victim refused to cooperate with prosecution of the alleged perpetrator. His death made it almost impossible to proceed, she said.

Its very important that people know whats going on with their family and that attorneys know about their clients, too, said Bickham, 76.

But my brother didnt have any children. And Im just his brother, and live out of state. He wasnt the type to go out and play golf or go to McDonalds and drink coffee with friends, so there was really no one out there noticing these things.

The case could possibly have been prosecuted succesfully, Moody said, under enhanced exploitation laws that go into effect in Florida this October.

Changes include a revised definition of exploitation of an elderly person or disabled adult (vulnerable adult). Penalties are enhanced for stealing personal ID information of anyone 60 or older, and theres a decrease in the property threshold values for exploitation of vulnerable adults offenses.

Along with family and medical professionals noting changes in behavior, its crucial for attorneys to see warning signs in their clients behavior, both physical and financial  no matter who has power over their finances, said Moody.

They represent the elder in these cases, she said. They dont represent the person who assumes that power.

Israeli top model Bar Refaeli has been given a large fine and sentenced to nine months of community service for evading taxes.

The 35-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of providing false tax returns while living abroad in order to avoid Israeli taxes.

The court in Tel Aviv ordered her to pay a 2.5m-shekel fine (Â£577,000; $730,000), in addition to arrears.

The model's mother was also convicted of tax offences.

Tzipi Refaeli, who also acted as her daughter's agent, was sentenced to 16 months in prison and also ordered to pay a 2.5m-shekel penalty and taxes owed.

The two women pleaded guilty and were sentenced under a deal agreed with authorities last month.

Israeli authorities began their investigation into the case in 2015.

Bar Refaeli admitted to not declaring her worldwide income for certain years, claiming that she spent most of the time abroad, although her lawyers said she had not intentionally avoided the tax payments.

Her mother, meanwhile, was convicted of signing property leases under the names of relatives to obscure the model's residency status, among other charges.

The model, who previously dated US actor Leonardo DiCaprio and hosted the 2019 Eurovision song contest, has been involved in controversy during her career.

She has faced anger from the Israeli army for not completing military service and in 2018 .

In 2015, her request to close the air space over her wedding venue sparked a row.",1
81,"Mexicoâs Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero announced Tuesday that prosecutors were opening a corruption investigation against former president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who was in office from 2012 to 2018. This announcement follows accusations made against PeÃ±a Nieto by the former head of the oil company PetrÃ³leos Mexicanos (Pemex).

Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Pemex, was extradited from Spain in July to stand trial on corruption charges. He was accused of taking $10 million in bribes from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.

Lozoya accused PeÃ±a Nieto and PeÃ±a Nietoâs former finance minister of instructing Lozoya to give bribes of more than 100 million pesos to finance PeÃ±a Nietoâs 2012 presidential campaign. This money was allegedly given to electoral advisors abroad. Lozoya also alleged that PeÃ±a Nieto similarly used bribes to buy votes while he was in office, bribing one deputy and five senators for their votes on reforms in 2013 and 2014.

On opening the investigation, Manero said:

From this moment on, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has opened the corresponding investigation file and we will begin to carry out all the procedures. First the ratifications, then the presentation of witnesses, the expert analysis of each one of the receipts, and the video. And when the time comes, we will call the people he [Lozoya] imputes to testify.",1
653,"Tougher laws to make bribery and corruption a corporate offence. Oman is to introduce tougher powers to clamp down on bribery and corruption after it signed up to the UN Convention against Corruption, a legal expert has said.

The Sultanate has seen a number of high-profile corruption trials in recent years â including one which saw the founder of the countryâs biggest publicly-listed construction company, Galfar, sentenced to three years in jail - a decision he has appealed.

Jamie Kellick of international law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, said one major effect of the new legislation will be to make corruption and bribery in the workplace a corporate offence. Under current legislation it is only a personal offence.

Kellick said that for companies to minimise risk of falling foul of the new legislation they need to ensure that they are complying with the following categories: proportionate procedures; top-level commitment; risk assessment; due diligence; communication and training; monitoring and review; and reporting.

âIt must be led from the management. The recent corruption cases of last year and this year, itâs all very well if a company turns around and says we had a rogue officer itâs got nothing to with the company, itâs just a very unfortunate incident that heâs run off with a whole load of money,â  he said at the CW Leaders in Construction Oman in Muscat.

âNow that Oman has signed up to the UN Convention, one thing that I can be very sure is that the legislation is going to change. Itâs going to become as it is in the States and Europe; itâs going to become a corporate offence. So there is going to be no excuse for companies for not at least attempting to have some procedures in place.â

Kellick said that one of the measures companies can take is to ensure their contracts with subcontractors, suppliers and third parties contain a âright to auditâ clause.

âThis is actually a big issue because it gives you that ability to undertake that due diligence on the suppliers that you have,â he said. âIf a supplier turns around and takes massive umbrage that you have asked for the right to audit then theyâre not the supplier for you.

âYou want to do that trickle down affect,â he added. âYou want to see in their contract that they have the right to audit the subcontractor below them.â

Kellick said that firms would have to demonstrate that they are activity putting procedures in place to curb bribery and corruption.

âNot only do you have to put in the procedures and practices, you actually have to enforce them through training and actually informing your employees and your suppliers and your third parties that this is now the norm and not the exception,â he said.

652,"The Juncker Commission has made the fight against tax avoidance, money laundering and terrorism financing one of its priorities.

Today, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive enters into force. It strengthens the existing rules and will make the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing more effective. It also improves transparency to prevent tax avoidance. This entry into force comes as discussions with the European Parliament and the Council on extra measures further reinforcing the Directive are already at an advanced stage.

Today the Commission also publishes a report which will support Member State authorities in better addressing money laundering risks in practice. As required by the new directive, the Commission assessed the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of different sectors and financial products. The report published today identifies the areas most at risk and the most widespread techniques used by criminals to launder illicit funds.

Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President said: ""Laundered money is oxygen to crime, terrorism and tax-avoidance. We need to cut off its supply as best we can. Today's stronger rules are a big step forward but we now need quick agreement on the further improvements the Commission proposed last July.""

VÄra JourovÃ¡, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality said: âTerrorists and criminals still find ways to finance their activities and to launder illicit gains back into the economy. The new rules as of today are crucial to closing further loopholes. I urge all Member States to put them in place without delay: lower standards in one country will weaken the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing across the EU. I also call for quick agreement on the further revisions proposed by the Commission following the ""Panama Papers"" to increase transparency of beneficial ownership.""

Strengthening the existing rules

The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering  reinforces the existing rules by introducing the following changes:

reinforcing the risk assessment obligation for banks, lawyers, and accountants;
setting clear transparency requirements about beneficial ownership for companies. This information will be stored in a central register, such as commercial registers, and will be available to national authorities and obliged entities
facilitating cooperation and exchange of information between Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money to prevent and detect crime or terrorist activities;
establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules;
reinforcing the sanctioning powers of competent authorities.
In July 2016, the Commission adopted a proposal to further reinforce these EU rules on anti-money laundering to counter terrorist financing and increase transparency about who really owns companies and trusts. The Commission calls on the European Parliament and the Council to finalise this legislative work as soon as possible, so the new rules can enter into force quickly. Building on the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, these new rules will create a robust EU anti-money laundering framework.

Improving the risk assessment across the internal market

The Supranational Risk Assessment Reportis a tool to help Member States identify, analyse and address money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It analyses the risks in the financial and non-financial sector and looks also into newly emerging risks such as virtual currencies or crowdfunding platforms. The report includes:  

an extensive mapping of risks per relevant area and a list of the means more frequently used by criminals to launder money.
recommendations to Member States how to address identified risks appropriately, for example by putting more emphasis on risk analysis or supervisory actions on specific activities.
Finally the Commission also commits to examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units.

Next steps

On the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive

The Member States should have notified the transposition of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive by today, 26 June 2017. The European Commission will now check the state of the transposition and follow up swiftly with Member States in case they have not taken the necessary measures yet.

On the Supranational Risk Assessment Report

The Commission will carry out the necessary actions outlined in the report, including examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units through specific EU rules. It will also engage with Member States to monitor the implementation of the recommendations.

The Commission will continue reviewing the evolution of Anti-Money Laundry/Counter Financing Terrorism risks and will issue a new assessment of those risks at the latest by June 2019 and every two years thereafter.

Background

The new anti-money laundering framework consists of two legal instruments (IP/15/5001): âThe Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive' and âthe Fund Transfers Regulation', both adopted on 20 May 2015.

In July 2016, the Commission presented a proposal to better counter the financing of terrorism and to ensure increased transparency of financial transactions following the so-called ""Panama Papers"" revelations (IP/16/2380). These amendments aim at ensuring a high level of safeguards for financial flows from high-risk third countries, enhancing the access of Financial Intelligence Units to information, including centralised bank account registers, and tackling terrorist financing risks linked to virtual currencies and pre-paid cards. The proposal is currently in negotiations in the Council and the European Parliament and is expected to be adopted in the course of 2017.",0
681,"PETALING JAYA: More than 50% of financial institutions (FIs) in Malaysia see identity verification (58%) and cyber fraud prevention (50%) as key challenges in driving digital transaction growth, according to GBG, a specialist in fraud, identity verification and location data intelligence.

It was reported that Malaysia experienced RM153 million of losses as a result of cybercrimes in the first five months of 2019.

About 47% of FIs in Malaysia indicated fraud detection while digitally onboarding new customers as the biggest challenge, which is higher than the Asia Pacific (Apac) aggregate of 37%, as revealed in GBGâs inaugural report in Malaysia, âFuture-proofing Fraud Prevention in Digital Channels: Malaysia FI Studyâ.

GBG Apac managing director June Lee (pix) said this was due to the high penetration of mobile utilisation in the country and Covid-19 has increased the number even further as consumers are driven to perform financial transactions now.

The second biggest challenge indicated was identity verification of new customers for account opening (33%).

âThink about how we get through our day. The massive amount of personal data that we leave in the trail, from accessing our social media account, posting a video online, getting on the e-commerce platform to buy groceries, collecting and uploading data to the cloud from wearables like Fitbitâ¦ all these activities make cyberfraud easier to administer. FIs are even more vulnerable to these cyber activities,â she said in a virtual media briefing today.

The ability of Malaysian FIs to manage fraud in the entire digital customer journey is, however, not yet on par with the progressive pace of digitalisation.

âIn most cases, the digitalisation of the product move at a much faster rate than the adoption of technology to protect and defend against cyber fraud. The Covid-19 pandemic also helped to escalate the volume of cyberfraud attacks with our increased online dependency,â added Lee, who is based in Singapore.

This gap will be intensified as over 25% of Malaysian FIs plan to ramp up their rollout of instant banking and credit facilities, particularly instant bank account application, instant loan and instant credit card application. Instant financial services are of huge interest to consumers, providing them immediate gratification in obtaining financial support and merchandise, but fraud detection and prevention for these services are still in the nascent stage and both organisation and consumers could be more vulnerable to unchartered fraud types.

For FIs in Malaysia, digital banking and cashless services have gone mainstream and are pegged to overtake the average Apac rate of adoption this year, in particularly e-banking, e-statements, and e-wallet services. The indicators reflecting Malaysiaâs growing digital lifestyle preference can be seen from their relatively high smartphone penetration at 78%, and the readiness in its internet infrastructure from the 80% penetration rate of their 4G networks.

From the research, all fraud typologies from social engineering, first party fraud, cyber attacks and anti-money laundering are projected to rise in 2020-2021. In particular, 54% of the FIs in Malaysia are expecting an increase in scams and 51% on stolen IDs.

âLooking at 2020-2021, the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to push people and businesses to take digital-first approaches to financial transactions. Our research indicates that 21% of FIs in Malaysia have started to lay the groundwork in establishing end-to-end fraud management platforms. However, the expected growth in scams would require added layers of data intelligence to assess the digital tools which are used to onboard and transact with the financial organisations, as well as to obtain a better holistic view of the intent and integrity of the individuals.

Meanwhile, Lee pointed out that at least 60% of the FIs in Malaysia have approved budget to invest in cyber fraud solutions this year, but noted that only about 20% of FIs are currently equipped.

When comparing Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, Lee said Malaysia has done well and is advanced in terms of having a Risk Management in Technology policy and a fraud bureau that allows banks to share information of fraudsters.

âFraud mitigation is not just about technology, itâs also the people, processes and policies. You can have the best technology, but human can be your weakest link. Banks need to look at all the different areas. All these, coupled with implementing some of the latest technology, can help to mitigate wide-ranging fraud. In addition, we encourage FIs to come together to have a regular sharing session on the trends they see in the market.â

GBG worked with The Asian Banker to conduct the survey across 324 respondents from FIs in six Apac countries, including Malaysia.",0
870,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has a ""red flag"" feature, which serves up a ""ping"" whenever an individual or business has been suspected of having fraudulent activity conducted against their name or if their account has been compromised.

Facing Senate Estimates on Tuesday, ATO client engagement second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn explained that this ping was effectively a caveat on taxpayers' affairs.

While Hirschhorn said there was no increase in fraudulent activity that could be directly tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said his teams have been very focused on fraud this year.

""Obviously there are new mechanisms of potential fraud across all the programs. We have found -- I have previously testified to the level of fraud in the ERS program, which is at about 0.3% of applications on our country, which is a very, very low level of fraud. We have also been looking at JobKeeper and Cashflow Boost and have not found systemic fraud,"" he said.

See also: ATO wants to verify citizens are alive and physically present for myGovID registrations

""We have found that there have been some individual opportunistic frauds but we have not identified a high level of fraud and part of that was the design feature of the measures which were designed to be available only to those who have a good lodgement and tax history, which made it harder for people to resurrect dormant entities.""

On the reports of fraud related to the federal government's early access super scheme, Hirschhorn said the ATO has received a variety of suspicious matter reports from Austrac. But he also said there has been an increase of data breach-related fraud.

""There has also been a spate of -- you know, when an organisation has its payroll data, amongst other data hacked, there have been a few hackings of companies which have meant that we have put more red flags on identity files,"" he said.

In Australia, the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme requires agencies and organisations that are covered by the Privacy Act to notify individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in ""serious harm"", as soon as practicable after becoming aware of a breach.

In general terms, an eligible data breach refers to the unauthorised access, loss, or disclosure of personal information that could cause serious harm to the individual whose personal information has been compromised.

In its last report, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner revealed the total number of reported data breaches in Australia for the 2019-20 financial year was 1,050.

For the six months spanning January to June 2020, 518 breaches were notified under the NDB scheme. 124 of those breaches occurred during May, the most reported in any calendar month since the scheme began in February 2018.

Most of these were attributed to human error.

967,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is ready to work with whoever wins the U.S. election, two top Turkish officials said on Friday, despite a friendship with President Donald Trump that has helped the two countries through turbulent times.

Regardless of which candidate takes office in the U.S., we will pursue a sincere approach to improve our relations, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.

The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankaras closer ties with Moscow, its ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and an erosion of rights in Turkey.

Cavusoglu said Turkey had worked with Democrat and Republican administrations alike and overcome difficulties with both.

He spoke as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took a narrow lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia, putting the White House within Bidens reach as undecided states continued to count votes.

Washington has threatened sanctions on Turkey for purchasing Russian missile defence systems but Trumps administration has avoided imposing sanctions.

Of course, individuals have an impact, positive and negative. The sincere friendship between our president and Mr. Trump continued through the most difficult times, Cavusoglu said.

Analysts say Turkeys bilateral ties could suffer if Biden becomes U.S. president. The lira, which is already trading at a record low against the dollar, could come under more pressure.

However Erdogans top aide, Vice President Fuat Oktay, said Ankara was not afraid of sanctions.

No country, including America, has the chance to implement a foreign policy, programme or policy in the region in spite of Turkey or by excluding Turkey, Oktay told broadcaster A Haber.

Turkey is no longer a country which shrinks from, or is scared of, sanctions. Sanctions would increase further our resolve and our determination, he said.",0
888,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday his government would review cooperation over drug policy with the United States and how its agencies operate in Mexico after the recent U.S. arrest of a top military official.

Lopez Obradorâs comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

âWe have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,â Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference.

The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. embassy spokeswoman Adrienne Bory said in a statement to Reuters in the Mexican capital that the United States âvalues its close relationship with Mexico on our shared security challenges.â

âWe look forward to continuing our deep and productive relationship â and many future successes,â the statement said.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEAâs historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard expressed dismay at the U.S. failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos.

âWe have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President (Donald) Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),â Lopez Obrador said.

âBut there are still issues we want to clarify. Weâre only waiting for the elections to pass,â he said of Tuesdayâs U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term.

Lopez Obrador has held up the case of Cienfuegos, who is being held without bail, as an example of rampant corruption in past governments. But he characterized the case as an âisolatedâ event and defended the armyâs role in Mexico.

Cienfuegos was head of the army from 2012 to 2018.",0
841,"President Donald Trumpâs baseless claims that Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden are attempting to ""steal"" the election are gaining momentum on social media, plunging Facebook and Twitter into the most dangerous and volatile period since Election Day.

Goaded by prominent conservatives, Trump supporters are rallying behind election-rigging conspiracies such as #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud, even as results from battleground states put Biden on the brink of winning the presidency.

âWe expect now at this point that these narratives are going to survive the election and last for quite a long time, perhaps becoming either consolidated into existing conspiracy frameworks such as QAnon or becoming the basis of completely new conspiracy theories,â Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said in a press briefing.

Twitter rules would change for Trump: Trump will be a regular citizen on Twitter when his presidency ends

âIf you look at the extent and breadth of the kind of disinformation we are seeing, it seems highly unlikely to us that this activity is going to slack off even after, say, inauguration.â

Long after the election is called, âthere will be a significant portion of people who believe the election was stolen and who will use these narratives as a basis of that belief and then will build upon it,â Stamos, Facebookâs former security chief, said.

While the volume of posts about the election is decreasing, Twitter is seeing a surge in election-related disinformation, according to Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit public interest research group which studies disinformation.

Four of the 10 most shared websites in posts about the 2020 election promoted unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud or sought to document allegations of voter fraud, the research found. #StopTheSteal and #voterfraud were among the top 10 hashtags used.

Artificial intelligence software company Yonder analyzed social media posts including the term âstop the stealâ and found that 99 of the participating accounts were created after Oct. 1 and 55 were created on Nov. 3. These new accounts dominate the volume of posts containing the term, Yonder found.

Politico reported Friday that voter fraud protests across the country are linked to major conservative activist groups and MAGA personalities such as Tea Party Patriots, Women for America First, Turning Point USA and Freedom Works USA.

Confronted with the rapid proliferation of posts and groups making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and encouraging Trump supporters to turn out at street protests, sometimes with violent overtones, Facebook responded Thursday with temporary emergency measures to restrict the spread of false and possibly dangerous content.

Facebook deployed âbreak glassâ tools to police online debate. Itâs demoting content on Facebook and Instagram, including debunked claims about voting. It is also limiting the distribution of live videos that may relate to the election.

""We have developed break-glass tools which do allow us to â if for a temporary period of time â effectively throw a blanket over a lot of content that would freely circulate on our platforms,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, told USA TODAY in September.

Earlier Thursday, Facebook shut down a fast-growing pro-Trump âStop the Stealâ group calling for ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the voteâ over âworrying calls for violence.â

The Facebook group, which attracted more than 350,000 members and nearly 7,000 posts in two days, was being used to organize protests with the rallying cry that Biden was trying to steal the election.

It was named after the hashtag weaponized by President Donald Trump and his allies to boost unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that could delegitimize a Biden win.

âIn line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group âStop the Steal,â which was creating real-world events,â Facebook said in a statement. âThe group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.â

125,"SALT LAKE CITY â A federal judge has frozen the assets of a Utah rare coin dealer after the Utah Department of Commerce and others accused the business and its owner of defrauding at least 200 people of more than $170 million since 2013.

A federal complaint was filed Thursday in Utah by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Rust Rare Coin, Inc. and owner Gaylen Dean Rust.

The Utah Department of Commerce says the company and Rust have defrauded customers in Utah and 16 other states, including receiving ""at least $42 million from investors in a pool that purportedly bought and sold silver,"" according to a press release issued Friday by the Commerce Department in conjunction with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Division of Securities.

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell issued a restraining order freezing the assets of Rust Rare Coin and allowing state and federal officials to ""inspect all relevant records,"" according to the statement.

The company is accused of tricking investors since 2008 into believing it was ""pooling investor money for the purpose of entering into contracts of sale for silver. â¦ (Rust Rare Coin) told investors and prospective investors that they would sell silver held in the pool as market prices rose and buy silver for the pool as market prices fell; thereby increasing the amount of silver held in the 'Silver Pool,' as well as the value of each investorâs share in that pool,"" the statement said.

The Silver Pool, however, was a ""sham,"" according to the statement. Rust Rare Coin, however, ""generated extraordinarily high profits, averaging 20 to 25 percent per year and sometimes as high as 40 percent per year or more. The defendants provided investors with false account statements.""

âAs alleged, for at least a decade, the defendants defrauded their friends, customers, and business associates out of more than $170 million. The defendants allegedly concealed their fraud with false account statements and Ponzi payments,"" Director of Enforcement James McDonald said in a prepared statement.

788,"The Chairman of the Iranian parliament's influential Commission for National Security and Foreign Policy, Mojtaba Zonnour, said that President Hassan Rouhani deserves to be executed a thousand times a day, and that the Iranian people would agree with his views.

In a tweet on Friday, Zonnour wrote, ""The Rt. Hon. Rouhani; if you are justifying negotiations with the enemy by arguing that Imam Hassan reached a peaceful agreement with Mu'awiyah to respect the majority of people's demand; the overwhelming majority of the Iranian people today will not be satisfied with less than your dismissal, and the Supreme Leader of the Revolution should order to execute you one thousand times.""

Shi'ites' second Imam, Hasan ibn Ali (624-670 CE), was elected for the caliphate after his father's death, but abdicated after six or seven months in favor of his opponent Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty.

In a speech on October 14, Rouhani had referred to the events of the advent of Islam, insisting that Imam Hassan made peace with Mu'awiyah because ""the overwhelming majority of society and people"" wanted peace.

Rouhani's critics immediately described the remarks as a prelude to his willingness to negotiate with the United States.

Zonnour criticized Rouhani for the remarks, adding that if ""we were to act according to most people's opinion,"" Rouhani should be condemned to death because the majority of people are dissatisfied with his performance.

Another fundamentalist member of the Majlis Islamic parliament, Mojtaba Rezakhah, also tweeted that Rouhani had misinterpreted Islamic history.

Rezakhah went further by saying that Rouhani had also earlier used another Islamic event -- the martyrdom of Shi'ites' third Imam, and Hassan's younger brother, Hussain ibn Ali -- to lift the sanctions on Iran.

The sanctions not only remained intact, Rezakhah argued, but the value of the Iranian national currency, the rial, dropped tenfold against the dollar.

An influential Friday Prayer Imam, Ahmad Alam ol-Hoda of the city of Mashhad, in northeast Iran, also asserted that Imam Hassan's peace agreement with Mu'awiyah had nothing to do with the people's demands.

""The 'insiders' and 'people accomodating to the enemy' betrayed the Shi'ites' second Imam,"" Alam ol-Hoda added.

Comparing and linking Iranian-U.S negotiations with Imam Hassan's peace accord with Mu'awiyah have a long history in Iranian political literature.

Last May, after the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted in Persian about ""Imam Hassan"" and called him ""the bravest personality in the history of Islam,"" there was much speculation whether the tweet was paving the way for negotiating with the United States.

Responding to the speculations, a news website linked to the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, Tasnim, said that according to Khamenei, since Iranian society was unaware of the facts and Imam Hassan's close allies and insiders were treacherous, he was ""forced"" to come to terms with Mu'awiyah.

""Ayatollah Khamenei does not consider Iran's current situation similar to the period Imam Hassan made peace with Mu'awiyah,"" Tasnim reiterated.

In a speech in early July 2015, Rouhani also invoked the historic peace made in the year 661 by his namesake, Imam Hassan, to step down in favor of Mu'awiyah and prevent a new war between the then-emerging Sunni and Shiite sects. ""Imam Hassan made an important decision during difficult circumstances that could have destroyed the Muslim community,"" Rouhani said, praising Imam's decision as ""heroic flexibility.""

Following his words, fundamentalists and close allies of Khamenei blasted Rouhani with a barrage of criticism.

Nevertheless, days later on July 14, 2015, with the approval of Khamenei, Iran joined with other world powers to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement.

However, with President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, Rouhani's critics have asserted that the current situation could not be compared with Imam Hassan's time, about 1400 years ago.

In its editorial last Thursday, the fundamentalist daily Resalat referred to the same argument, writing that Rouhani neither understands politics nor religion.",0
316,"Collin County Man Found Guilty of Financial Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme Victimizing Senior Citizens, School Districts, and Charities

Defendant Engaged in Identity Theft, Cyber Fraud, and Elder Fraud,

Laundering Money for Nigerian Co-Conspirators

SHERMAN, Texas âA 30-year-old Plano, Texas man has been convicted of federal violations related to a bank fraud and money laundering conspiracy in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox today.

Babatope Joseph Aderinoye was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering; wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and mail fraud. The guilty verdict came following a four-day trial before U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant.

âWe are committed to protecting East Texas victimsâand especially our senior citizensâfrom financial threats, both foreign and domestic,â said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox. âWe will hold perpetrators of these fraudulent schemes accountable wherever they are and will use all tools at our disposal to punish offenders and recover their ill-gotten gains.â

According to information presented in court, Aderinoye would obtain fake passports in the names of others. He would then use those fraudulent passports and the identifying information of others to establish false business entities and fraudulent bank accounts. To this date, 13 individual aliases and 12 business aliases have been tied to Aderinoye, and there is evidence to suggest more aliases exist. Once Aderinoye would open the fraudulent bank accounts, co-conspirators would engage in various business email compromise scams and telephone compromise scams to defraud individuals and businesses out of money. In these scams, co-conspirators would pose as a known individual and direct the targeted victims to wire or send funds to Aderinoye or the fraudulent accounts Aderinoye had set up. Once the money hit Aderinoyeâs fraudulent accounts, he would immediately withdraw the funds, transfer them to other fraudulent accounts, or wire them internationally to a bank account he had set up in Nigeria. The illicit proceeds were used to pay off co-conspirators and further fund their fraudulent schemes. From June 2018 through September 2019, over $6.7 million was deposited into alias accounts of Aderinoye, with almost all of those funds being withdrawn or wired internationally. The victims of the BEC scams included school districts such as Community ISD, Project 4031, a non-profit organization that helps families of the terminally ill, an individual whose identity was used to drain his retirement account, and an elderly man who had over $352,000 stolen from his investment account. The investigation is ongoing, as co-conspirators and victims continue to be identified.

Under federal statutes, Aderinoye faces up to 30 years in federal prison at sentencing. The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.

This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Wes Wynne and Will Tatum.",1
745,"Founded in 2008 after more than a decade of research at Stanford, Silicon Valley-based startup, Ayasdi, is on a mission to reinvent the methods by which we transform Big Data into actionable knowledge. Essentially, Ayasdi aims to automate the insight discovery process, allowing end users to find valuable intelligence within massive datasets almost instantaneously. Backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation, the startupâs novel synthesis of machine learning and data analysis technologies has not gone unnoticed by investors.

Today, the startup announced that it has raised $10 million in series A financing, led by Khosla Ventures and Floodgate. The new round brings the startupâs total funding to $13.25 million, which includes contributions both from its current investors as well as angel investors like Michael Ovitz, Steve Blank and The Data Collectiveâs Matt Ocko, to name a few.

The investment comes at a time when venture capital is beginning to shift from consumer businesses to the enterprise, as investors look to capitalize on the rise of the big data app and the growing demand for a new data infrastructure.

In fact, Research firm IDC recently predicted that the Big Data market is poised for exponential growth over the next few years, with total revenue projected to reach $24 billion by 2016. Whatâs more, following Derrick Harrisâ logic, if one includes analytics software (arguably an essential segment of the Big Data market) in that definition, then the total is actually upwards of $75 billion.

Yet, in spite of this enormous new market opportunity, the emergence of Big Data doesnât necessarily directly translate into a net positive for business, humankind, etc. In other words, people tend to conflate information and data, such that we end up believing that more data inherently means (proportionately) more information, which in turn means (proportionately) more intelligence, insight and value. However, as Dr. Michael Wu points out, itâs quite literally the opposite: âThe more data you have, the less information you gain as a proportion of the data.â

The true value of Big Data is derived from the insights hidden within, yet, while all insights are information, not all information produces insight. Big Data is composed of enormous amounts of unstructured data, a wide array of data types and media, but the amount of insight that can be extracted from that data is proportionately tiny.

Big Data continues to grow, yet, while governments, businesses and scientists have spent years (and millions of dollars) attempting to address the worldâs biggest problems by analyzing Big Data, progress has been incremental. Although Big Data tools have improved over time, Ayasdi is of the mindset that they are still failing to yield the kind of breakthrough insights that lead to true innovation.

The Ayasdi co-founders attribute this to the prevailing reliance among data scientists on old models â finding insights by asking questions and writing queries. The problem with this is that queries are inherently based on human assumptions and biases, and, in turn, query results tend to only reveal slices of data, rather than providing visibility into the relationships between similar groups of data. This method of discovering insight in Big Data tends to rely heavily on iterative guesswork and chance, and thus takes time to produce real results.

To address this problem, Ayasdi is today officially launching its cloud-based insight discovery platform, which aims to deliver insight derived from massive datasets quickly, without relying on queries. The machine learning platform combines computer science with a branch of mathematics called âTopological Data Analysis,â which allows Ayasdi to visualize entire datasets at once.

The startupâs platform uses hundreds of machine learning algorithms to explore these complex datasets â the goal being the automatic discovery of insights that could not be discovered through ad hoc or query-based methods. The platform, which is designed for domain experts, data scientists and researchers, requires no coding or modeling and offers the kind of scalability that more demanding processing requires. It also is built to complement other Big Data solutions companies might already be using and is able to work with datasets of any size or type, the co-founders tell us.

The startup is currently working with enterprise customers in financial services, life sciences, oil and gas and the public sector, with these companies employing its platform to help discover new drugs, for example, improve cancer therapy by discovering new insights from an 11-year old breast cancer dataset that included new sub-populations of breast cancer survivors, for example. Itâs also being used to explore new energy sources, identifying patterns that can lead to more accurate drilling, predict fraud and help prevent terrorist attacks.

âThe answers to todayâs most important scientific, business and social problems lie in data,â saus Ayasdi CEO Gurjeet Singh. âThe biggest challenge in Big Data today is asking the right questions of data, so the real opportunity in Big Data lies in the automation of insight discovery â regardless of the complexity of that data â without requiring users to ask questions. The goal is for Ayasdi to provide users with answers to questions that they didnât know to ask in the first place.â",0
372,"As Venezuelas oil-based economy continues to crumble, a politically connected class of businessmen with financial ties to Miami has grown fabulously wealthy from energy deals with the socialist government. Among the Venezuelan upper crust who have made fortunes during the Bolivarian revolution: Alejandro Betancourt.

Without any experience in the energy industry, Betancourt co-founded a power company called Derwick Associates a decade ago that has reaped billions of dollars in government contracts for a string of new plants in Venezuela  drawing barbs about being overpaid for the projects and having cozy relationships with top politicians.

With his windfall, Betancourt not only expanded his business into the United States but also bought a penthouse apartment in Manhattans Olympic Tower, along with a castle estate and other luxury properties in Spain, according to court documents.

In Miami, Betancourt has surfaced in a massive money laundering case that charges his cousin and several of the so-called Boliburgueses  young , well-educated entrepreneurs close to the Venezuelan regime  with conspiring to bribe government officials to approve a loan scheme to embezzle $1.2 billion from the countrys national oil company during the presidency of Nicolas Maduro.

Although Betancourt is not identified by name in the federal case filed in Miami, several sources familiar with the widening investigation say that he is Conspirator 2 among the dozen unnamed Venezuelan conspirators and officials listed in a criminal complaint that details the alleged international racket.

Betancourt, 39, and some of the other unidentified conspirators and officials could be added as defendants to an indictment, according to sources familiar with the federal case. So far, nine defendants have been charged in the Miami case, with two pleading guilty and one awaiting trial. The remaining six defendants, including Betancourts cousin, Francisco Convit Guruceaga, are considered fugitives by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Miami.

Betancourts attorney, prominent Miami lawyer Jon Sale, issued a statement Friday denying his involvement. My client denies any wrongdoing, Sale said.

In Miami, Houston and New York, several corruption cases have been pursued by the Justice Department alleging bribery, embezzlement and money laundering activities in Venezuela and the United States that have taken a devastating toll on Venezuelas economy. The country has suffered the loss of billions of dollars embezzled from its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A, or PDVSA, mainly because of green-palming between government officials and the countrys elite business class, federal authorities say.

Russell Dallen, a lawyer and investment manager, spoke about foreign corruption at the Latin America Summit on Friday in Miami, spotlighting the prosecution of the PDVSA money-laundering case and others. Dallen, head of Caracas Capital in Miami, said Venezuelas rampant corruption has caused dramatic declines in oil production and income over the past two decades, fueling hyperinflation, widespread poverty and the exodus of more than four million people.

Instead of reinvesting the money and rebuilding the country, it was all stolen through these currency-exchange and loan schemes, said Dallen, pointing out that Venezuela was once among the biggest oil producers in the world.

The Venezuelan people are starving, he added. The [minimum wage] is $5 a month, up from $2. Thats all they make  its less than Haiti, less than Cuba. Thats why people are voting with their feet and leaving the country.

In the Miami case, federal court records say that Conspirator 2 was among the ring of Boliburgueses and government officials who received hundreds of million of dollars in late 2014 from PDVSA as payment for a loan that they made to the state-owned oil company. A criminal affidavit alleges the ring used a shell company to loan $42 million worth of bolivars and then got repaid in euros at the governments favorable exchange rate. That currency exchange transaction instantly multiplied the loan repayment to the equivalent of $600 million.

Betancourts cousin, Convit, who also sits on the board of directors of Derwicks Oil and Gas Corp., is the lead defendant mentioned with Conspirator 2 in the introduction to the complaint affidavit.

Betancourts chief financial officer at Derwick, Orlando Alvarado, is listed as Conspirator 4 in the Miami case and also as an associate of his cousin, Convit. According to the affidavit, Conspirator 4 discussed a plan in 2016 with one of the rings leaders to create fake foreign currency exchange contracts to make the embezzlement of the national oil companys funds look legitimate so the proceeds could be transferred to Convit and several others, including Conspirator 2 and Venezuelan officials accused of accepting bribes.

Conspirator 4 [Alvarado] suggested a meeting with everyone who has an interest to sort things out and fix the papers before things get bad when it is too late, the affidavit says.

The close relationship between Convit, Betancourt and Alvarado raises questions about what Betancourt knew of the alleged loan scheme at Venezuelas state-owned oil company and the flow of laundered money. The detailed affidavit, however, does not provide evidence of Betancourts knowledge of the illicit PDVSA loan scheme. Nor does it provide proof, such as a bank record or wire transfer, showing he was aware of the source of the laundered money he allegedly received.

According to the affidavit filed in July of last year, PDVSA repaid the rings loan to a shell company called Rantor Capital, transferring the $600 million to Portmann Capital Management in Malta. The oil companys loan repayment was eventually turned over to another shell company, Eaton Global Services Limited, set up in Hong Kong, which was controlled by the Venezuelan leaders of the money-laundering conspiracy, federal prosecutors say.

The $600 million windfall was then divided up among the group of wealthy Venezuelan businessmen, the three stepsons of Maduro and PDVSA officials, according to an email obtained by agents with Homeland Security Investigations and sources familiar with the criminal case. The president and his stepsons  Yosser Gavídia Flores, Walter Gavídia Flores and Yoswal Gavídia Flores  are under investigation in the Miami case, sources said.

According to the affidavit, here is how the government funds were distributed in in late 2014 and early 2015:

? $272.5 million went to Raul Gorrín, the Venezuelan tycoon who owns a Caracas TV network, insurance company and other businesses. He has not been charged in the Miami case, but is considered a main suspect in the federal investigation. In turn, Gorrín kept about $72.5 million for himself  wiring some money to pay for aviation, yacht and brokerage services in Miami  and gave the balance, $200 million, to Portmann Capital Management for the benefit of Maduros three grown stepsons from his marriage to Cilia Flores.

? That account was set up for the stepsons in the name of a straw representative, Mario Enrique Bonilla Vallera, a Venezuelan businessman who owns a handful of Florida companies with addresses linked to four multimillion-dollar homes in the exclusive Cocoplum neighborhood of Coral Gables. Bonilla has been charged in the money-laundering indictment, but remains at large.

? $272.5 million also went to Convit and Conspirator 2. Of that total, $94 million was distributed to Pedro Binaggia, an attorney and businessman who was tasked to launder millions of dollars from Venezuela to Europe and the United States. (In 2016, Binaggia became a confidential source for Homeland Security Investigations out of fear that he would get caught laundering funds.)

? Binaggia redistributed about $20 million to: Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, former legal counsel for the Venezuelan Ministry of Oil and Mining; Abraham Edgardo Ortega, a former director of finance at PDVSA; Jose Vicente Amparan Croquer, described as a professional money launderer, and three other unnamed Venezuelan conspirators with ties to the state-owned oil company.

Those three are Victor Eduardo Aular Blanco, a former PDVSA vice president of finance who authorized the state-owned oil companys loan with the ring; Alvaro Ledo Nass, a former PDVSA general counsel, and his lawyer-brother, Adolfo Ledo Nass, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

The remaining funds were absorbed by the cost of the initial loan to the oil company and Portmann Capitals charges related to the transaction.

Significantly, some of Venezuelas embezzled money was funneled through shell companies into fabricated investment funds, U.S. banks and South Florida luxury real estate, forming the foundation for the federal money-laundering case in Miami. Gorrin, who was close to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as well as Maduro, invested tens of millions of dollars in Cocoplum and in luxury condominiums in Miami and Manhattan.

The news media in Venezuela and the United States have focused on Gorrin because of his high profile in business and political circles. Although he has not been charged in the Maduro-era money laundering case, Gorrin has been indicted in a similar $1 billion bribery and embezzlement scheme involving the former Venezuelan treasurer, Alejandro Andrade, in the Chavez administration. Andrade, who cooperated with federal authorities, has already pleaded and begun a 10-year prison sentence..

Betancourt, though less well known, exerts tremendous influence in Venezuela as well. A graduate of Suffolk University in Boston, Betancourt founded Derwick a decade ago with Pedro Trebbau Lopez, the energy companys vice president. (Trebbau has not been implicated in the ongoing Venezuelan kleptocracy case in Miami.) Betancourt and Trebbau made immediate inroads with the Chavez administration as it looked for private partners in the oil and energy industries.

Ever since, Derwick has been surrounded by controversy. At times, the company has been accused of corruption for obtaining huge energy construction contracts from the Venezuelan government without having the required know-how. The company has also been accused of overcharging for the installation of used and inadequate equipment.

According to a 128-page report on the energy sector written by ONG Transparencia Venezuela, the local chapter of Transparency International, Derwick was awarded 11 construction contracts worth $5 billion. But the government contracts were overbilled by $2.9 billion, an average increase of 162 percent, the report says.

José Aguilar, an engineer who was tasked with investigating Derwick for the Wall Street Journal, said the company records he reviewed suggests that it charged the Venezuelan government between $2 billion and $2.2 billion for the 11 projects  work that could have been done for between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.

There was at least $800 million in overbilling, Aguilar told el Nuevo Herald, noting the company hired inexpensive contractors to do much of its work.

But a study written by a professor at the Simon Bolivar University in Caracas commended Derwicks work, saying it was one of the few government energy contractors that actually completed their plants within budgets.

But not all of Derwicks plants came online, and at least one never produced electricity, Aguilar said. The output of all these plants has been traditionally poor, he said.

Derwicks rapid rise led to confrontations with a leading financial institution, Banco Venezolano de Credito, which adopted an anti-Chavez stand and accused the energy company of being in league with the president. The rivals accusations sparked defamation lawsuits, with Derwick firing the first salvo with a libel suit in Miami.

Then, Otto J. Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela and diplomat in three Republican administrations, was hired by the Venezuelan bank to take on Derwick in a public relations war. Reich himself ended up suing Betancourt and other Derwick officials in a libel case filed in New York federal court, accusing them of paying bribes to Venezuelan government officials. Reichs suit against Betancourt, Derwicks CEO, and its vice president, Trebbau, was dismissed. After the dismissal, Reich reached a confidential settlement with a third defendant in 2016.

Derwicks Betancourt and Alvarado have been collaborating on energy- and oil-related business deals for years.

Betancourt and Alvarado made headlines in 2015, when they became major shareholders in a Panama-based company called OHara that sought to take control of a Canadian oil company, Pacific Rubiales, which ran some of Colombias largest oil fields.

According to press reports, OHara joined with other investors to acquire about 20 percent of Pacific Rubialess shares, establishing the group as the companys largest shareholders. But Betancourts investment push  along with his becoming a member of Pacific Rubiales board  led to strained relations with the companys original shareholders.

Facing imminent bankruptcy amid falling oil prices, the Canadian oil company was sold to another investment group in an emergency transaction  but Betancourt, Alvarado and other investors lost millions in the end.

Betancourt and Alvarado continue to face potential trouble as they come under scrutiny in the Miami money-laundering case. It is moving along, despite the absence of six defendants who are at large in Venezuela and possibly elsewhere.

Matthias Krull, an international banker who catered to mega-rich Venezuelans including Gorrin, pleaded guilty soon after his arrest in July of last year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Krull admitted that he was retained by Gorrin to help launder some of the Venezuelan rings $600 million from Europe to the United States in 2016, including efforts to move $200 million through straw representatives for Maduros three stepsons..

But Krull has been allowed to remain free on a bond in Miami because of the value of his cooperation with the U.S. Attorneys Office, according to his lawyer, Oscar S. Rodriguez.

Krull, the German-born son of a Lutheran pastor who was raised in Venezuela and educated in Switzerland, was based in Panama as a banker for the Swiss bank Julius Baer before his arrest. According to court records, he has helped investigators understand the complex web of relationships between the defendants and other suspects in the huge money laundering case.

Mr. Krulls value actually comes from the fact that he has been a banker in Venezuela ... for a long time, prosecutor Michael Nadler said in September while alerting a federal judge that he would be recommending a sentence reduction for Krull when he surrenders in March. The amount of people that he has put us in contact with ... is large.

Abraham Edgardo Ortega, a former executive director of financial planning at PDVSA, also pleaded guilty a year ago to accepting millions of dollars in bribes that were secretly wired to U.S. and other financial institutions with the assistance of a Miami investment manager and others.

Ortega, who worked at PDVSA for more than a decade, admitted he used his official role to give priority status to Venezuelan companies that did business with the government so they could tap into its vast oil income to make overnight fortunes through loan and currency exchange schemes. He has been free on bond while cooperating with authorities and still awaits sentencing.

In February, Miami investment manager Gustavo Hernandez Frieri faces trial on charges of helping launder at least $12 million in bribery payments to Ortega. Hernandezs alleged role was to put that money into a fake mutual fund so that it looked legitimate and then launder it into U.S. banks for a fee.

Hernandez, who lives in the exclusive Bay Point neighborhood of Miami and ran his business from a Brickell Avenue office, remains free on bond. Nadler, the prosecutor, indicated in court that Hernandez may not go to trial because he and his attorney Michael Pasano, are in discussions about pleas and that the terms are still being worked out.",1

Regxsa has got the help of Romanian software development company Fortech for the launch of this Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution.

âThe concept behind Alexis is to enhance the capability of investigators to take decisions.

622,"Canada's embattled Prime Minister Paul Martin has promised to call a general election once a corruption inquiry involving his Liberal Party is over.

Investigators in the cash-for-contracts scandal are expected to report their findings in mid-December, meaning a poll would be held in January.

But there are doubts Mr Martin will be able to hold on to power until then.

The three opposition parties are threatening to force a confidence motion in May.

Opposition anger

An inquiry into the affair has heard that Liberals in Quebec demanded kickbacks for rewarding advertising contracts.

Money earmarked for a programme to counter separatism in French-speaking Quebec was allegedly paid to Liberal-friendly advertising firms, who did little work in return.

On Thursday, Mr Martin apologised for his party's misdemeanours, calling the situation an ""unjustifiable mess"".

""Those who are in power are to be held responsible, and that includes me,"" he said on national television.

""I was the minister of finance and knowing what I have learned in the past year, I am sorry that I was not more vigilant.""

He said those who had ""violated the public trust"" would be ""identified and will pay the consequences"".

He said the poll would be called within 30 days of the judicial inquiry issuing its final report.

Mr Martin runs a minority government, having lost his majority in the Canadian House of Commons in last June's election because of public anger at the scandal.

If the parties - the Conservatives, Bloc Quebecois and New Democrats - remain united, Mr Martin may have to go to the polls in June.

BBC correspondent in Toronto Lee Carter said the opposition was angry that the prime minister had used the public airwaves to argue his case.",0
969,"Democrat Mark Kelly has defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona, NBC News projected on Friday, giving Democrats a Senate pickup in the state.

Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, declared himself the winner earlier in the week.

""I am deeply honored that Arizonans have trusted me to be their next United States Senator and to serve in this seat once held by Senator John McCain,"" he said in a series of tweets Wednesday night.

""We woke up today still facing a pandemic, a struggling economy, and deep division in our country,"" he wrote. ""We need to slow the spread of the virus, get our economy back on track, and defend health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And I know that together, we can.""

Kelly, 56, is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in 2011 at a constituent event. The couple founded the Giffords Foundation, which supports gun control laws around the country.

The win puts both of the states Senate seats in the hands of Democrats - Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. Sinema congratulated Kelly in a tweeted statement Wednesday. ""I am confident Mark will uphold the Arizona values of seeking common ground and putting country above party,"" she wrote.

The win solidifies Arizonas swing-state status after years of Republican control, and comes as Democrats suffered a series of setbacks in their hopes of taking control of the Senate. They flipped one seat in Colorado, but lost another in Alabama and their big-money pushes aimed at unseating Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins in Maine both failed.

Although they held a seat in a tight race in Michigan, they're also trying to flip a seat where they're currently trailing in North Carolina and two seats in historically conservative Georgia, at least one of which is projected to head to a runoff on Jan. 5.

Kelly, in his first bid for public office, ran as a moderate who would be above the partisan bickering in Washington.

McSally was appointed to the seat in 2018 after the death of John McCain. Tuesday was a special election for the last two years of McCains term  the winner on Tuesday will have to run for re-election in two years  and was viewed as a must-win for Democrats' Senate hopes.

McSally trailed Kelly in the polls throughout the race and raised significantly less money.

McSally, a former Air Force pilot who opposed Donald Trump in 2016, found herself in a difficult position trying to hold on to the presidents base supporters while also appealing to moderates who would decide the election. McSally campaigned on multiple occasions with Trump and did little to distance herself from his administration.

Trump also created unique problems for McSally in Arizona because of his unpopularity with older voters, suburban voters and Mormons, key voting groups in the state. The Republican Partys relative stability among some Hispanic voters also did not benefit McSally quite as much in Arizona, where most of the fast-growing Hispanic population is Mexican American, a group that tends to be less conservative than Cuban Americans.

McSally argued that despite Kellys independent rhetoric, he would vote to advance a liberal agenda if he were elected, echoing an attack Trump frequently used against Joe Biden and calling him counterfeit Kelly.

Kelly repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would vote for Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, to be majority leader if the party takes control of the Senate, and refused to stake out a position on whether he would vote to eliminate the filibuster.

In his tweets Wednesday, Kelly said, ""I am preparing for the job of being an independent voice for all Arizonans, regardless of who they voted for.""",0
262,"Two months before one of the world's largest data leaks, dubbed the Panama Papers, was made public on Sunday, Brazilian prosecutors accused the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at the center of the leak, of corruption. (The firm, whose leaked records span 40 years and make up the Panama Papers, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), issued a statement to the ICIJ denying any unlawful activities. In addition, it stated that ties to offshore companies is not an implication of wrongdoing.)

On January 27 Brazil's Federal Police, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash (""OperaÃ§Ã£o Lava Jato""), accused the firm of helping clients create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. Prosecutors alleged that the firm was using real estate company OAS Empreendimentos ImobiliÃ¡rios S/A to help cover up money made in the criminal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Six temporary arrests were made and 16 search warrants were issued. Lawyers representing those arrested denied any wrongdoing or irregularities. FORBES has been unable to reach the firm for comment. Aside from its office in Brazil, the firm also has branches in 40 other cities.

According to the ICIJ, which on Sunday began sharing information on the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca's cofounder RamÃ³n Fonseca, an adviser to Panama's president, ""took a leave of absence as presidential adviser in March after his firm was implicated in the Brazil scandal and ICIJ and its partners began to ask questions about the law firmâs practices.""

At least 29 billionaires and former billionaires have been outed for allegedly having ties to offshore wealth (see story here). No Brazilian billionaires have been named so far. According to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, several current and former Brazilian government officials belonging to almost every political party are allegedly implicated. Among them, JoÃ£o Lyra, a former deputy and once Brazil's richest parliament member according to the ICIJ, was named for not disclosing an offshore holding or Swiss bank account. According to Brazilian law, individuals are allowed to have offshore accounts as long as they are registered in the country for tax purposes. Lyra has not commented on the leak. IdalÃ©cio de Castro Rodrigues de Oliveira, a Portuguese business executive accused of allegedly supplying cash used to bribe Eduardo Cunha, the president of Brazilâs Chamber of Deputies, was also named for creating offshore companies right before the alleged bribe took place. De Oliveira didn't comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.

In addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz GalvÃ£o family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo PetrÃ³polis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz GalvÃ£o released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.

Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as âLulaâ (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and refuses to step down, claiming that she is the victim of a coup attempt by rivals.",1
516,"The founder and chief executive officer of Backpage.com, a website linked to human trafficking, has pleaded guilty to charges including conspiring to facilitate prostitution and money laundering.

Carl Ferrer, 57, of Frisco, Texas, will face a maximum of five years in prison. Part of his plea agreement with federal and state authorities includes forfeiting all corporate assets related to the website and making sure it's permanently shuttered.

Federal authorities seized control of the website last week so ""it can no longer be used by criminals to promote and facilitate human trafficking,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement released by the Department of Justice on Thursday.

""For far too long, Backpage.com existed as the dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults alike,"" Sessions said. ""But this illegality stops right now.""

Ferrer ""has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution using a facility in interstate or foreign commerce and to engage in money laundering,"" according to the DOJ statement.

Ferrer's plea deal also covers Backpage-related charges in California and Texas, according to court documents.

California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra said Ferrer pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of money laundering. As part of the deal, Ferrer will cooperate in aiding the prosecution of two controlling shareholders of the website. Those cases remain in Sacramento Superior Court.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Ferrer pleaded guilty to money laundering and that his company is pleading guilty to human trafficking.

""According to the factual basis of his plea agreement, Ferrer admitted that he had long been aware that the great majority of Backpage's 'escort' and 'adult' advertisements are, in fact, advertisements for prostitution services, which are not protected by the First Amendment and which are illegal in 49 states and in much of Nevada,"" the DOJ statement said. ""Ferrer further admitted that he conspired with other Backpage principals to find ways to knowingly facilitate the state-law prostitution crimes being committed by Backpage's customers.""

Since 2004, according to the DOJ, Backpage ""has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from publishing 'escort' and 'adult' ads.""",1
366,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in trouble yet again for trying to get a free ride. It recently came out that back in June, he had requested a government plane to take his wife on their honeymoon in Europe, with the lame justification that he needed secure communications. This was counter to standard government practice  as a former White House ethics counsel explains, you don't need a private plane to have a secure phone or internet connection  and Mnuchin didn't get the request approved.

Still, it's both a blackly amusing story, and a window into an administration that is absolutely suffused with penny-ante corruption. If there's anything that characterizes basic government operation under President Trump, it is constant grifting.

This is something of a pattern for the secretary. Before this latest revelation, Mnuchin got in trouble for the exact same reason, when he took his wife Louise Linton on a government plane to Fort Knox, Kentucky, during the solar eclipse. Linton posted a shockingly gauche picture of the trip on Instagram, showing her and Mnuchin descending from a government plane, carefully noting the names of all the hyper-expensive designer clothing she was wearing with hashtags (#valentino).

Then when someone commented about the taxpayer expense, Linton came unglued in typical elitist fashion, as Jia Tolentino notes:

In a few aggrieved sentences, Linton managed to frame her husbands $300 million net worth as a burden, her six months in Washington as harrowing public servitude, and an ordinary American as a contemptible member of the economic underclass. She punctuated this bit with two emoji, a flexed bicep, and a kissy face, which were meant to convey nonchalance but instead communicated a type of strained, hierarchical female fury that I have not witnessed in person since cheerleading camp, in 2005. [ The New Yorker ]

Then on Thursday last week, Mnuchin dug himself in even deeper. At a Politico conference, he managed to strain credulity to the breaking point while also scoffing that only stupid country rubes (e.g. Trump voters) could care about an eclipse anyway. ""Being a New Yorker and [also from] California, I was like, the eclipse? Really?"" he said. ""I don't have any interest in watching the eclipse."" Yeah, sure Steve. It was merest coincidence that you took your wife to within a few dozen miles of the eclipse totality zone during the 45 minutes that it passed by.

All these episodes make for a combination of deeply irritating rich New Yorker elitism and Mobutu-esque abuse of the public fisc. Somewhat by coincidence, Linton is also notorious for publishing a ""memoir"" about a gap year in Zambia, where she supposedly had dangerous encounters with rebels fighting the Second Congo War. Locals  as well as anyone who had been to Zambia at the time  immediately pointed out that many of the lurid details were obviously invented (and full of disgusting racist stereotypes to boot). They pulled the book, and it cannot now be purchased on Amazon.

However, all this is just the tip of the iceberg for the Trump administration. Since Trump took office, there have been a constant trickle of stories of him abusing his position as president to enrich himself, his family, and his businesses  from his daughter getting patents from China on the same day he met with the Chinese president, to charging the Secret Service to use his golf carts or an obscene rent in Trump Tower, to a revelation on Friday that the government had paid $1,092 for officials in the National Security Council to stay at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.

Corruption is even being given official sanction. Last week it came out that the Office of Government Ethics (whose chief resigned in protest in July, saying the U.S. has become ""close to a laughingstock"" on ethics) will allow legal defense funds for aides caught up in the Russia investigation to accept anonymous donations from lobbyists.

Trump could probably just write himself a billion-dollar check from the Treasury (or perhaps print a billion-dollar platinum coin, with his face on it of course), but that appears to be beyond his imagination. Instead, it's going to be an endless parade of this kind of relatively small-bore looting. That is almost certainly why Mnuchin feels comfortable asking for a $25,000-per-hour perk. If everyone else has their hands in the till, why not him?",1

A former Mexican security minister has been arrested in the US, charged with taking bribes from a drugs cartel.

Genaro García Luna is accused of allowing the Sinaloa cartel of ""El Chapo"" Guzman to operate in Mexico in exchange for millions of dollars.

Prosecutors say Mr García Luna gave the cartel safe passage for drug shipments and access to sensitive information.

They say that on two occasions cartel members delivered up to $5m (£3.7m) in two briefcases to him in person.

He has previously denied any wrongdoing.

Mr García Luna, 52, served as public security chief in the administration of President Felipe Calderon between 2006 and 2012.

His arrest in Texas is a major development in Mexican politics, the BBC's Mexico correspondent Will Grant reports.

Mr García Luna was not just an important figure in Mr Calderon's administration - he was Mexico's secretary of public security, the face of the country's federal police force, our correspondent adds.

Mr Calderon, with US backing, deployed troops against the cartels for the first time. Tens of thousands died in Mexico in drug-related violence during his ""war on drugs"".

Mr García Luna was taken into custody in Dallas, Texas, on Monday, prosecutors in New York said.

Court documents unsealed on Tuesday in Brooklyn showed he had been charged with cocaine trafficking conspiracy and making false statements.

""García Luna stands accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from 'El Chapo' Guzman's Sinaloa cartel while he controlled Mexico's Federal Police Force and was responsible for ensuring public safety in Mexico,"" said US Attorney Richard Donoghue, announcing the arrest.

He was also accused of lying about his criminal past when he applied for US naturalisation in 2018.

Guzmán was jailed for life in July following a three-month trial in the US.

During that trial, ex-cartel member Jesus ""Rey"" Zambada alleged that he had personally delivered two suitcases containing millions of dollars in bribes to Mr García Luna at a restaurant.

Mr García Luna denied those allegations at the time, calling them ""lies, defamation and perjury"".

US prosecutors allege that the former minister used his position to protect the Sinaloa cartel's trafficking operations from 2001 to 2012, enabling it to operate ""with impunity"" in Mexico.

If found guilty, he faces between 10 years to life in prison.",1

Former finance professor and Macquarie Bank executive Dr Tony Castagna is behind bars after a Supreme Court jury found him guilty of tax evasion, money laundering and dealing with the proceeds of crime.

Castagna, 70, is facing a maximum jail term of 25 years after the jury found that over a nine-year period up until 2008 he deliberately and dishonestly concealed from the Australian Tax Office millions of dollars in fees and bonuses he received while working as a consultant to Macquarie Bank.

Also found guilty was Castagnas cousin Robert Agius, a former accountant in the tax haven of Vanuatu, who conspired with Castagna to conceal the money.

Agius, who grew up in the same household as Castagna, is already serving a non-parole period of six years and eight months jail, after being found guilty in 2012 for operating unrelated tax avoidance schemes via his Vanuatu-based accountancy firm.

The jury heard that on May 21, 2008, the AFP executed search warrants at Castagnas home in Gordon, on Sydneys north shore, as well as at his Macquarie Bank office.

This followed raids by the AFP, in conjunction with Vanuatu police, on the Port Vila home and office of then Vanuatu-based accountant Agius.

The AFP had been intercepting Agiuss phone prior to his arrest in April 2008. Intercepted calls played to the jury revealed the pairs reluctance to discuss their financial dealings over the phone. In one call Castagna was heard suggesting Agius use Lizs cell phone.

Agius and Castagna were also found guilty of money laundering in that they conspired to deal with property knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The Crown case was that $4.5 million of Castagnas money hidden offshore was channeled back to Australia so that he could buy investment properties in the Newcastle area.

To avoid tax, the jury heard the money was returned to Castagna by way of sham loans from Agius.

Apart from facing the possible confiscation of his property under proceeds of crime legislation, the ATO is also pursuing Castanga for unpaid taxes and penalties in excess of $10 million.

Castagna is understood to have shares worth $26 million, held via offshore entity Blackall Ltd, in cyber security company Nuix, which is majority-owned by Macquarie Bank.

Castagna is currently a director of Nuix, which helps protect the cyber secrets of and detect financial crimes for their clients which include the Serious Fraud Office in Britain, US Department of Homeland Security, the Australian Defence Force and ASIC.

Two of Nuixs major clients are the Australian Federal Police and the ATO. It was through the efforts of these two government agencies tax-avoidance probe Project Wickenby that Castagna now faces a maximum of ten years for defrauding the ATO and 25 years for money laundering.

Justice Christine Adamson refused bail for Castagna ahead of his sentencing hearing on 25 May.

868,"European interior ministers have pushed the fight against terrorism to the top of their agenda following last monthâs attacks in Paris, Nice and Vienna.

In a joint statement issued on the fifth anniversary of the November 13 attacks in France, the interior ministers pledged to work towards the faster removal of terrorist content from social media networks.

They agreed to finalise negotiations on regulations for removing terrorist content by the end of the year.

""The aim is to enable issuing removal orders with cross-border effect to create a new and rapid and effective instrument to counter terrorist content online within an hour or less of its being reported, while maintaining effective safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights,"" the ministers said in the statement.

They also agreed to reinforce external borders, stating: ""We want to strengthen and further develop options for security measures within the Schengen area as well as instruments for cross-border law enforcement cooperation.""

There have already been a number of operational reinforcements to Schengen including the creation of European border guards, Yves Pascouau, from the think tank Res Publica, told Euronews earlier this week.

A strengthened role for Interpol in intelligence sharing is among the ideas that were being discussed in the virtual meeting hosted by European Commissioner Ylva Johansson.

Ministers will present ""comprehensive Council conclusions on internal security and on a European police partnership"" in December, the joint statement issued on Friday stated.

""We need to do even more to protect our European values, our European society and our European citizens,"" said Johansson. âThey want us to do more and to cooperate more and I think this is necessary.â

Migration had been due to top the agenda of Fridayâs meeting, but this was pushed down the list of priorities in the wake of the latest wave of terror attacks to hit the continent.",0
1011,"Gaston Browne is the 4th and current Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, in office since 2014. He led the Antigua Labour Party to victory in the June 2014 general election.

Browne was appointed to the position of Commercial Banking Manager in the Swiss American Banking Group, having served for many years in the Group, which was a major banking consortium in Antigua and Barbuda, comprising offshore and onshore banks and a trust company. In 1999, Browne answered an obvious call to promote the welfare of his fellow citizens by entering the political arena. He was duly appointed as the Parliamentary Representative for the Constituency of St. John's City West. His outstanding dedication and commitment to service and distinguished credentials in the field of finance propelled him to the portfolio of Minister of Planning, Trade, Industry, Commerce and Public Service Affairs in his very first term as an MP.

Gaston attended the City Banking College in the United Kingdom, where he gained a first degree in banking and later pursued studies at the University of Manchester, he earning an MBA in Finance.

Gaston Browne led the Antigua Labour Party to victory in the 12 June 2014 general election, after 10 years in opposition, winning 14 out of 17 seats. Browne was sworn in as Prime Minister on 13 June 2014.",0
