17	Carel	Mitzi Bickers	Individual	https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/former-city-atlanta-official-indicted-federal-bribery-money-laundering-obstruction-and	"ATLANTA - Mitzi Bickers has been arraigned on 11 federal charges including conspiring to commit bribery, wire fraud, money-laundering, federal obstruction and tax fraud. Bickers was indicted by a federal grand jury on March 27, 2018.

“City of Atlanta contracts always should go to the most qualified bidder through a contracting process that is fair and transparent,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak. “Instead, Mitzi Bickers allegedly conspired to use her influence as a high-ranking City of Atlanta official and later as a connected political consultant to steer lucrative city contracts to Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr., Charles P. Richards, Jr., and their companies through bribery. The illicit arrangement netted over $2 million in bribes for Bickers and almost $17 million in city contracts for Mitchell and Richards, and has shaken the public’s trust in the city’s contracting process.”

“The actions of Bickers, alleged in this indictment, traded the public’s trust in a fair bidding process for personal gain,” said David J. LeValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “The FBI and its partners in law enforcement will not tolerate those who choose to try to influence established and proper government procedures.”

“Public officials need to be reminded of the trust and duty bestowed upon them by the taxpayers to serve the public’s interest not their own,” said Thomas J. Holloman, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation. “When public officials and those seeking to do business with them break this trust by committing fraud, they will be charged to the fullest extent of the law.”

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: As the City of Atlanta’s Director of Human Services and after leaving employment with the city, Bickers allegedly conspired with contractors Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr. and Charles P. Richards, Jr. to accept bribe payments for herself and other public officials in exchange for the her agreement to obtain city contracts for Mitchell’s and Richards’ companies. Both Mitchell and Richards have pleaded guilty to paying bribes to Bickers and are currently serving federal prison sentences for their crimes.

In 2009, Bickers worked on the mayoral campaign and began working for the City of Atlanta after the election. From February 2010 to May 22, 2013, Bickers served as the City of Atlanta’s Director of Human Services. Beginning in 2010, Mitchell and Richards agreed to pay bribes to Bickers to secure profitable City of Atlanta contracts for their businesses. At times, the bribe payments allegedly were referred to as “up-front money.” In reality, Mitchell and Richards often paid Bickers when their companies actually received City of Atlanta contract work.

In exchange for the bribe payments, Bickers promised to represent Mitchell, Richards and their companies on matters relating to City of Atlanta contracting, even though she was a high-level city employee at the time. Bickers also allegedly provided Mitchell and Richards with sensitive contracting information during the critical time when they were bidding on city contracts. Between 2010 and 2013, Mitchell’s and Richard’s companies received multi-million dollar contracts with the city for snow removal, sidewalk repair and maintenance, and bridge reconstruction.

In effort to conceal her relationship with Mitchell and Richards, Bickers allegedly filed numerous false City of Atlanta Financial Disclosure Forms. For example, in 2011, Bickers swore under penalty of perjury that she had no financial relationships with any outside businesses, even though Mitchell’s and Richards’ companies paid her over $650,000 in that year. She used much of this money to purchase a $775,000 lakefront home in Jonesboro, Georgia, making a down payment of over a half million dollars. In that same year, Bickers also allegedly claimed on her taxes that she made only $57,896 as a city employee, resulting in a $3,924 tax refund from the IRS.

In 2013, Bickers’ financial ties to the Pirouette Companies came to light and Bickers resigned her position with the City of Atlanta. After her resignation, Bickers, Mitchell, and Richards allegedly continued the bribery scheme. For example, Bickers helped Mitchell secure a multi-million dollar contract for snow and debris removal work after a snowstorm locked down Atlanta in 2014. In turn, Mitchell paid Bickers and companies associated with her hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. Bickers spent the proceeds of the bribery at stores like Gucci and on expensive vacations, home renovations, four Yamaha WaveRunners, a sports utility vehicle and an ATV. Bickers is also charged with money laundering for purchasing an SUV and four WaveRunners with bribery proceeds from an account held by the Bickers Group, which was her political consulting company.

Ultimately, between 2010 and 2015, Mitchell and Richards allegedly paid Bickers and companies associated with her over $2 million in an attempt get City of Atlanta contracts through bribery. In this same period, the City of Atlanta paid Mitchell’s and Richards’ businesses approximately $17 million for the government contracts they secured.

In September 2015, Mitchell began cooperating with FBI’s investigation into corruption at City Hall. On September 11, 2015 at approximately 5:30 a.m., Shandarrick Barnes threw a concrete block reading “ER, keep your mouth shut!” through a plate glass window in Mitchell’s home. Bickers is alleged to have played a role in this attempt to obstruct the federal investigation. Barnes will be sentenced by District Court Judge Steven C. Jones on April 9, 2018.

Mitzi Bickers, 51, of Atlanta, Georgia, was arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Russell G. Vineyard. Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges. The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

This case is being investigated by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey W. Davis are prosecuting the case.

162	Carel	Geraldine Hill	Individual	https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/operators-california-charity-plead-guilty-mail-fraud-conspiracy-and-tax-evasion	"A California couple pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to commit mail fraud and tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Department’s Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. for the Southern District of California.

According to court documents and statements made in court, married couple Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill operated On Your Feet (OYF), also known as Family Resource Center, a tax-exempt charitable organization whose stated mission was to provide assistance to low income families and individuals in need. From 2011 through 2016, the Hills fraudulently obtained more than $1.35 million in donated clothing and other items by falsely representing to the donors that the items would be given to needy recipients. In fact, the Hills made charitable donations of only about $13,000, sold the remaining donated items, and used the proceeds to financially enrich themselves and others. To conceal their conduct from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Hills filed false charitable tax returns for OYF and false personal tax returns that did not report the income they received from their scheme.

“The Hills not only evaded their taxes, but they did so by abusing their company’s tax-exempt charitable status and thereby cheated not only the public fisc but the donors and intended beneficiaries of the donations,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman. “As the guilty pleas make clear, this conduct will not go unpunished.”

“I am committed to using the resources of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of California to aggressively pursue fraudsters and tax cheats,” said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer Jr. for the Southern District of California. “The conduct by Geraldine and Clayton Hill is particularly offensive because they used the benefits afforded by the 501(c)(3) status of their charity to defraud donors and conceal their profits. By abusing the generosity of companies and individuals who put their faith in the promises made by the Hills, the defendants threatened to undermine the trust and integrity underpinning charitable giving.”

“Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill exploited the public trust and charitable giving by using their charity to solicit over $16 million in goods from hardworking businesses and falsely promising to donate those goods to assist low income families and individuals in need,” said Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. “Instead, the Hills resold the goods and profited over $1.34 million which they spent on vehicles, vacations, and entertainment, as well as personal expenses for their family members. The Hills concealed their fraud by filing false tax returns on behalf of the charity and failing to report their illicit income to the IRS. Their guilty pleas evidence the hard work of IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents to bring to justice those that defraud businesses in the name of charity, and who benefit themselves instead of serving those most in need.”

“While fraud is always wrong, the theft of charitable donations that were to be used to help San Diego’s low income families is particularly disheartening,” said Acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Omer Meisel. “This type of fraud and deceit for personal gain simply cannot be tolerated. The FBI is committed to ensuring that white collar predators don’t prevent those less fortunate from receiving all the benefits that generous donors provide to seemingly legitimate non-profit organizations.”

U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 28, 2020. At sentencing, the Hills face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each mail fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. The Hills also face a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and U.S. Attorney Brewer commended special agents of the IRS-Criminal Investigation Division and the FBI, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorney Valerie Preiss of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Kanter, who are prosecuting the case."

261	Darya	Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador	individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics-drugs-idUSKBN27J2MK	"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday his government would review cooperation over drug policy with the United States and how its agencies operate in Mexico after the recent U.S. arrest of a top military official.

Lopez Obrador’s comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

“We have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,” Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference.

The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. embassy spokeswoman Adrienne Bory said in a statement to Reuters in the Mexican capital that the United States “values its close relationship with Mexico on our shared security challenges.”

“We look forward to continuing our deep and productive relationship — and many future successes,” the statement said.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEA’s historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard expressed dismay at the U.S. failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos.

“We have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President (Donald) Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),” Lopez Obrador said.

“But there are still issues we want to clarify. We’re only waiting for the elections to pass,” he said of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term.

CRIMINAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Sam Waksal

CEO: ImClone
Convicted: October 15, 2002 of securities fraud, bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury
Known for his networking skills as much as for his scientific expertise, immunologist Sam Waksal founded ImClone in 1984. The New York-based biotech firm remained relatively unknown until 1999, when it announced the creation of Erbitux — a cancer-fighting drug so promising it convinced pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers to purchase $1 billion of ImClone stock in one of the largest biotechnology partnerships in U.S. history. But when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug, Waksal alerted several relatives and friends to dump their stock as soon as possible — before the FDA's decision had been made public. Waksal's father and daughter sold $9.2 million worth of ImClone, a move that caught the attention of the SEC and eventually led to his arrest.
Though Waksal pleaded guilty and publicly apologized to his family, his colleagues, and the millions of cancer patients who had held such high hopes for Erbitux, Judge William Pauley dismissed calls for leniency, noting that Waksal had contributed a mere one-half of 1 percent of his $133 million fortune to charity. In the end, the fallen entrepreneur paid $4.3 million in fines and tax restitution, and served 87 months in prison; he was released on Feb. 9, 2009. The scandal's most infamous casualty, however, turned out to be Waksal's pal, Martha Stewart, who had unloaded all 3,928 of her company shares just days before the FDA's decision had been announced to avoid losing an estimated $45,673; the domestic diva got five months in prison as a result."

74	Shakshi	Philippines	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-security-idUSKBN2482SO	"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday told citizens not to fear a new anti-terrorism law, addressing for the first time the controversial legislation that has unnerved rights groups over potential violations of civil liberties.

The mercurial leader last week signed the anti-terrorism bill, prompting rights groups to stage protests and lawyers to question the law before the Supreme Court.

“For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist,” he said in a televised national address mainly to update Filipinos on the coronavirus outbreak.

Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation have nothing to fear, Duterte said, adding that communists are among the terrorists.

The conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party has raged for half a century and killed more than 40,000 people. In the volatile south, the Philippines faces piracy, kidnappings and extremism by groups influenced by Islamic State, who occupied a southern city in 2017 and are now increasingly carrying out suicide bombings.

The new law creates an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president, which can tag individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. It also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Local and international human rights groups had said that while the Philippines does have clear security threats, the legislation could be abused to target administration opponents and suppress peaceful dissent."

178	Karl			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Martos	"Walter Roger Martos Ruiz (born 2 November 1957 [ citation needed ]) is a Peruvian retired military general who briefly served as Prime Minister of Peru from August to November 2020, under Martín Vizcarra 's administration. [1] He previously served as Minister of Defense from October 2019 to August 2020.

A former major-general of the Peruvian Army, Martos served in a variety of leading military positions throughout his career. [2]

Martos was born in the northern city of Cajamarca. [ citation needed ] Following the conclusion of his high school education at the Cristo Rey Maristas School, Martos enrolled in the Chorrillos Military School, where he would graduate in 1978 with a specialization in Engineering. [3] He attained a master's degree at the Army's Superior War College and at the Army's Scientific and Technological Institute. [4]

He was successively Secretary General of the Army General Command; General Commander of Education and Doctrine Command of the Peruvian Army; Commander General of the Northern Military Region (2011); Chief of General Staff of the Army; and Chair of Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces (2013). [4]

He has also been director of the Army Language Center; Academic deputy director and director of the Military School of Chorrillos; director of the School of Engineering and the Superior School of War. [4]

Minister of Defense (2019–2020)[ edit ]

On October 3, 2019, as a retired general, Martos was sworn in as Minister of Defense, as part of the cabinet led by Vicente Zeballos, of the Martín Vizcarra administration. He succeeded retired Vice Admiral Jorge Moscoso in said position, as part of the cabinet renewal following the dissolution of the Peruvian Congress four days prior. [5]

169	Carel	Barack Obama	Individual	https://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/19/politics/stock-act-loophole/index.html	"(CNN) —

It was a rare show of bipartisanship – President Barack Obama, flanked by Democrats and Republicans in April, signing into law a bill that would ban insider trading on Capitol Hill. The measure, known as the STOCK Act, had passed the House and Senate at warp speed.

“The powerful shouldn’t get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else,” the president said at the time.

Lawmakers proclaimed that the bill, officially called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, would restore trust in government. It also applied new rules to some employees of the executive branch.

GSA: $250K spent on one-day event

But CNN uncovered that the law that members of Congress thought they voted for earlier this year isn’t exactly as advertised. A loophole could still allow family members of some lawmakers to profit from inside information.

The STOCK Act requires that any trades of $1,000 or more made on or after July 3 have to be reported to the House and Senate within 45 days. But the House and Senate have two completely different interpretations of that rule.

In the Senate, the Ethics Committee released one page of guidelines last month ruling that members and their spouses and dependent children all have to file reports after they make stock or securities trades. But the House Ethics Committee disagreed.

Its 14-page memo notifies House members and aides covered by the law that their spouses and children aren’t covered. The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees all federal executive branch employees, sided with the House, informing its employees that their spouses and children don’t need to file these periodic reports.

Both of the lead sponsors of the Senate bill didn’t realize the discrepancy until CNN brought it to their attention.

Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown, the only Republican senator to attend the White House signing ceremony, said he was “obviously very concerned.”

“Say I find out some information, I tell my wife and she goes and trades on it, what’s the difference?” Brown told CNN.

Brown, who speaks constantly about this bill in his neck-and-neck race for re-election against consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, said the whole point of passing the law was to demonstrate that members of Congress weren’t held to a different standard.

“I mean, bottom line, we’re supposed to have that level of transparency and have us be treated like every other member of the United States and bottom line, if we can’t do it, then – sorry, if they can’t do it – then we shouldn’t be able to do it as well.”

Why won’t Romney release more tax documents?

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, also criticized the House decision not to include congressional spouses and children.

“I think it’s wrong, and I think it’s unfortunate because the reality is the whole point of this legislation is we should play by the exact same rules as every other American citizen, and when all of America looks at Washington, they know it’s broken.”

“We’re trying to restore just a small measure of confidence through this kind of transparency and accountability,” Gillibrand said.

After CNN told Brown about the House interpretation, Brown fired off a letter to his GOP colleagues in the House, Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

“The House interpretation leaves a loophole and the appearance of an ongoing double standard,” Brown said in the letter.

“It is deeply troubling that the House of Representatives and Executive Branch would attempt to operate under a substantially weaker interpretation than the Senate,” he added, demanding that the House adopt the Senate’s view and require all spouses and dependents to begin reporting stock trades.

Why the difference?

Robert Walker, a Washington ethics attorney and former chief counsel for both the House and Senate Ethics Committees, explained that the Senate bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children, but when Cantor’s office wrote the House version, this language was shifted to a different section of the bill. The change meant that spouses and dependent children weren’t subject to the new reporting requirements.

“The House recrafted some of the provisions of it and moved some of the provisions around. In that process, some of the Senate bill that applied to filing of these new reports was moved from one section of the bill to the other,” Walker said.

The Senate Ethics Committee decided to stick with the spirit of the law that senators originally intended, but the House Ethics Committee went with the letter of the law, which included the loophole not requiring spouses and children to report financial transactions in a timely fashion.

Why does it matter?

This so-called “loophole” goes to the heart of what the STOCK Act set out to do.

While there were already laws in place barring members of Congress or the executive branch from profiting from nonpublic information that they learn in the course of their duties, it was extremely difficult for those at the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce those laws.

The financial disclosure forms House members and senators were already required to file only come out once a year, making it tough to track any relationship between legislative action and a stock trade. That’s why the STOCK Act added the rule that after each trade over $1,000 a report had to be filed in a timely manner.

Walker stressed the new law provides “more immediacy, more real time so that the public could have more real-time understanding of what their members, of their senior staff and other high government officials were doing with their finances, what kinds of trades were they making.”

The chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Alabama, and the ranking Democrat, U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, defended their committee’s interpretation of the law in a written statement to CNN.

“As has been noted by outside experts, the office of Government Ethics and various House offices of expertise, including the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Office of General Counsel, with whom the Committee consulted, the plain language of the STOCK Act and the Ethics in Government Act is unambiguous and beyond dispute and the Committee interpreted it correctly.”

Congressional dysfunction: Who’s to blame?

Initially when contacted by CNN, Cantor’s office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act. But when pressed with the new information uncovered by CNN, the majority leader’s office conceded it made changes to the House bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports.

Cantor’s spokesman maintains the change was inadvertent, but told CNN because of our reporting, they’re now promising to remedy the problem.

“It was not the intention of the House to differ with the Senate-passed bill with respect to application to spouses and dependent children. We did not believe at the time that we had differed from what the Senate had done,” spokesman Doug Heye told CNN.

Heye said after learning from CNN about the difference, they are now looking at ways to fix it.

“Since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy, we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the House of Representatives.”

Still, another question is why the House changed the legislation in the first place. A GOP leadership source insists there were no sinister motives, that Cantor and the broader GOP leadership made changes after consulting with Ethics Committee lawyers.

How they will correct it remains to be seen, but the GOP source says however it’s done, it will be made clear spouses and children of House members and their top aides, as well as the executive branch all carry out the law the way Senate sponsors intended."

370	Carel	Sean Moran	Individual	https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/02/13/arlington-heights-man-gets-2-years-in-prison-for-wire-fraud/	"CHICAGO (CBS) — A northwest suburban man has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for wire fraud.

Sean Moran, 39, pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Sept. 14, 2016, according to FBI spokesman Garrett Croon.

Moran was the owner and president of DCL Capital, Inc., an Arlington-Heights-based trading company, according to federal court documents.

One client invested about $750,000 with DCL Capital, according to the court documents. Moran lied to the investor about his investment of $225,000 made on Nov. 6, 2013, according to court documents. Instead of trading the money, he instead used it for his own expenses, including to pay down substantial credit card debt.

Throughout 2014, Moran lied to the investor and claimed his money was generating positive returns from trading, when instead he knew his trading of the remainder of the investor’s funds had resulted in substantial losses, according to court documents. He prepared and sent several false account statements to the investor, showing that his principal and profit was available and invested, when in reality he had either spent or lost a substantial amount of the funds.

For example, on Dec. 8, 2014, Moran sent the investor a fake statement showing an account balance of $818,900 in principal and a year-to-date profit of $35,753, according to court documents. However, in reality, he only had about $126,000 of the investor’s funds left.

Moran ended up losing about $600,000 of the investor’s money, according to court documents.

Moran, of Arlington Heights, was sentenced to 24 months in prison Thursday by Judge Harry Leinenweber, according to Croon."

265	Wanting	BOS Bank	company	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2D835F	"WARSAW, May 26 (Reuters) - Polish prosecutors have started an investigation into suspected money laundering at a small state-controlled lender BOS Bank, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna daily said on Tuesday, quoting an unnamed source.

The regional prosecutor’s office in Katowice in southern Poland said in an emailed statement to Reuters: “An investigation has been initiated in the local prosecutor’s office regarding irregularities in connection with transactions carried out on bank accounts for selected foreign entities at one of the banks.” The prosecutor’s office did not give further details.

BOS Bank said in a statement on Tuesday that it complies with all anti-money laundering regulations and cooperates with authorities. A BOS Bank spokeswoman declined to comment further.

A spokesman for Poland’s financial sector regulator KNF declined to comment.

BOS Bank shares were down 1.1% by 1213 GMT, underperforming the Polish stock market’s banking index which was up 2.9%

Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has highlighted the country’s success at fighting tax avoidance schemes, but money laundering is rarely a part of public debate.

Poland ranks at 102 out of 125 in a 2019 ranking of countries with highest risk of money laundering compiled by the Basel Institute of Governance. Poland’s ranking indicates that the risk of money laundering in the country is relatively low.

Preventing money laundering has become an increasing focus for regulators in Europe after Estonia became the centre of a major money-laundering scandal in 2017.

The European Union is looking at how to strengthen its scrutiny of the financial sector after a spate of scandals in Estonia, Malta, Latvia, Cyprus and the Netherlands exposed how national watchdogs were slow to take action against banks who abetted or did not prevent money laundering.

51	Sebastien			https://anti-corruption.org/new-undp-publications-on-transparency-accountability-and-anti-corruption-in-covid-19-response-and-recovery/	"UNDP’s Global Anti-Corruption Programme has published two new knowledge products on Integrating Transparency, Accountability and Anti-Corruption in COVID-19 Response and Recovery:

The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health, humanitarian or socio-economic crisis; it is also a governance crisis, testing the resilience of governance institutions and systems to support societies and economies to recover from the ramifications of COVID-19. In particular, corruption and its consequences significantly impact COVID-19 response and recovery. This Guidance Note presents UNDP’s offer in supporting countries to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in both response and recovery priorities.

To build forward better, UNDP’s Next Generation of Anti-Corruption programming aims at strengthening the role of oversight and anti-corruption institutions for sustainable development; promoting social accountability and the role of civil society; strengthening business integrity; and harnessing the benefits of technology and innovation to enhance transparency and openness. These will contribute to all five pillars of the UN’s framework on socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the recognition that effective and accountable governance systems and processes are critical for progressive socio-economic change.

As the technical lead for the socio-economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UN system, UNDP and its COs worldwide are working to assess the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economies and communities to develop and implement effective strategies for COVID-19 response and recovery. Although there is recognition that COVID-19 impacts governance systems, processes and institutions, existing socio-economic impact analyses have not specifically assessed the links between them, and in particular, the impact of corruption and a lack of transparency and accountability on COVID-19 response and recovery. These are largely due to two main challenges: a lack of knowledge and guidance on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in socio-economic impact analysis; and a lack of coordination between anti-corruption institutions and the institutions focusing on socio-economic aspects.

This guidance note thus provides a practical methodology, including checklist questions, on how to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in social and economic needs assessment and response in the context of COVID-19."

325	Sebastien	Gulbuddin Hekmatyar	individual	https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/aging-warlord-gulbuddin-hekmatyar-seeks-comeback-afghanistan-n470301	"KABUL, Afghanistan — One of Afghanistan's most notorious warlords, designated a ""global terrorist"" by the United States and blacklisted by the United Nations along with Osama bin Laden, wants to come out of the shadows.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, now in his late 60s, says he wants a ""real and fair peace"" but with conditions the Kabul government is unlikely to even contemplate, such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and new elections in 2016.

The remarks reflect Hekmatyar's attempt to assert influence and gain new leverage in Afghan politics, but what role — if any — the once-feared warlord could play is unclear.

""Peace can be established and the fighting can end once the occupation is over, foreign forces leave and the people of the Afghan nation are given the right to choose their own destiny and establish their own choice of government and governance,"" Hekmatyar said.

The comments were provided to The Associated Press this week after being videotaped in Hekmatyar's hiding place, presumed to be somewhere in Pakistan, where he moved to after being ejected from Iran following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that removed the Taliban from power. His associates insist, however, that the warlord is in Afghanistan.

Hekmatyar has led an extreme life; his mujahedeen followers have been responsible for the deaths of thousands during the devastating Afghan civil war.

In his student days, he was known for throwing acid in the faces of women who did not cover up. He switched allegiances on the battlefields, fighting first the Soviets, for which he received millions in cash and weaponry from Washington, then the Taliban.

In politics, he espoused radical Islam, served twice as Afghan prime minister and saw Hezb-i-Islami, the party he founded in 1969, fracture and abandon him. The party's military wing offered bin Laden shelter after the al Qaeda leader fled Sudan in 1996, according to the State Department.

But history has relegated Hekmatyar to the sidelines and political analyst Haroun Mir describes him today as a ""spent force, frozen in time.""

The size of any following Hekmatyar could muster is difficult to gauge. The last known attack carried out by his militant group, Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, was in 2013, when at least 15 people, including six American soldiers, were killed in central Kabul.

Afghan security analyst Ali Mohammad Ali says Hekmatyar can no longer run a private army because ""most of his people have joined the Taliban"" or other militant groups, including the emerging ISIS affiliate which has established a presence in Hekmatyar's former strongholds in eastern provinces bordering Pakistan."

404	Dan	Amarinder Singh	Induvidual	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/corruption-is-corruption-capt-to-bajwa/articleshow/77861054.cms	"Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday rejected Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s contention that there was no comparison between the present scholarship scam and the bitumen scam, in which the latter’s name figured 15 years ago.
“Corruption is corruption, in any and every form,” Capt Amarinder asserted.
The bitumen scam allegations against Bajwa, then PWD minister, were as serious as those being levelled in the scholarship scam, he said. Capt Amarinder claimed that had he chosen to behave as irresponsibly then, as Bajwa expected him to now, he would have sacked the then minister on the basis of unsubstantiated charges without a fair probe.
Amarinder said he had decided to assign a detailed and thorough investigation into the alleged scholarship scam to the chief secretary as there was clearly a dispute between the minister concerned and the social welfare department’s additional chief secretary, whose internal report had become the basis of allegations against the minister.
He pointed out that as per the Punjab Rules of Business, 1992, “cases in which there is difference of opinion between the secretary and the minister in charge” shall be submitted to the chief minister through the chief secretary before issuance of orders. Having been a minister himself, Bajwa should have known that this was the only way forward in the the present case, he said and added that he had asked the chief secretary to thoroughly probe the matter before forwarding the case to him for action.
Amarinder also trashed the Aam Aadmi Party’s so-called “rejection” of the chief secretary’s inquiry into the matter, terming it totally absurd and irrational. “Who are they to accept or reject anything?” he said. AAP itself had been rejected by the people of Punjab a long time back, he added."

229	Kristjan	Thomas 'Slab' Murphy	Person	https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-34452981	"The trial of the prominent republican Thomas 'Slab' Murphy at Dublin Special Criminal Court has heard that he had access to considerable cash sums despite not supplying tax returns.

The 66-year-old, from Hackballscross in County Louth, denies failing to furnish tax returns between 1996 and 2004.

The charges arise out of a probe by the Irish police's Criminal Assets Bureau.

The trial is taking place before three judges in a non-jury court and is expected to last three weeks.

Counsel for the state has said that despite Mr Murphy applying for and receiving government grants of more than 100,000 euros (£73,600) he did not make any returns to revenue commissioners.

He said he will show that Mr Murphy had access to considerable cash, more than 300,000 euros (£220,000), for renting land for silage purposes and for dealing with cattle marts.

Grainne Dalton, a retired official from the Irish Department of Agriculture, conceded under cross-examination that she had not personally seen Mr Murphy or any other grant applicant receive or complete forms.

Mr Murphy's lawyer said his client did not accept that he had played any role in submitting grant applications and denied the signatures on the forms were his hand writing.

The presiding judge agreed to a defence request to delay the trial until Thursday to allow them to access disclosure documents."

supplying tax returns, court told
368	Canberk	Jose Huizar	Person	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-30/l-a-councilman-jose-huizar-indicted	"Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar, who was arrested and charged with racketeering last month in an ongoing pay-to-play probe, now faces additional charges including bribery and money laundering, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

The new charges were included in a 34-count grand jury indictment expanding on earlier allegations that Huizar headed up a criminal enterprise that leveraged his power at City Hall for financial gain, aiding real estate developers who handed over bribes including cash, free flights, casino chips and other perks.

The 113-page indictment also includes claims that others conspired with Huizar in the scheme, including a former deputy mayor who previously headed the Department of Building and Safety. Federal prosecutors allege that Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million in illicit financial benefits.

He is the fifth person to be charged in the ongoing investigation, which has netted guilty pleas from former Huizar aide George Esparza, real estate consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim and former Councilman Mitchell Englander.

The indictment alleges that Huizar tried to cover up the illicit money in several ways, including guiding his aide on how to avoid bank reporting requirements and using family members to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. It also alleges that he made false statements to federal prosecutors and the FBI.

Huizar, 51, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Attorneys for the councilman have previously stated that Huizar “intends to respond to the government’s allegations in court.” He is now being represented by attorneys from the federal public defender’s office, one of whom declined to comment Thursday.

Many of the allegations in the indictment were revealed last month in a criminal complaint against the councilman, including that a Chinese billionaire planning a new skyscraper in his downtown district provided $600,000 in collateral to help Huizar quietly settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former aide.

But the document lays out additional details about the alleged crimes. For instance, the criminal complaint alleged that a businessman who wanted Huizar to introduce him to developers paid for gifts including expensive suits, meals and hotel stays for the councilman to meet with a woman with whom he was having an affair.

The indictment, in turn, lays out an itemized list of those alleged gifts with dates and dollar amounts, such as a “suit and shirts” worth $6,000 on June 13, 2016, and “hotel accommodation” worth $1,513.49 on June 19, 2017.

In another instance, the criminal complaint filed in June included allegations that a real estate developer provided political donations as part of a bribery scheme to win approval for an Arts District project. The indictment adds another allegation: that an executive with that development company talked to Huizar about hiring the councilman after he left office.

Federal prosecutors have not named the former deputy mayor allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise, but biographical details included in the indictment and criminal complaint make clear it is Raymond Chan, who has not been arrested or publicly charged in the case.

His attorney, Harland Braun, did not immediately provide comment Thursday but has previously stated that Chan did nothing wrong.

The charges that Huizar faces carry maximum sentences that could stretch for decades, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles. Money laundering, for instance, can be punished by up to 20 years in federal prison, while making false statements to a financial institution carries a maximum sentence of 30 years."

414	Sebastien			https://globalcompliancenews.com/singapore-high-court-sets-out-new-sentencing-framework-for-public-sector-corruption-involving-agents-23072020/	"In brief

In a recent appeal before the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon involving two individuals who had participated in public sector corruption (Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal [2020] SGHC 144), the High Court set out a new sentencing framework for corrupt transactions which take place in relation to contracts with the Government or public bodies under s 6 read with s 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the PCA).

Key takeaways

Public sector corruption (i.e. which relates to the Government or public bodies) is considered an aggravated form of corruption in Singapore because it undermines the integrity of the Government, and erodes the public’s trust and confidence in the various organs and bodies of the State. Given Singapore’s zero-tolerance approach to corruption, custodial sentences are presumptively the norm in cases involving public sector corruption.
The new sentencing framework pertains only to public sector corruption involving agents. The High Court declined to extend the new sentencing framework to cover all corruption offences under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA generally.
The new sentencing framework adopts a five-step analysis (please see below).

In more detail

Background

Wong was the general manager of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) at the material time, and was in charge of AMKTC’s operations, including overseeing and providing input on the selection of contractors for the execution of work. Chia was a shareholder and director of two companies which were in the business of providing construction-related works for various Town Councils in Singapore (the Companies).

From 2014 to 2016, Wong corruptly received and obtained various forms of gratification from Chia (e.g. discounts on a car, remittances to Wong’s mistress, and entertainment expenses). In return, Wong advanced the business interests of the Companies in their dealings with AMKTC by, amongst other things, preferring the tenders submitted by the Companies (even though they were not the lowest), tweaking AMKTC’s tender requirements to suit the Companies’ specifications, and providing input and advice to Chia on the Companies’ bid pricing and technical information.

At trial, both Wong and Chia pleaded guilty to three charges of participating in public sector corruption with an agent under s 6 read with s 7 of the PCA. The Public Prosecutor appealed on the basis that the sentences imposed by the District Judge were inadequate. Wong and Chia cross-appealed on the basis that the sentences imposed were excessive.

Issues

As a common law jurisdiction, the general approach towards sentencing in Singapore has always been to have regard to past cases which have identified a number of categories and factors pertinent to the sentencing process.

However, in respect of corruption cases, past decisions have tended to be of limited relevance given the Public Prosecutor’s discretion to bring charges for the basic corruption offences (under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA) even if the facts could warrant invoking the enhanced punishment provisions (under s 7 of the PCA). This has created two issues for the Singapore courts:

precedents tend to be of limited use; and
even where the facts of previous cases are similar, a high degree of caution is still required as the sentences imposed in those cases may have been under the basic corruption offences.

In the circumstances, a sentencing framework for public sector corruption is warranted so as to provide a consistent and coherent methodology for the courts when dealing with such offences going forward.

The sentencing framework

1. Identify the level of harm caused by the offence and level of culpability, having regard to the list of offence-specific factors. Accordingly, both the level of harm and level of culpability can be broadly classified into three categories scaled according to severity.

* These are non-exhaustive factors

2. Identify the applicable indicative starting range that would apply based on the level of harm and level of culpability determined in Step 1, and the following sentencing matrix:

3. Identify the appropriate indicative starting point within the sentencing range that had been chosen. This entails an examination of the offence-specific factors. This is also where the sentencing court should have regard to the public service rationale, which will typically attract a custodial sentence save for exceptional cases.

4. Make adjustments to the indicative starting point to account for offender-specific factors.

* These are non-exhaustive factors

5. Take into account the totality principle and make final adjustments to the sentence."

Canberk		Singapore: High Court sets out new sentencing framework for public sector corruption involving agents
149	Sebastien	Koch	individual	https://www.mintpressnews.com/koch-brothers-already-accused-of-corruption-in-2014-elections/187760/	"Robert Greenwald, filmmaker and founder of Brave New Films, recently announced a sequel to his 2012 film “ Koch Brothers Exposed.” He said the new film will focus specifically on the duo’s efforts to buy the 2014 election, as well as how detrimental their support for Citizens United has been to the state of democracy in the United States.

While Charles and David Koch remain largely unknown figures to the majority of the American public, with 52 percent recently reporting they have never heard of them, the reality is that the brothers are arguably the most powerful and influential people in Washington — and they’ve never even been elected to office.

Americans may not recognize the men, but they’re probably familiar with the brothers’ business, Koch Industries, and its oil refineries in Alaska, Texas and Minnesota, as well as its products such as Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Stainmaster carpet and Lycra, among others.

Recognizable businesses and brands aside, the public is largely unaware that the Koch brothers are doing everything they can to suppress voter rights, re-segregate public schools, weaken Environmental Protection Agency regulations and privatize Social Security.

As of March 2014, the duo, who are among the richest men in America, have spent at least $30 million this election season to prevent Senate Democrats from being re-elected.

Part of the reason the Koch brothers can spend vast amounts of money but still remain largely unknown public figures is because the Libertarians work to lower personal and corporate taxes, remove social services and limit oversight for industries, especially environmental regulations, through think tanks and generic-sounding advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity.

“The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.”

Puppetmasters

The Koch brothers initiated their influence on U.S. politics by forming and funding think tanks such as the first-ever Libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and electing those who shared their political ideology to local-level positions such as school boards. In recent years, though, the oil barons have used their wealth to influence public policy on a national level.

For example, in the 2000 presidential election campaign, Koch Industries reportedly spent around $900,000 to support George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2004, the Koch brothers-founded group Citizens for a Sound Economy’s Oregon chapter was accused of working to get Ralph Nader on the presidential ballot, in a bid to weaken Democratic support for John Kerry and ensure a re-election for the Bush-Cheney White House.

After Bush was ultimately re-elected, Koch Industries and other fossil fuel companies enjoyed tremendous kickbacks such as the 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton referred to as “the Dick Cheney lobbyist energy bill,” since it provided enormous subsidies and tax breaks to U.S. energy companies.

The Koch brothers also helped Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has been called a test-case and puppet of the Koch brothers, take down unions and their fight for a reasonable wage and collective bargaining, as well as win a special election that was held after the constitutionality of the governor’s actions were questioned. And the brothers currently own the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives.

As they push to take over the Senate and the White House, some Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) are coming forward and asking their colleagues to not let the Koch brothers buy their votes in order to preserve and protect democracy.

“The truth is, the Koch brothers are willing to do anything – even exploit Americans suffering from cancer – to advance their campaign of distortion,” Reid said on the Senate floor in early March. “These two multi-billionaires may spend hundreds of millions of dollars rigging the political process for their own benefit. And they may believe that whoever has the most money gets the most free speech. But I will do whatever it takes to expose their campaign to rig the American political system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

“Republicans are willing to defend the Koch brothers on the floor of the United States Senate. But are they willing to defend the Koch brothers’ radical policy agenda as well? If Republicans don’t support the Koch brothers’ survival of the richest philosophy, all they have to do is say so,” Reid said.

As the Koch brothers have more than enough money to fund an election campaign, some have wondered why they don’t run for office instead of buying and influencing lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in all 50 states. In fact, Charles did convince David to run for office in 1979 as the vice-presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party against Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.

David Koch may have lost the election, but according to Brian Doherty, an editor of the Libertarian magazine Reason and the author of “Radicals for Capitalism,” the experience changed the way the duo looked at politicians. The Koch brothers saw them not as lawmakers, but merely as “actors playing out a script,” and reportedly said they wanted to “supply the themes and words for the scripts.”

How they planned to influence public policy was going to be where policy ideas originate: academia and think tanks.

Abuse of wealth

Though there are several other wealthy individuals in the U.S. who found and fund private organizations, higher education institutions and super PACs, the difference between the Koch brothers and Democratic supporter George Soros, or even Republican supporter Sheldon Adelson, is that the brothers are abusing their wealth to push their self-described radical ideologies that value profit over all else. Donations made by Soros and Adelson are also much less significant than those made by the Koch brothers, raising concerns about the true intent of the Koch brothers’ donations.

Even David Koch has admitted that the family “exerts tight ideological control” over its interests.

“If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,” he told Doherty. “And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding.”

But since the spokespersons for about 45 public and private universities who receive funding from the Koch brothers have continued to deny that the Koch brothers manipulate the curriculum, the Koch brothers’ influence on academia continues to occur without alarming the American public.

Even groups such as Americans for Prosperity are “micromanaged by the Kochs.” That tight control seems to have paid off for the brothers, since during the Obama administration, the president’s public support has dropped to historic lows and his Democratic colleagues have been unseated by Republicans, some of whom are increasingly aligning with Libertarian views.

As the 2014 election season heats up and radical, anti-democratic ideology such as voter ID laws makes its way back into the political realm, the only thing the American public can be sure of is that the Koch brothers are not only funding smear campaigns against politicians whose political ideologies do not help their bottom line, but they are also funding the campaigns of Republican politicians who are pro-big-oil, pro-Wall Street and pro-segregation.

Since the Koch brothers have been successful in manipulating the American political system for a number of decades, even though they hide in the shadows, it’s more important than ever to look at who is funding the think tanks and higher education institutions the media enlists this election season to explain the policies that are at the center of the political debate and will ultimately affect us all.

If we fail to pay attention now, it’s evident from the Koch brothers’ record that only a few of us will continue to be allowed to actively participate in our democracy."

and brands aside, the public is largely unaware that the Koch brothers are doing everything they can to suppress voter rights, re-segregate public schools, weaken Environmental Protection Agency regulations and privatize Social Security.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">As of March 2014, the duo, who are among the richest men in America, have spent at least <a href=""http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/03/25/charles-david-koch-battleground-poll-americans-for-prosperity/"">$30 million</a> this election season to prevent Senate Democrats from being re-elected.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">Part of the reason the Koch brothers can spend vast amounts of money but still remain largely unknown public figures is because the Libertarians work to lower personal and corporate taxes, remove social services and limit oversight for industries, especially environmental regulations, through think tanks and generic-sounding advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">“The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money,” <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all"">said</a> Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.”</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Puppetmasters</strong></h2>\n<p dir=""ltr"">The Koch brothers initiated their influence on U.S. politics by forming and funding think tanks such as the first-ever Libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and electing those who shared their political ideology to local-level positions such as school boards. In recent years, though, the oil barons have used their wealth to influence public policy on a national level.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">For example, in the 2000 presidential election campaign, Koch Industries <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all"">reportedly</a> spent around $900,000 to support George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2004, the Koch brothers-founded group Citizens for a Sound Economy’s Oregon chapter was accused of working to get Ralph Nader on the presidential ballot, in a bid to weaken Democratic support for John Kerry and ensure a re-election for the Bush-Cheney White House.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">After Bush was ultimately re-elected, Koch Industries and other fossil fuel companies enjoyed tremendous kickbacks such as the 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton referred to as “the Dick Cheney lobbyist energy bill,” since it provided enormous subsidies and tax breaks to U.S. energy companies.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">The Koch brothers also helped Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has been called a test-case and puppet of the Koch brothers, take down unions and their fight for a reasonable wage and collective bargaining, as well as win a special election that was held after the constitutionality of the governor’s actions were questioned. And the brothers currently own the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">As they push to take over the Senate and the White House, some Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) are coming forward and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=8k3hgSi_MAM"">asking their colleagues</a> to not let the Koch brothers buy their votes in order to preserve and protect democracy.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">“The truth is, the Koch brothers are willing to do anything – even exploit Americans suffering from cancer – to advance their campaign of distortion,” Reid said on the Senate floor in early March. “These two multi-billionaires may spend hundreds of millions of dollars <a href=""http://www.reid.senate.gov/koch-facts#.UzWzSFdYMRr"">rigging the political process</a> for their own benefit. And they may believe that whoever has the most money gets the most free speech. But I will do whatever it takes to expose their campaign to rig the American political system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">“Republicans are willing to defend the Koch brothers on the floor of the United States Senate. But are they willing to defend the Koch brothers’ radical policy agenda as well? If Republicans don’t support the Koch brothers’ survival of the richest philosophy, all they have to do is say so,” Reid said.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">As the Koch brothers have more than enough money to fund an election campaign, some have wondered why they don’t run for office instead of buying and influencing lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in all 50 states. In fact, Charles did convince David to run for office in 1979 as the vice-presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party against Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">David Koch may have lost the election, but according to Brian Doherty, an editor of the Libertarian magazine Reason and the author of “Radicals for Capitalism,” the experience changed the way the duo looked at politicians. The Koch brothers saw them not as lawmakers, but merely as “actors playing out a script,” and <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all"">reportedly</a> said they wanted to “supply the themes and words for the scripts.”</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">How they planned to influence public policy was going to be where policy ideas originate: academia and think tanks.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>Abuse of wealth</strong></h2>\n<p dir=""ltr"">Though there are several other wealthy individuals in the U.S. who found and fund private organizations, higher education institutions and super PACs, the difference between the Koch brothers and Democratic supporter George Soros, or even Republican supporter Sheldon Adelson, is that the brothers are abusing their wealth to push their self-described radical ideologies that value profit over all else. Donations made by Soros and Adelson are also <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/education/Inside_the_Koch_brothers_campus_crusade.html"">much less significant</a> than those made by the Koch brothers, raising concerns about the true intent of the Koch brothers’ donations.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">Even David Koch has admitted that the family “exerts tight ideological control” over its interests.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">“If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,” he <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all"">told</a> Doherty. “And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding.”</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">But since the spokespersons for about 45 public and private universities who receive funding from the Koch brothers have <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/education/Inside_the_Koch_brothers_campus_crusade.html"">continued to deny</a> that the Koch brothers manipulate the curriculum, the Koch brothers’ influence on academia continues to occur without alarming the American public.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">Even groups such as Americans for Prosperity are “micromanaged by the Kochs.” That tight control seems to have paid off for the brothers, since during the Obama administration, the president’s public support has dropped to historic lows and his Democratic colleagues have been unseated by Republicans, some of whom are increasingly aligning with Libertarian views.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">As the 2014 election season heats up and radical, anti-democratic ideology such as voter ID laws makes its way back into the political realm, the only thing the American public can be sure of is that the Koch brothers are not only funding smear campaigns against politicians whose political ideologies do not help their bottom line, but they are also funding the campaigns of Republican politicians who are pro-big-oil, pro-Wall Street and pro-segregation.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">Since the Koch brothers have been successful in manipulating the American political system for a number of decades, even though they hide in the shadows, it’s more important than ever to look at who is funding the think tanks and higher education institutions the media enlists this election season to explain the policies that are at the center of the political debate and will ultimately affect us all.</p>\n<p dir=""ltr"">If we fail to pay attention now, it’s evident from the Koch brothers’ record that only a few of us will continue to be allowed to actively participate in our democracy.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n\n</div>        ',

369	Darya	Jon Wiggett	individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-54241676	"The owner of a Highland golf course has been jailed over a £154,000 tax fraud.

Jon Wiggett submitted 13 false VAT repayment claims over a three-year period, and tried to back up the fraud with dozens of fake purchase receipts for the Brahan Golf Club.

The 51-year-old from Conon Bridge, near Dingwall, made the claims between 2014 and 2017.

At Inverness Sheriff Court, Wiggett, who had earlier pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 15 months in jail.

An HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) investigation found that he presented the fake invoices as proof for buying a lawn mower, hundreds of bottles of herbicide and sand mixture for his club.

175	Sebastien	Odebrecht	company	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/11/brazils-corruption-scandal-spreads-across-south-america	"The fallout from a massive bribery scandal that helped to bring down a Brazilian president is spreading across Latin America, threatening to engulf leaders from Panama to Peru.

The workings of a secret “bribery department” at the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht that suborned government officials around the world for years are being exposed by investigators. Meticulous schemes of graft laid out by witnesses, in plea deals and in leaked and seized documents show how the company funnelled $800m (£641m) of payouts to politicians and parties in Latin America alone.

As prosecutors chase the trail of that cash, it has led them towards some of the region’s most prominent figures. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, was accused in leaked testimony last year of taking campaign funds from Odebrecht, and the Panamanian president, Juan Carlos Varela, was implicated by a man who has himself been arrested in connection with the scandal. Both deny wrongdoing. In Argentina a federal judge is seeking information from Brazil and Switzerland to determine if the head of the spy agency took a $600,000 bribe from Odebrecht, which he also denies.

But perhaps the most surprising accusations came this week, when authorities implicated two men who have based their political careers on a reputation for integrity in countries plagued by graft. Peru sent out an Interpol arrest warrant for its former president Alejandro Toledo, on charges of taking some $20m in bribes. And Colombia’s chief prosecutor has said the country’s Nobel peace prize-winning president Juan Manuel Santos may have taken money for his re-election campaign. Both men have strongly denied the charges.

Toledo, who led Peru from 2001 to 2006, rose to power leading protests against the former president Alberto Fujimori, who was later jailed for corruption and human rights abuses. The country is still reeling from the news that Toledo could be joining his old opponent in prison. The front page of the local newspaper El Comercio reproached the former president, who comes from an indigenous family, with a headline quoting a traditional Andean commandment, “Ama Sua: do not steal”.

Authorities who offered a $30,000 reward for Toledo’s capture say he took the money in return for smoothing Odebrecht’s path to a lucrative contract for a road connecting Brazil to Peru’s Pacific coast. They have sought particular help from the US, where Toledo is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, and from Israel. His wife has Israeli citizenship and the country does not have an extradition treaty with Peru, so officials fear he may try to seek refuge there.

Santos has been accused by Colombia’s chief prosecutor Nestor Martinez of taking up to $1m in campaign donations, based on the testimony of an ex-senator who was jailed for allegedly channelling Odebrecht cash but also has ties to Santos’s opponents. Martinez plans to travel to Brazil this week to look for evidence to support the accusation, Reuters reported. Santos has rejected the allegations, but the case could be particularly damaging to a leader who took a fierce public stance on the unfolding scandal.

He threatened last month that the “full weight of the law” would fall on anyone accused of taking Odebrecht cash, and his government was the first outside Brazil to arrest former officials after the firm admitted a history of corruption in a plea deal with the US justice department. Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5bn in penalties to authorities in Switzerland, the US and Brazil to settle the case. However, many in Latin America and beyond believe that agreement could mark just the beginning of efforts to unravel a complex and entrenched network of corruption. US prosecutors, when they announced the deal, described an extraordinary normalisation of graft within the firm, that suggested few countries where it operated would have been immune.

“[They] used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit – a ‘Department of Bribery’, so to speak – that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,” said the US deputy assistant attorney general Sung-Hee Suh.

Many more details about the system and the people who benefited from it are thought to be laid out in testimony from former top executives at Odebrecht, nicknamed the “end of the world confessions” by local media. They form a key part of plea deals made by 77 senior executives from the company and its former boss Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the founder.

They have not been made public, but few people in Brazil expect their explosive contents to stay secret forever, and a single confession leaked so far implicates the deeply unpopular Temer in taking a multimillion-pound campaign donation from the group.

He denies taking the money, but is now the second Brazilian leader whose future has been jeopardised by the firm’s corruption. It was part of the wider Car Wash scandal that was a major driver in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff last year, although she was ousted for breaking budget laws and has not been personally implicated.

In Panama the unfolding scandal has caught up both the president and his accuser Ramón Fonseca, a former friend and one of the founders of the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal, Fonseca himself was arrested along with his business partner Juergen Mossack as part of an inquiry into his connections with Odebrecht shortly after insisting that Varela had taken campaign money from the group.

“He [Varela] told me that he had accepted donations from Odebrecht because he could not fight with everyone,” Fonseca said, without giving more details. Varela denied receiving funds and promised to make all donations to his political campaign public."

In Argentina a federal judge is seeking information from Brazil and Switzerland to determine if the head of the spy agency took a $600,000 bribe from Odebrecht, which he also denies.</p>\n\n<p>But perhaps the most surprising accusations came this week, when authorities implicated two men who have based their political careers on a reputation for integrity in countries plagued by graft. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/peru-ex-president-alejandro-toledo-faces-arrest-on-bribery-charges"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Peru sent out an Interpol arrest warrant for its former president Alejandro Toledo</a>, on charges of taking some $20m in bribes. And Colombia’s chief prosecutor has said the country’s Nobel peace prize-winning president Juan Manuel Santos may have taken money for his re-election campaign. Both men have strongly denied the charges.</p>\n\n<p>Toledo, who led Peru from 2001 to 2006, rose to power leading protests against the former president <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/07/alberto-fujimori-peru"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Alberto Fujimori, who was later jailed for corruption and human rights abuses</a>. The country is still reeling from the news that Toledo could be joining his old opponent in prison. The front page of the local newspaper <em>El Comercio</em> reproached the former president, who comes from an indigenous family, with a headline quoting a traditional Andean commandment, “Ama Sua: do not steal”.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities who offered a $30,000 reward for Toledo’s capture say he took the money in return for smoothing Odebrecht’s path to a lucrative contract for a road connecting Brazil to Peru’s Pacific coast. They have sought particular help from the US, where Toledo is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, and from Israel. His wife has Israeli citizenship and the country does not have an extradition treaty with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/peru"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Peru</a>, so officials fear he may try to seek refuge there.</p>\n\n<p>Santos has been accused by Colombia’s chief prosecutor Nestor Martinez of taking up to $1m in campaign donations, based on the testimony of an ex-senator who was jailed for allegedly channelling Odebrecht cash but also has ties to Santos’s opponents. Martinez plans to travel to Brazil this week to look for evidence to support the accusation, Reuters reported. Santos has rejected the allegations, but the case could be particularly damaging to a leader who took a fierce public stance on the unfolding scandal.</p>\n\n<p>He threatened last month that the “full weight of the law” would fall on anyone accused of taking Odebrecht cash, and his government was the first outside Brazil to arrest former officials after the firm admitted a history of corruption in a plea deal with the US justice department. <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/odebrecht-and-braskem-plead-guilty-and-agree-pay-least-35-billion-global-penalties-resolve"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5bn in penalties to authorities in Switzerland, the US and Brazil </a>to settle the case. However, many in Latin America and beyond believe that agreement could mark just the beginning of efforts to unravel a complex and entrenched network of corruption. US prosecutors, when they announced the deal, described an extraordinary normalisation of graft within the firm, that suggested few countries where it operated would have been immune.</p>\n\n<p>“[They] used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit – a ‘Department of Bribery’, so to speak – that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,” said the US deputy assistant attorney general Sung-Hee Suh.</p>\n\n<p>Many more details about the system and the people who benefited from it are thought to be laid out in testimony from former top executives at Odebrecht, nicknamed the “end of the world confessions” by local media. They form a key part of plea deals made by 77 senior executives from the company and its former boss Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the founder.</p>\n\n<p>They have not been made public, but few people in Brazil expect their explosive contents to stay secret forever, and a single confession leaked so far implicates the deeply unpopular Temer in taking a multimillion-pound campaign donation from the group.</p>\n\n<p>He denies taking the money, but is now the second Brazilian leader whose future has been jeopardised by the firm’s corruption. It was part of the wider <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeachment-brazil-what-you-need-to-know"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Car Wash scandal that was a major driver in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff</a> last year, although she was ousted for breaking budget laws and has not been personally implicated.</p>\n\n<p>In Panama the unfolding scandal has caught up both the president and his accuser Ramón Fonseca, a former friend and one of the founders of the law firm at the centre of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Panama Papers scandal</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/panama-papers-mossack-fonseca-offices-raided-over-odebrecht-bribery-scandal"" data-link-name=""in body link"">Fonseca himself was arrested along with his business partner Juergen Mossack</a> as part of an inquiry into his connections with Odebrecht shortly after insisting that Varela had taken campaign money from the group.</p>\n\n<p>“He [Varela] told me that he had accepted donations from Odebrecht because he could not fight with everyone,” Fonseca said, without giving more details.

		Tech mogul Robert Brockman has been charged in a $2 billion tax evasion case, the biggest in US history, the Justice Department said Thursday.
		Brockman hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
		He was charged after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said.
		Brockman faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.

Houston technology executive Robert Brockman has been charged in the biggest-ever tax evasion case against a US citizen, after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said on Thursday.
Brockman, the 79-year-old chief executive of Ohio-based Reynolds and Reynolds Co, hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, using a web of off-shore companies in Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
Reynolds and Reynolds provides software used by auto dealerships to help manage their business.
The indictment alleges Brockman appointed nominees to manage the off-shore entities for him as a means of hiding his involvement, saying he even went so far as to establish a proprietary encrypted email system and use code words such as ""Permit,"" ""Red fish,"" and ""Snapper"" to communicate.
At a press conference in San Francisco, US Attorney David Anderson said Brockman was also charged in a securities fraud scheme, after he bought and sold debt securities in his own company, ""breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt.""
The debt was purchased thanks to inside information Brockman possessed, Anderson added.
He faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and numerous other counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.
""Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,"" Brockman's attorney Kathryn Keneally said in an emailed statement.
A spokesman for Smith, who founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Anderson said Smith, who helped secure the charges against Brockman and famously announced at last year's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the tax evasion scheme.
Brockman and Smith have a business relationship dating back to the late 1990s, according to documents filed in connection with Smith's non-prosecution agreement.
Brockman, who is referred to as ""Individual A,"" became an investor in Smith's private equity fund in 2000, first with a $300 million commitment, and later increasing it to $1 billion.
As part of his non-prosecution agreement, Smith admitted to using a nominee trustee and corporate manager to hide his control in four off-shore companies. Some of his untaxed income was used to buy a vacation home in Sonoma, California, and ski properties in the Alps, and to fund charitable causes, Anderson said.
He will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, and will abandon a $182 protective refund claim and pay interest as part of the deal.
""Although Smith willfully and knowingly violated the law, Smith has accepted responsibility and agreed to provide complete and truthful cooperation,"" Anderson said.
Smith founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners and he is listed by Forbes as being the nation's wealthiest Black investor."

A subsidiary of Japanese synthetic fibre-maker Toray falsified product data, the company has admitted.

It is the latest in a series of Japanese corporate scandals in which major corporations have admitted to lapses in quality control.

Toray Hybrid Cord re-wrote quality tests before shipping products to 13 companies, including tyre makers and car parts makers.

Shares in Toray fell 8% on the news before recovering slightly.

Recurring theme

Toray is the latest in a string of Japanese companies that have admitted to lapses in quality control.

In October, Kobe Steel said it falsified strength and quality data for products shipped to hundreds of clients.

Nissan recalled 1.2 million vehicles after admitting in October that staff without proper authorisation had conducted final inspections on some vehicles intended for the domestic market. Subaru also recalled nearly 400,000 vehicles for similar reasons.

Last week, Mitsubishi Material also admitted that its subsidiaries falsified product data.

'Deeply apologise'

In Tokyo on Tuesday, Toray president Akihiro Nikkaku apologised while taking a deep bow, a gesture of contrition common at press conferences for Japanese companies affected by scandal.

""We deeply apologise for causing troubles and concerns,"" he said.

He admitted Toray Hybrid Cord had discovered 149 cases of falsifying data between 2008 and 2016, but said there were no safety issues or breaches of the law.

He told the news conference Toray only decided to go public with the cheating admissions in the wake of a similar scandal at Kobe Steel, and after it leaked online.

""We hadn't planned on disclosing it,"" he said.

The company said that the data falsification occurred only at the subsidiary, and did not affect Toray's main carbon-fibre business.

422	Sebastien	Andrade Gutierrez	Organization	https://www.riskadvisory.com/news/brazilian-infrastructure-and-corruption/	Four years ago, Rio de Janeiro made history by becoming the first city in South America to win a bid to host the Summer Olympics, to be held in 2016. Two years earlier, and to even more fanfare, Brazil won the bid to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the first to be held in South America since 1978. These accomplishments were seen as a sign of Brazil’s growing economic and political importance on the world stage. At the time, then-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told reporters, ‘I’ve never felt more pride in Brazil. Now, we are going to show the world we can be a great country.’ However, the attention surrounding the two sporting events has also shone a light on two major shortcomings that anyone who lives or works in Brazil is painfully aware of: infrastructure and corruption. Expanding infrastructure The World Cup and Olympics will attract a flood of both domestic and international visitors (3.6 million to the World Cup, according to FIFA). These visitors will arrive in and depart from Brazil’s major airports, ride its metro systems and take its buses to attend games at its stadiums. Unfortunately, at present, Brazil’s airports are old and running at capacity. Taking a bus in Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo can involve sitting in traffic for hours on end. Furthermore, Brazil’s infrastructure requirements go much further than a need to ferry spectators and athletes to and from sporting events. The highways, railroads and ports that transport the commodities that power Brazil’s economic growth are also inadequate and overwhelmed. The challenge to update Brazil’s infrastructure was clear when it won the bids to host the Olympics and the World Cup, and the government has responded in kind. Over the past six years, it has poured billions of dollars into upgrading infrastructure. The government’s own projections state that overall infrastructure investment reached $100 billion in 2012 and will more than double over the coming years. New investments announced last year under the Growth Acceleration Program of Investment (PAC), a government plan for infrastructure investment started under the last presidential administration, will include the construction of 6,000 miles of new railways and 4,500 miles of new roads in the coming years. Corruption and infrastructure Against this backdrop, the potential rewards for companies in the construction, engineering and infrastructure sectors are clear. Unfortunately, the large sums being spent and the involvement of government officials and entities create a fertile breeding ground for corruption. As in many developing countries, corruption and infrastructure investment go hand in hand in Brazil. A 2011 study by Professor Marcos Fernandes da Silva at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a renowned Brazilian university, found that Brazil had lost R$40 billion (approximately $18 billion) to corruption between 2002 and 2008	 much of this loss was attributed to the infrastructure sector. Another study by FIESP, a São Paulo-based industrial association, estimated that with the money lost to corruption in the first stage of the PAC (between 2007 and 2010) 124 percent more roads and 525 percent more railways could have been built. In keeping with the scale of the problem, several of Brazil’s largest corruption scandals involving the private sector have been connected to the infrastructure industry. Almost every major Brazilian construction and engineering company – including the top four, Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Corrêa, Odebrecht and Queiroz Galvão – has been accused of, or investigated for, some sort of irregularity in connection to a government tender. Smaller firms have also been implicated in corruption schemes. One of the more prominent corruption scandals of the 2000s involved a construction company called Construtora Gautama, which, despite having signed various construction contracts with local governments in north-eastern Brazil, did not have a single engineer on its payroll. Six years later, Gautama’s owner, Zuleido Veras, along with an ex-governor of Alagoas, was convicted in an Alagoas court of diverting funds from an urban drainage project. However, a larger related federal case has only just been opened. Such incidents, though, seldom lead to prison time. The Brazilian justice system is notoriously slow and lawyers can easily draw out a judgement for years, often past the statute of limitations. Matthew Taylor, a professor at American University specializing in corruption in Brazil, explained to us that delays in the courts make it difficult to remove corrupt players in an efficient way. As a result, unethical companies and government officials are rarely punished for engaging in corrupt practices. The corruption playbook Most corruption in the Brazilian infrastructure sector takes place between private construction and engineering companies and the government officials who contract them to carry out infrastructure projects. Governmental authorities are meant to hold tenders to choose, among qualified bidders, the company that can provide its services at the lowest cost. However, companies can circumvent this requirement by paying the officials bribes in exchange for favourable treatment in the tender. In a recent textbook case, Brazil’s Comptroller General found that Delta Construções, a construction company based in Rio de Janeiro, had showered state employees responsible for approving highway contracts in Ceará state in northern Brazil with gifts such as airline tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, meals and fuel. Delta was subsequently blacklisted from government contracts and dropped out of the consortium participating in the renovation of Rio de Janeiro’s iconic Maracanã football stadium. Companies also pay bribes so that government officials will turn a blind eye to violations of tender rules though in many cases only the tender violations come to light. For example, in one case, Brazil’s public prosecutor’s office filed charges against several of Brazil’s largest construction companies including Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Corrêa, Mendes Júnior, OAS, and Queiroz Galvão, accusing them of rigging a R$4 billion (more than $2.34 billion at the time) tender for expansion of a subway line in São Paulo. The Folha de São Paulo, a major Brazilian newspaper, had reportedly obtained the results of the tender a few days before it was suspended in April 2010. The São Paulo Metro had the participants re-submit their bids, supposedly due to price issues. Six months later it announced results identical to those reported by the Folha de São Paulo, sparking suspicions that the winners had been agreed upon among the competing companies before the tender. While Brazil’s competition authority ruled that they had not formed a cartel, the companies remain defendants in a related civil case in São Paulo. Some commentators have questioned the political donations made by large construction companies, as well as their political links. For example, Delta’s owner, Fernando Cavendish, is reported to be a close friend of the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Sérgio Cabral. Furthermore, according to the local media, six of the top 10 corporate political contributors are in the construction business: Andrade Gutierrez, OAS, Queiroz Galvão, Cristiani-Nielsen, Odebrecht, Carvalho Hoskent and Camargo Corrêa. A study by academics from Boston University and the University of California found that government contractors received R$8.50 for every real donated to candidates from the ruling Workers’ Party elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2006, ‘although total return on investment might well be higher over the [candidate’s] full four-year term’. While these donations are all legal (and it is not a crime to be friends with a governor), some commentators have questioned the ethics of such a close relationship between construction companies and the government that gives them so much of their work. A changing tide? Although corruption is a recognised part of life for many Brazilians, recent protests across the country have highlighted a growing discontent with the current state of affairs. Protests began in June in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, ostensibly in reaction to an increase in public transportation fares. The unrest quickly escalated, though, with members of an increasingly large and vocal middle class calling for a change in government priorities. Desirous of a national government that addresses social, as much as economic, development, many protesters questioned the government’s investment in stadiums when education and health systems are still wanting. Many protestors were pictured in the media carrying placards in English urging visitors not to attend the World Cup. In an effort to help quell the unrest, Brazil’s president recently signed into law a long-delayed anti-corruption bill (it was first introduced in 2010), which is expected to come into force in early 2014. The new law introduces, for the first time, corporate liability into Brazilian anti-corruption law and addresses offenses committed by Brazilian companies outside the country. It is not clear what effect this new law will have. Corruption does not thrive in Brazil because there are no laws to address it but, rather, because the country’s institutions are unable or unwilling to enforce them. It is not clear at this stage, for example, which Brazilian federal and state agencies will take the lead in enforcing the new law. What the law does do, however, is underline the need for companies from jurisdictions with more robust anti-corruption enforcement to undertake proper due diligence before entering the Brazilian market. Companies that wish to operate in Brazil’s infrastructure sector and to partner with local companies need to understand who their partners are – including their reputation and political connections. If Brazil is to capitalise fully on the opportunities afforded it by hosting two of the biggest international sporting events in the next three years, and if it wishes to continue down its promising development path, it must ensure that its infrastructure investments are not tainted by the corrupt practices of the past.

359	Canberk	David W. Delainey	Person	https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/former-enron-executive-david-delainey-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading	"Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Leslie R. Caldwell, and Assistant Director Grant Ashley of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division announced today that David W. Delainey, former chief executive officer of Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, has pleaded guilty to insider trading.

Delainey, 37, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Kenneth Hoyt at U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Delainey pleaded guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with insider trading, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 78ff and 78j(b). As part of his plea agreement, Delainey has agreed to cooperate fully with the government's ongoing criminal investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation.

Delainey faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million at his sentencing, which will be scheduled at a later date. Delainey has agreed to forfeit all interest in more than $4.25 million in net proceeds from the offense to which he is pleading guilty.

""Today's guilty plea shows that the tireless work of the Enron Task Force is continuing to hold accountable those who participated in the massive fraud at Enron,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division. ""At the same time, securing the cooperation of the CEO of a major Enron business unit is an important step forward in the thorough and continuing investigation of this sophisticated corporate fraud.""

As described in the indictment and plea agreement, Delainey knew of and participated in aspects of a scheme by Enron's senior managers from at least 1998 through late 2001 to deceive the investing public about the nature and profitability of Enron's businesses and thereby to inflate the share price of Enron's stock. Delainey admitted that the fraudulent scheme included the improper reserving of hundreds of millions of dollars of unreported earnings to hide volatility in Enron's earnings and improperly set aside earnings for later use; the use of excess profits generated in one business unit's California energy trading to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of losses in another business unit; the manufacturing of earnings through fraudulent over-valuation of assets; and the structuring of financial transactions using improper accounting techniques in order to meet budget and earnings targets set by top Enron management.

Delainey further admitted that based on material non-public information in his possession, including Enron's fraudulent accounting schemes, he sold Enron stock for net proceeds totaling $4,256,006.67 at various times between January 10, 2000 and January 11, 2001.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigations Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. The Task Force investigation is continuing."

201	Sebastien	bukola saraki	individual	https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/2019-election-7-corruption-allegations-that-will-frustrate-sarakis-presidential/7337dm6	"The All Progressives Congress (APC) has made a list of several corruption allegations it says will frustrate Senate President Bukola Sarakis presidential ambition in 2019.

According to Vanguard, the ruling party said that the Senate President will not pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.

This was made known to newsmen by the APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, in a statement which he issued on Monday, August 20, 2018, according to Daily Post.

Saraki, in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, August 15, 2018, said that he's considering the possibility of running for the office of president against President Buhari in the 2019 presidential election.

See the 7 corruption allegations reproduced below:

1. N1b allegedly looted from Société Générale Bank

“In a recent interview with the international news organization, Bloomberg, the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki unsurprisingly declared his intention to contest the 2019 Presidency under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

“Against the backdrop of the litany of corruption allegations trailing the Senate President, Saraki’s declaration, brings to the fore our earlier call to anti-graft agencies to check the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in this country. We reiterate our position that the Nigerian electorate must have the opportunity to choose from candidates that can pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.

“Let us refresh our memory on some of Saraki’s corruption allegations: Allegations of fraud which led to the collapse of the Saraki family-owned Société Générale Bank (Bukola Saraki who was Director of the defunct bank was indicted over N1bn alleged to have been looted from the bank’s treasury).”

2. Mis-appropriation of Kwara State funds

“Misappropriation of Kwara State funds, disregard of government due process and conversion of State government assets into his and cronies when he served as two-term governor of Kwara State.

“History of betrayals, treachery and sabotage – Family, political party (PDP, APC), Senate, government.”

3. N11b financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank

The APC spokesman said “Saraki was questioned by the Nigeria Police Special Fraud Unit over an N11 billion financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank.”

4. Hidden Panama funds.

According to Nabena, the Senate President's desire to acquire for property is 'Gluttonous '.

“Gluttonous property acquisitions and hidden multi-billion dollar assets spread across the world as disclosed by the Panama Papers revelations.”

5. Shonga Agricultural Project.

Nabena also mentioned a “multi-million dollar white elephant Shonga Agricultural Project in Kwara State when Saraki served as two-term governor.”

6. Falsification of Senate Order

The APC spokesman accused Saraki of “Falsification of Senate standing order""

""Saraki’s link to the N298m armoured Range Rover SUV seized by the Nigeria Customs Service.”

7. $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal

“Saraki is link to $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal, he oversaw budget padding in the National Assembly among other numerous corruption scandals,” Nabena added.

APC warns Nigerians

The party also warned Nigerians to be wary of Saraki, who it says will always put himself over National interest.

“Nigerians should be wary of a man whose personal ambition will always supersede the interest of the majority and national interest as currently displayed in the National Assembly.

“While Saraki refuses to reconvene the National Assembly, the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is dangerously delayed, an action deliberately taken to sabotage INEC’s ability to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2019.

“While Saraki refuses to step down as Senate President as rightly and severally demanded by the APC-dominated Senate, he is bent on foisting a PDP-minority rule (Senate President and Deputy Senate President) in the Upper Legislative House,” the statement added.

Saraki's way

Nabena, in the statement, also said Saraki only knows how to play politics that will benefit him alone.

He said “The only politics that Bukola Saraki plays is self, himself only and only himself. The interest and welfare of the people of Nigeria do not mean anything to him. Now it is the Presidency Saraki wants.

“And we ask with what antecedents is he doing this? Conspiracy, blackmail, treachery and vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other, as rightly captured by William Shakespeare. Bukola Saraki will rather rule in hell than serve in paradise.

“Ahead of 2019 elections, Nigerians must ensure that we never again entrust the leadership of this great country to thieves whose sole aim is treasury looting and returning us to the dark ages where impunity and institutionalized corruption was the order of the day.”

Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu hassaid that Saraki and the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal left the APC because the party could not offer them what they wanted.

Tinubu said those who defected wanted automatic tickets and also to share Nigeria’s money, which the ruling party could not guarantee."

N1b allegedly looted from Société Générale Bank</p>\n\n<p>“In a recent interview with the international news organization, Bloomberg, the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki unsurprisingly declared his intention to contest the 2019 Presidency under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>\n\n<p>“Against the backdrop of the litany of corruption allegations trailing the Senate President, Saraki’s declaration, brings to the fore our earlier call to anti-graft agencies to check the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in this country. We reiterate our position that the Nigerian electorate must have the opportunity to choose from candidates that can pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.</p>\n\n<p>“Let us refresh our memory on some of Saraki’s corruption allegations: Allegations of fraud which led to the collapse of the Saraki family-owned Société Générale Bank (Bukola Saraki who was Director of the defunct bank was indicted over N1bn alleged to have been looted from the bank’s treasury).”</p>\n\n<p>2. Mis-appropriation of Kwara State funds</p>\n\n<p>“Misappropriation of Kwara State funds, disregard of government due process and conversion of State government assets into his and cronies when he served as two-term governor of Kwara State.</p>\n\n<p>“History of betrayals, treachery and sabotage – Family, political party (PDP, APC), Senate, government.”</p>\n\n<p>3. N11b financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank</p>\n\n<p>The APC spokesman said “Saraki was questioned by the Nigeria Police Special Fraud Unit over an N11 billion financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank.”</p>\n\n<p>4. Hidden Panama funds.</p>\n\n<p>According to Nabena, the Senate President\'s desire to acquire for property is \'Gluttonous \'.</p>\n\n<p>“Gluttonous property acquisitions and hidden multi-billion dollar assets spread across the world as disclosed by the Panama Papers revelations.”</p>\n\n<p>5. Shonga Agricultural Project.</p>\n\n<p>Nabena also mentioned a “multi-million dollar white elephant Shonga Agricultural Project in Kwara State when Saraki served as two-term governor.”</p>\n\n<p>6. Falsification of Senate Order</p>\n\n<p>The APC spokesman accused Saraki of “Falsification of Senate standing order""</p>\n\n<p>""Saraki’s link to the N298m armoured Range Rover SUV seized by the Nigeria Customs Service.”</p>\n\n<p>7. $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal</p>\n\n<p>“Saraki is link to $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal, he oversaw budget padding in the National Assembly among other numerous corruption scandals,” Nabena added.</p>\n\n<p>APC warns Nigerians</p>\n\n<p>The party also warned Nigerians to be wary of Saraki, who it says will always put himself over National interest.</p>\n\n<p>“Nigerians should be wary of a man whose personal ambition will always supersede the interest of the majority and national interest as currently displayed in the National Assembly.</p>\n\n<p>“While Saraki refuses to reconvene the National Assembly, the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is dangerously delayed, an action deliberately taken to sabotage INEC’s ability to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>“While Saraki refuses to step down as Senate President as rightly and severally demanded by the APC-dominated Senate, he is bent on foisting a PDP-minority rule (Senate President and Deputy Senate President) in the Upper Legislative House,” the statement added.</p>\n\n<p>Saraki\'s way</p>\n\n<p>Nabena, in the statement, also said Saraki only knows how to play politics that will benefit him alone.</p>\n\n<p>He said “The only politics that Bukola Saraki plays is self, himself only and only himself.

87	Canberk	INSHUR	Company	https://www.fintechnews.org/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires/	"Insurtech INSHUR, which raised $7m in February, has today announced four key appointments to help protect its customers from insurance fraud, in a bid to help keep premiums down.

Recent data released by the ABI shows that in 2016 and 2017 there were a total of 238,000 fraudulent claims detected by UK Insurers at a cost of £1.3 billion a year. Changes in the law regarding whiplash claims, through to fundamental dishonesty, have given insurers more tools to tackle fraudsters.

For many traditional, non-digital insurers, this remains a perennial problem, pushing up premiums and clogging the court system. It’s a problem INSHUR aims to reduce with its data-driven technology team.

In order to ensure the insurtech continues to enhance protection for its customers due to fraud, INSHUR has made four key hires; Mike Connolly as Head of Counter Fraud, Peter Truong as Senior Business Intelligence Developer, Milan Chavda as Head of Pricing, and John King as Head of Product.

Co-founder of INSHUR, David Daiches, said: “Data and security have always been at the heart of what we do to ensure our customers’ needs and safety is front of mind. In order to offer insurance for commercial drivers in just three minutes, compared to hours or even days, we created a platform that can tap into various data sources to quickly validate a driver, verify their driving history and provide an informed risk profile.

We’re excited to bring specialist and skilled professionals on board to ensure as we continue to grow we focus on combatting fraud, and therefore keep premiums down for our customers.”

Mike Connolly has 17 years’ insurance experience having worked in developing counter fraud strategies and systems at Hastings Direct, Westminster Insurance and Haven Claims.

Mike Connolly, Head of Counter Fraud, said: “I’m happy to join a company that is changing the way insurance is sold and is serious about creating new ways to utilise technology and data to protect its customers from fraud. My aim at INSHUR is to deploy the most cutting edge systems to detect and prevent fraud and see that these processes mirror the seamless experience in purchasing a policy from us.”

Prior to joining INSHUR Peter Truong was a Senior Business Intelligence Consultant working on business intelligence solutions across a range of industries including Banking, Insurance, Legal, Marketing and Public Services.

Talking about his new role, Peter Truong, Senior Business Intelligence Developer, said: “Working with the team at INSHUR, I intend to consolidate the huge amounts of data the organisation has access to, so we can develop frameworks and processes that will enable consistent and accurate business intelligence to both our partners and clients.”

Milan Chavda has extensive pricing and actuarial experience, working within the insurance industry across multiple underwriting and broker functions having worked at the BGL group, Tesco Underwriting, ERS and Complete Cover Group.

Milan Chavda, Head of Pricing, said: “My focus is on strategic pricing, including setting adequate rates, optimising prices and reviewing the actuarial performance of the insurance business. I look forward to getting to grips with INSHUR’s platform so I can apply advanced analytical techniques to the UK and US portfolios to ensure maximum success for the business.”

With over 13 years’ experience in the insurance industry, having formerly worked as Head of Innovation at Beazley, John King brings a wealth of experience from the client side. At Beazley John spent most of his time searching and interviewing insurtech companies to look for ways to innovate the traditional insurance model.

John King, Head of Product, said: “In my previous roles I have seen a massive disconnect between what the insurance companies were trying to do and what their customers actually needed. INSHUR is different, focusing on their users first and foremost, and then looking at how to make sure they deliver that product in a useful and meaningful way. It’s a more human way of doing insurance, which immediately attracted me to the company.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605094454366-489ea030caf692ed', 'domain': 'fintechnews.org', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.fintechnews.org/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.fintechnews.org/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires/', 'author': 'horacio', 'images': ['https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait,w_696,h_687/https://www.fintechnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires-696x687.jpeg', 'https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_696,h_687/https://www.fintechnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires-696x687.jpeg'], 'headline': 'INSHUR prioritises data to combat fraud with senior hires', 'mainImage': 'https://www.fintechnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/inshur-prioritises-data-to-combat-fraud-with-senior-hires-e1560944269638.jpeg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Insurtech INSHUR, which raised $7m in February, has today announced four key appointments to help protect its customers from insurance fraud, in a bid to help keep premiums down.\n\nRecent data released by the ABI shows that in 2016 and 2017 there were a total of 238,000 fraudulent claims detected by UK Insurers at a cost of £1.3 billion a year.

172	Sebastien			https://anti-corruption.org/pacific-cso-focus-on-reforms/	"THROUGHOUT the Pacific Islands region corruption remains a significant concern, slowing development and shaking public trust in public officials. Corruption can be encountered in a variety of sectors such as the process of harvesting and manufacturing illegal wood based products, illegal fishing, migrant smuggling and working illegally, amongst other crimes. In addition, corruption often facilitates transnational organized crime moving goods across borders and laundering money.

To confront this challenge over 60 representatives from 13 Pacific Island countries and territories met in Fiji in December 2015 for the Anti-Corruption Workshop for Pacific Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to discuss challenges, good practices and innovative anti-corruption reforms. The Workshop is providing participants with an opportunity to consider how corruption can be addressed in the Pacific, consistent with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).

The opening day sessions built upon the work completed at the recent 16th International Anti-Corruption Conference, highlighting the challenges faced regularly by anti-corruption advocates through sessions including ‘The Courage of a Whistleblower’ and ‘People. Accountability. Integrity’.

Banking and Mexican drug cartel whistleblower Martin Woods, now head of Financial Crime at Thomson Reuters, spoke of the courage officials need to honestly respond “I don’t know” when presented with disguised corruption-prone proposals.

UN-PRAC Regional Anti-Corruption Adviser, Ms Annika Wythes, told the workshop that civil society participants were a key to interrupting corruption. “When we talk about preventing and fighting corruption you are often the glue between the people and the Government – the way that you see an issue, address it and seek to tackle it is crucial.

154	Canberk	Mike Barrett	Person	https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7653726/driving-anti-money-laundering-efficiency-gains-using-artificial-intelligence	"Anti-money laundering (AML) is expensive and labour-intensive, and artificial intelligence (AI) can offer improved efficiency gains. Could they be a match made in heaven? This Risk.net webinar, in association with NICE Actimize, took place amid the strain on banks’ back offices driven by the lockdown in response to the global Covid‑19 pandemic, and explores this potential pairing

Today’s evolving regulatory environment and criminal typologies have influenced AML compliance teams to adopt AI technologies such as machine learning to improve detection and better focus analyst workloads.

The marriage of AI to existing compliance processes and risk modelling techniques has the potential to eliminate backlogs and create new efficiencies. But there may be some risks and question marks for those in the early stages of adoption.

The strain on many financial institutions has only increased in 2020 due to the unexpected arrival of Covid‑19. The subsequent lockdown presented enormous challenges. Fraud and AML teams are now – almost without exception – working from home, and the typical behaviour of corporate and retail customers has been inverted.

Problems around budgets, resources and priorities remain or have been redoubled for financial institutions. Regulators are still issuing fines for AML foul-ups. Financial criminals, meanwhile, are engaging in new rounds of scams and schemes to take advantage of the Covid‑19 pandemic.

“Clients are trading differently today than they were previously, and there’s a lot of volatility in the market,” said a chief compliance officer for a large European bank. “Most systems are calibrated to detect unusual activity, whether that’s increased volumes or changes in clients’ trading patterns. Consequently, there’s a lot more strain on our detection systems and our transaction monitoring guys are being kept very busy.”

The compliance head saw a rise in false positives, in part due to limitations on calibrating existing systems and the inability to anticipate current crisis event behaviours, warning that criminals and scammers are also ramping up activity.

“When you have a situation like Covid-19, the criminal fraternity see that as a great opportunity to try and test control frameworks within banks. We’ve seen an increase in the level of people who we would reject normally, and in any other situation they would not even attempt to open an account,” he said.

“The old classic scams, such as ‘I have $350 million tied up in a bank account in Nigeria; I just need this signature and some details’, had dissipated somewhat. Now, the scammers are back in force, using the pandemic situation to phish for an opportunity,” the chief compliance officer added.

Every crisis represents an opportunity for financial crime specialists looking to exploit the public, emphasised Andrew Fleming, global compliance MI, senior risk reporting manager at HSBC. This has led to a rise in scammers offering funds and posing as government or medical authorities to commit fraud.

“We’ve seen a number of these sorts of things already coming into play. One of my favourites was somebody in the US offering toothpaste that cured the disease,” said Fleming.

Covid‑19 could be a catalyst for creating more automation within banking processes, Fleming suggested, particularly if the illness or inability to work causes gaps in the ranks of teams working in risk and compliance roles.

“This pandemic could drive changes at a faster pace. It demonstrates the vulnerability of the human workforce and concentrates business minds on how they can derive value from the automation of processes, through robotic process automation and machine learning, and even deep learning, which is beginning to come into the fray,” he said.

“We’ve been looking at automation and driving digital change within the banking structure,” continued Fleming. “Machines might get the occasional virus that needs fixing but they’re not working from home and they work in a structure. Machines run 24 hours a day, seven days a week – and they’re driving efficiencies throughout the process.”

From a service provider’s perspective, Michael Barrett, senior director, product management, AML, at NICE Actimize, agreed that the pandemic has created an impetus for banks now that their focus is on operational efficiency and resilience.

“The need for technology to address some investigation elements is greater now than it ever has been before,” said Barrett. “Covid-19 has been a wake‑up call for many banking customers, some of whom had initiatives on the back burner to automate or streamline processes and address inefficiencies. Now they are in a situation where it’s front and centre of their agendas because they’re under pressure, and reliance on human interaction has become problematic.”

Seeing the wood for the trees

Big corporate customers for banks – such as retail department stores – are seeing an unprecedented drop in footfall in their premises since Covid‑19 lockdowns took effect. Some firms have gone into administration, while online shopping businesses are booming.

“Within that online demand you also get greater opportunity for financial crime,” Fleming said. “Fraudsters and money launderers are taking advantage of the situation because the volume of transactions is increasing, and companies may have a shortfall of staff because of sickness or be adapting to working remotely. Consequently, they are gambling that companies may miss fraudulent transactions that, under normal circumstances, would have been caught.”

Meanwhile, for money launderers, the Covid‑19 lockdown presents a different type of challenge because their schemes rely on cash-based businesses, such as barbers, tanning salons and car washes. “These criminals haven’t gone away. We still have drug dealers and fraudsters, and they need to get money into the system,” Fleming said.

“These people will look to use enablers, such as gatekeeper professionals, to get around systems. They may create new companies to try and demonstrate that they’ve got legitimate sources for funds. We’re going to be challenged with identifying these companies and identifying where this criminal money is now coming in,” he warned.

The chief compliance officer cautioned that the sudden changes in behaviour across society are making it harder – it’s increasingly difficult to spot the good money from the bad.

“Covid‑19 has triggered a massive change in behaviour across the board. We’re not a retail bank, so we’re more involved in combating the layering stage of money laundering, but we are seeing very strange behaviours from a number of our clients,” he said.

“That could be because they’ve started to launder money or it could just be a function of what’s going on in the market. We’re using up a lot more time and energy investigating those alerts than previously. It’s quite a challenge to see the wood for the trees,” he added.

Barrett proposed actions to address that challenge. First, by establishing what has gone wrong with the existing systems unable to cope with inverted transaction behaviour, and how these systems need to be refined.

“The first element to address is to perform some rapid tuning,” Barrett said. “We have an ActimizeWatch service, which allows us to monitor and understand where systems are degrading.”

“Where there’s a spike in alerts and unexpected behaviour, we’re able to model that with our own data science team on behalf of our customers, which can then provide the client with recommendations for thresholds to adjust. That’s a great way of us being able to quickly identify where a system needs to be refined,” he explained.

Opportunists among the criminals represent another challenge, Barrett suggested, requiring a focus on looking at new typologies and new behaviours. Suspicious behaviour patterns are emerging fast, and need to be found and captured quickly.

“In instances where cash-based industries have had no revenue for weeks or months, similar companies still operating a high turnover could be suspicious. Therefore, we’re working to analyse the potential for analytics based on behaviour by industry code as an example,” he said.

Of course, one danger with tweaking systems to detect unusual behaviours during crises is that, once normal conditions resume, a system could continue to identify trends that no longer apply.

“Absolutely, that’s a danger. We can’t model the new normal as the normal forever,” Barrett responded. “It will change again, and things will readapt and hopefully settle back down into a more consistent pattern. However, if current behaviour lasts for weeks or months, that’s too long to ignore. So we need to learn quickly now, then we need to adapt again once we are trending back into what would be the traditional normal pattern.”

Fleming agreed that model analysis element and dynamic risk assessment is exactly what’s needed. “We need to be able to develop new tools and strategies that are able to adapt in a dynamic risk situation. That includes being able to rapidly tune these technologies to meet the changing landscape,” he said.

Typical legacy systems at many banks lack the flexibility to be used dynamically, Fleming noted, taking too long to fix and change. “These new technologies need to be much quicker at adapting to new threats and new scenarios that come to the fore,” said Barrett. “I think every business has to be more agile in how it deals with threats. If we don’t do that then we’re going to get caught out.”

Approaches to machine learning

AML is just one of many applications for machine learning technology. Barrett gave his perspective on its use, beginning with the critical task of clustering and segmenting data, from which anomalies can be found, accurately targeting suspicious elements for any given data.

He described ‘step one’ for targeted detection towards getting better results from models: “We have machine learning models that assist with that clustering process, which carves out the data in the most effective way in the first place. Then we have additional AI technology that takes those segments and applies machine learning techniques to develop tuning thresholds and policies associated with those segments.”

He added: “Those technologies come hand in hand. Segmentation and optimised tuning are a package of machine learning we develop that allows for that automatic tuning based on precisely targeted segments,” he added.

The second step uses predictive models to learn the human investigation process, overlaying the human intelligence of the compliance team onto the systems themselves.

“Let’s learn about those investigations and factor that in as part of a model to feed back on any new alerts that have been produced. That way we can understand and provide insights into the likelihood of those alerts being particularly suspicious or, alternatively, even candidates for hibernation,” Barrett said.

“The third aspect is to provide machine learning models to introduce new detection capabilities themselves, by producing models for advanced anomaly detection, to allow for new typologies to be introduced, and so on,” he added.

Fleming added to this the need to demonstrate that internal controls are effective and the right governing structures are in place for delivering what’s needed for the customer, the business and the regulator. This means placing a focus on those controls and the supporting governance to ensure they are delivering what is required, he underlined.

“First of all, you want to be able to provide the customers with a seamless service that makes the end-to-end processing as painless as possible,” he said. “Second, you want to be able to protect the business and identify and reduce risks earlier on, driving operational efficiencies and effectiveness. We also want to be able to demonstrate to the regulators what we’re doing and how we’re managing risks effectively.”

New toys

Regulators have been somewhat neutral about AI and machine learning, in some instances encouraging innovation, but without specifying much in the way of good or bad practice – or what compliance benefits or pitfalls may await firms that innovate.

“Certainly, the UK regulator has never sanctioned any type of AI or machine learning products or processes,” said the chief compliance officer. “The regulator’s view is realistic; it’s that financial institutions should have systems and controls commensurate with the size and complexity of their business.

“If you tell them you’re processing a million payments a day, there is no way you can effectively screen them all without a sophisticated system that is well tested, checked and maintained. One of the few things regulators don’t mandate is whether any of your AML processes are automated. You could hire 10,000 people to do all your checks manually. You might go bust doing it, but you wouldn’t be in breach of the rules.”

On the other hand, the chief compliance officer noted regulatory dissatisfaction when, the regulators having conducted their investigations, they found out firms had invested in sophisticated technology but were then lax or incompetent in the testing, maintenance or use of it.

“Firms can shoot themselves in the foot,” he continued. “There are final notices mentioning when the regulator went into a certain firm they were disappointed to find that, although it had spent millions of pounds on various systems, the firm either hadn’t switched them on properly, or were just using the factory settings.”

Firms will get little sympathy from the regulator if they are investing in technology they don’t understand or don’t use properly, Fleming agreed. “The regulator is concerned that you understand you own the risk. Just because you’ve brought in a new toy – and no matter what the new technology is – they want to see it’s producing better results, and that you’re taking responsibility for it.”

Rare is the firm that chooses to build all its systems itself. Service providers therefore play an important role in providing regulatory confidence in their clients’ AML systems and models, and the governance in place to manage them responsibly.

“To meet governance expectations, evidence is provided on a number of different levels of detail right down to the specific algorithms used and the data attributes being fed in – everything around how the models are tuned to a specific customer environment,” said Barrett.

Transparency is a big part of this, he explained, requiring detailed dashboards to track model performance, allowing customers to peek under the bonnet and intervene when necessary.

Below-the-line testing strategies represent another key element to building regulators’ confidence for a new machine learning model, Barrett added. “Below-the-line testing is a key weapon in the armoury for ensuring that AML systems are strong, secure and doing exactly what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said.

“It’s vital there’s a solid below-the-line testing strategy in place. That’s so we can prove if all the thresholds are moved, or different rules are put in place, that these would be the events that would be produced, and if you investigated them you would understand that there is no suspicious behaviour there.”

Specialist skills

Part of that competence involves the skills of the AML teams tasked increasingly with managing technology as well as people. The skills required are inevitably shifting with the tools and techniques used.

Fleming said: “We have a good number of data scientists, but whether or not we have the right specialties in place to be good at working on the various types of financial crime, AML, fraud, tax evasion and tackling terrorism financing, I suspect not. You want to get the right people, with the right skill sets, and you do need to pay for that.”

The chief compliance officer agreed, adding that he had embarked on a part-time data science course. “Maybe I’m one of the compliance people that’s seen the light and is heading towards the data science field.” He suggested that, while there are probably enough data scientists on the payroll, AML specialist background experience is harder to come by and expensive.

“The population Venn diagram of those data scientists that cross over with any AML knowledge is very small, and that can put them beyond the budget that firms are willing to spend,” he said.

“Before you can get people to start committing budget to these things, you really have to make sure the organisation has made a commitment to being data-driven from the top. By that I mean having a chief executive officer and heads of compliance and risk who are tech-savvy themselves and understand the benefits.”

As a service provider, Barrett tries to supplement clients’ expertise with that of his own team, allowing them to focus their own resources on the crucial modelling efforts.

“We’ll build the infrastructure, we’ll flatten the data, we’ll provide the tooling. Our customers’ data science teams can then use that tooling to actually do the modelling,” he said. “We feel we can really help our customers have a laser-focused approach to doing modelling work and applying their data science minds in the right way.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605093875548-71f146f5022d4d01', 'domain': 'risk.net', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7653726/driving-anti-money-laundering-efficiency-gains-using-artificial-intelligence', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7653726/driving-anti-money-laundering-efficiency-gains-using-artificial-intelligence', 'images': ['https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/styles/portrait_230_372/public/2020-07/Mike%20Barrett%2C%20NICE%20Actimize.jpg?itok=zzkp1VsR', 'https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/styles/landscape_750_463/public/2020-07/GettyImages-864001400%20web.jpg?itok=7vOZ-hrQ'], 'headline': 'Driving anti-money laundering efficiency gains using artificial intelligence', 'mainImage': 'https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/styles/metatag_image/public/2020-07/GettyImages-864001400%20web.jpg?itok=J6kQkL_V', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Anti-money laundering (AML) is expensive and labour-intensive, and artificial intelligence (AI) can offer improved efficiency gains.

Consequently, there’s a lot more strain on our detection systems and our transaction monitoring guys are being kept very busy.”\n\nThe compliance head saw a rise in false positives, in part due to limitations on calibrating existing systems and the inability to anticipate current crisis event behaviours, warning that criminals and scammers are also ramping up activity.\n\n“When you have a situation like Covid-19, the criminal fraternity see that as a great opportunity to try and test control frameworks within banks. We’ve seen an increase in the level of people who we would reject normally, and in any other situation they would not even attempt to open an account,” he said.\n\n“The old classic scams, such as ‘I have $350 million tied up in a bank account in Nigeria; I just need this signature and some details’, had dissipated somewhat. Now, the scammers are back in force, using the pandemic situation to phish for an opportunity,” the chief compliance officer added.\n\nEvery crisis represents an opportunity for financial crime specialists looking to exploit the public, emphasised Andrew Fleming, global compliance MI, senior risk reporting manager at HSBC. This has led to a rise in scammers offering funds and posing as government or medical authorities to commit fraud.\n\n“We’ve seen a number of these sorts of things already coming into play. One of my favourites was somebody in the US offering toothpaste that cured the disease,” said Fleming.\n\nCovid‑19 could be a catalyst for creating more automation within banking processes, Fleming suggested, particularly if the illness or inability to work causes gaps in the ranks of teams working in risk and compliance roles.\n\n“This pandemic could drive changes at a faster pace. It demonstrates the vulnerability of the human workforce and concentrates business minds on how they can derive value from the automation of processes, through robotic process automation and machine learning, and even deep learning, which is beginning to come into the fray,” he said.\n\n“We’ve been looking at automation and driving digital change within the banking structure,” continued Fleming. “Machines might get the occasional virus that needs fixing but they’re not working from home and they work in a structure. Machines run 24 hours a day, seven days a week – and they’re driving efficiencies throughout the process.”\n\nFrom a service provider’s perspective, Michael Barrett, senior director, product management, AML, at NICE Actimize, agreed that the pandemic has created an impetus for banks now that their focus is on operational efficiency and resilience.\n\n“The need for technology to address some investigation elements is greater now than it ever has been before,” said Barrett. “Covid-19 has been a wake‑up call for many banking customers, some of whom had initiatives on the back burner to automate or streamline processes and address inefficiencies. Now they are in a situation where it’s front and centre of their agendas because they’re under pressure, and reliance on human interaction has become problematic.”\n\nSeeing the wood for the trees\n\nBig corporate customers for banks – such as retail department stores – are seeing an unprecedented drop in footfall in their premises since Covid‑19 lockdowns took effect. Some firms have gone into administration, while online shopping businesses are booming.\n\n“Within that online demand you also get greater opportunity for financial crime,” Fleming said. “Fraudsters and money launderers are taking advantage of the situation because the volume of transactions is increasing, and companies may have a shortfall of staff because of sickness or be adapting to working remotely. Consequently, they are gambling that companies may miss fraudulent transactions that, under normal circumstances, would have been caught.”\n\nMeanwhile, for money launderers, the Covid‑19 lockdown presents a different type of challenge because their schemes rely on cash-based businesses, such as barbers, tanning salons and car washes. “These criminals haven’t gone away. We still have drug dealers and fraudsters, and they need to get money into the system,” Fleming said.\n\n“These people will look to use enablers, such as gatekeeper professionals, to get around systems. They may create new companies to try and demonstrate that they’ve got legitimate sources for funds. We’re going to be challenged with identifying these companies and identifying where this criminal money is now coming in,” he warned.\n\nThe chief compliance officer cautioned that the sudden changes in behaviour across society are making it harder – it’s increasingly difficult to spot the good money from the bad.\n\n“Covid‑19 has triggered a massive change in behaviour across the board. We’re not a retail bank, so we’re more involved in combating the layering stage of money laundering, but we are seeing very strange behaviours from a number of our clients,” he said.\n\n“That could be because they’ve started to launder money or it could just be a function of what’s going on in the market. We’re using up a lot more time and energy investigating those alerts than previously. It’s quite a challenge to see the wood for the trees,” he added.\n\nBarrett proposed actions to address that challenge. First, by establishing what has gone wrong with the existing systems unable to cope with inverted transaction behaviour, and how these systems need to be refined.\n\n“The first element to address is to perform some rapid tuning,” Barrett said. “We have an ActimizeWatch service, which allows us to monitor and understand where systems are degrading.”\n\n“Where there’s a spike in alerts and unexpected behaviour, we’re able to model that with our own data science team on behalf of our customers, which can then provide the client with recommendations for thresholds to adjust. That’s a great way of us being able to quickly identify where a system needs to be refined,” he explained.\n\nOpportunists among the criminals represent another challenge, Barrett suggested, requiring a focus on looking at new typologies and new behaviours. Suspicious behaviour patterns are emerging fast, and need to be found and captured quickly.\n\n“In instances where cash-based industries have had no revenue for weeks or months, similar companies still operating a high turnover could be suspicious. Therefore, we’re working to analyse the potential for analytics based on behaviour by industry code as an example,” he said.\n\nOf course, one danger with tweaking systems to detect unusual behaviours during crises is that, once normal conditions resume, a system could continue to identify trends that no longer apply.\n\n“Absolutely, that’s a danger. We can’t model the new normal as the normal forever,” Barrett responded. “It will change again, and things will readapt and hopefully settle back down into a more consistent pattern. However, if current behaviour lasts for weeks or months, that’s too long to ignore. So we need to learn quickly now, then we need to adapt again once we are trending back into what would be the traditional normal pattern.”\n\nFleming agreed that model analysis element and dynamic risk assessment is exactly what’s needed. “We need to be able to develop new tools and strategies that are able to adapt in a dynamic risk situation. That includes being able to rapidly tune these technologies to meet the changing landscape,” he said.\n\nTypical legacy systems at many banks lack the flexibility to be used dynamically, Fleming noted, taking too long to fix and change. “These new technologies need to be much quicker at adapting to new threats and new scenarios that come to the fore,” said Barrett. “I think every business has to be more agile in how it deals with threats. If we don’t do that then we’re going to get caught out.”\n\nApproaches to machine learning\n\nAML is just one of many applications for machine learning technology. Barrett gave his perspective on its use, beginning with the critical task of clustering and segmenting data, from which anomalies can be found, accurately targeting suspicious elements for any given data.\n\nHe described ‘step one’ for targeted detection towards getting better results from models: “We have machine learning models that assist with that clustering process, which carves out the data in the most effective way in the first place. Then we have additional AI technology that takes those segments and applies machine learning techniques to develop tuning thresholds and policies associated with those segments.”\n\nHe added: “Those technologies come hand in hand. Segmentation and optimised tuning are a package of machine learning we develop that allows for that automatic tuning based on precisely targeted segments,” he added.\n\nThe second step uses predictive models to learn the human investigation process, overlaying the human intelligence of the compliance team onto the systems themselves.\n\n“Let’s learn about those investigations and factor that in as part of a model to feed back on any new alerts that have been produced. That way we can understand and provide insights into the likelihood of those alerts being particularly suspicious or, alternatively, even candidates for hibernation,” Barrett said.\n\n“The third aspect is to provide machine learning models to introduce new detection capabilities themselves, by producing models for advanced anomaly detection, to allow for new typologies to be introduced, and so on,” he added.\n\nFleming added to this the need to demonstrate that internal controls are effective and the right governing structures are in place for delivering what’s needed for the customer, the business and the regulator. This means placing a focus on those controls and the supporting governance to ensure they are delivering what is required, he underlined.\n\n“First of all, you want to be able to provide the customers with a seamless service that makes the end-to-end processing as painless as possible,” he said. “Second, you want to be able to protect the business and identify and reduce risks earlier on, driving operational efficiencies and effectiveness. We also want to be able to demonstrate to the regulators what we’re doing and how we’re managing risks effectively.”\n\nNew toys\n\nRegulators have been somewhat neutral about AI and machine learning, in some instances encouraging innovation, but without specifying much in the way of good or bad practice – or what compliance benefits or pitfalls may await firms that innovate.\n\n“Certainly, the UK regulator has never sanctioned any type of AI or machine learning products or processes,” said the chief compliance officer. “The regulator’s view is realistic; it’s that financial institutions should have systems and controls commensurate with the size and complexity of their business.\n\n“If you tell them you’re processing a million payments a day, there is no way you can effectively screen them all without a sophisticated system that is well tested, checked and maintained. One of the few things regulators don’t mandate is whether any of your AML processes are automated. You could hire 10,000 people to do all your checks manually. You might go bust doing it, but you wouldn’t be in breach of the rules.”\n\nOn the other hand, the chief compliance officer noted regulatory dissatisfaction when, the regulators having conducted their investigations, they found out firms had invested in sophisticated technology but were then lax or incompetent in the testing, maintenance or use of it.\n\n“Firms can shoot themselves in the foot,” he continued. “There are final notices mentioning when the regulator went into a certain firm they were disappointed to find that, although it had spent millions of pounds on various systems, the firm either hadn’t switched them on properly, or were just using the factory settings.”\n\nFirms will get little sympathy from the regulator if they are investing in technology they don’t understand or don’t use properly, Fleming agreed. “The regulator is concerned that you understand you own the risk. Just because you’ve brought in a new toy – and no matter what the new technology is – they want to see it’s producing better results, and that you’re taking responsibility for it.”\n\nRare is the firm that chooses to build all its systems itself. Service providers therefore play an important role in providing regulatory confidence in their clients’ AML systems and models, and the governance in place to manage them responsibly.\n\n“To meet governance expectations, evidence is provided on a number of different levels of detail right down to the specific algorithms used and the data attributes being fed in – everything around how the models are tuned to a specific customer environment,” said Barrett.\n\nTransparency is a big part of this, he explained, requiring detailed dashboards to track model performance, allowing customers to peek under the bonnet and intervene when necessary.\n\nBelow-the-line testing strategies represent another key element to building regulators’ confidence for a new machine learning model, Barrett added. “Below-the-line testing is a key weapon in the armoury for ensuring that AML systems are strong, secure and doing exactly what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said.\n\n“It’s vital there’s a solid below-the-line testing strategy in place. That’s so we can prove if all the thresholds are moved, or different rules are put in place, that these would be the events that would be produced, and if you investigated them you would understand that there is no suspicious behaviour there.”\n\nSpecialist skills\n\nPart of that competence involves the skills of the AML teams tasked increasingly with managing technology as well as people. The skills required are inevitably shifting with the tools and techniques used.\n\nFleming said: “We have a good number of data scientists, but whether or not we have the right specialties in place to be good at working on the various types of financial crime, AML, fraud, tax evasion and tackling terrorism financing, I suspect not. You want to get the right people, with the right skill sets, and you do need to pay for that.”\n\nThe chief compliance officer agreed, adding that he had embarked on a part-time data science course. “Maybe I’m one of the compliance people that’s seen the light and is heading towards the data science field.” He suggested that, while there are probably enough data scientists on the payroll, AML specialist background experience is harder to come by and expensive.\n\n“The population Venn diagram of those data scientists that cross over with any AML knowledge is very small, and that can put them beyond the budget that firms are willing to spend,” he said.\n\n“Before you can get people to start committing budget to these things, you really have to make sure the organisation has made a commitment to being data-driven from the top. By that I mean having a chief executive officer and heads of compliance and risk who are tech-savvy themselves and understand the benefits.”\n\nAs a service provider, Barrett tries to supplement clients’ expertise with that of his own team, allowing them to focus their own resources on the crucial modelling efforts.\n\n“We’ll build the infrastructure, we’ll flatten the data, we’ll provide the tooling. Our customers’ data science teams can then use that tooling to actually do the modelling,” he said. “We feel we can really help our customers have a laser-focused approach to doing modelling work and applying their data science minds in the right way.”', 'description': 'Anti-money laundering (AML) is expensive and labour-intensive, and artificial intelligence (AI)\xa0can offer improved efficiency gains.

Could they be a match made in heaven? This <em>Risk.net</em> webinar, in association with NICE Actimize, took place amid the strain on banks’ back offices driven by the lockdown in response to the global Covid‑19 pandemic, and explores this potential pairing</strong></p>\n\n<figure><img alt=""Mike Barrett, NICE Actimize"" src=""https://www.risk.net/sites/risk/files/styles/portrait_230_372/public/2020-07/Mike%20Barrett%2C%20NICE%20Actimize.jpg?itok=zzkp1VsR""><figcaption>Mike Barrett</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Today’s evolving regulatory environment and criminal typologies have influenced AML\xa0compliance teams to adopt AI technologies such as machine learning to improve detection and better focus analyst workloads.</p>\n\n<p>The marriage of AI to existing compliance processes and risk modelling techniques has the potential to eliminate backlogs and create new efficiencies. But there may be some risks and question marks for those in the early stages of adoption.</p>\n\n<p>The strain on many financial institutions has only increased in 2020 due to the unexpected arrival of Covid‑19. The subsequent lockdown presented enormous challenges. Fraud and AML teams are now\xa0– almost without exception\xa0– working from home, and the typical behaviour of corporate and retail customers has been inverted.</p>\n\n<p>Problems around budgets, resources and priorities remain or have been redoubled for financial institutions. Regulators are still issuing fines for AML foul-ups. Financial criminals, meanwhile, are engaging in new rounds of scams and schemes to take advantage of the Covid‑19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>“Clients are trading differently today than they were previously, and there’s a lot of volatility in the market,” said a chief compliance officer for a large European bank. “Most systems are calibrated to detect unusual activity, whether that’s increased volumes or changes in clients’ trading patterns. Consequently, there’s a lot more strain on our detection systems and our transaction monitoring guys are being kept very busy.”</p>\n\n<p>The compliance head saw a rise in false positives, in part due to limitations on calibrating existing systems and the inability to anticipate current crisis event behaviours, warning that criminals and scammers are also ramping up activity.</p>\n\n<p>“When you have a situation like Covid-19, the criminal fraternity see that as a great opportunity to try and test control frameworks within banks. We’ve seen an increase in the level of people who we would reject normally, and in any other situation they would not even attempt to open an account,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“The old classic scams, such as ‘I have $350\xa0million tied up in a bank account in Nigeria; I just need this signature and some details’, had dissipated somewhat. Now, the scammers are back in force, using the pandemic situation to phish for an opportunity,” the chief compliance officer added.</p>\n\n<p>Every crisis represents an opportunity for financial crime specialists looking to exploit the public, emphasised Andrew Fleming, global compliance MI, senior risk reporting manager at HSBC. This has led to a rise in scammers offering funds and posing as government or medical authorities to commit fraud.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve seen a number of these sorts of things already coming into play. One of my favourites was somebody in the US offering toothpaste that cured the disease,” said Fleming.</p>\n\n<p>Covid‑19 could be a catalyst for creating more automation within banking processes, Fleming suggested, particularly if the illness or inability to work causes gaps in the ranks of teams working in risk and compliance roles.</p>\n\n<p>“This pandemic could drive changes at a faster pace. It demonstrates the vulnerability of the human workforce and concentrates business minds on how they can derive value from the automation of processes, through robotic process automation and machine learning, and even deep learning, which is beginning to come into the fray,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve been looking at automation and driving digital change within the banking structure,” continued Fleming. “Machines might get the occasional virus that needs fixing but they’re not working from home and they work in a structure. Machines run 24 hours a day, seven days a week\xa0– and they’re driving efficiencies throughout the process.”</p>\n\n<p>From a service provider’s perspective, Michael Barrett, senior director, product management, AML, at NICE Actimize, agreed that the pandemic has created an impetus for banks now that their focus is on operational efficiency and\xa0resilience.</p>\n\n<p>“The need for technology to address some investigation elements is greater now than it ever has been before,” said Barrett. “Covid-19 has been a wake‑up call for many banking customers, some of whom had initiatives on the back burner to automate or streamline processes and address inefficiencies. Now they are in a situation where it’s front and centre of their agendas because they’re under pressure, and reliance on human interaction has become\xa0problematic.”</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Seeing the wood for the trees</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Big corporate customers for banks\xa0– such as retail department stores\xa0– are seeing an unprecedented drop in footfall in their premises since Covid‑19 lockdowns took effect. Some firms have gone into administration, while online shopping businesses are\xa0booming.</p>\n\n<p>“Within that online demand you also get greater opportunity for financial crime,” Fleming said. “Fraudsters and money launderers are taking advantage of the situation because the volume of transactions is increasing, and companies may have a shortfall of staff because of sickness or be adapting to working remotely. Consequently, they are gambling that companies may miss fraudulent transactions that, under normal circumstances, would have been caught.”</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, for money launderers, the Covid‑19 lockdown presents a different type of challenge because their schemes rely on cash-based businesses, such as barbers, tanning salons and car washes. “These criminals haven’t gone away. We still have drug dealers and fraudsters, and they need to get money into the system,” Fleming said.</p>\n\n<p>“These people will look to use enablers, such as gatekeeper professionals, to get around systems. They may create new companies to try and demonstrate that they’ve got legitimate sources for funds. We’re going to be challenged with identifying these companies and identifying where this criminal money is now coming in,” he warned.</p>\n\n<p>The chief compliance officer cautioned that the sudden changes in behaviour across society are making it harder – it’s increasingly difficult to spot the good money from the bad.</p>\n\n<p>“Covid‑19 has triggered a massive change in behaviour across the board. We’re not a retail bank, so we’re more involved in combating the layering stage of money laundering, but we are seeing very strange behaviours from a number of our clients,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“That could be because they’ve started to launder money or it could just be a function of what’s going on in the market. We’re using up a lot more time and energy investigating those alerts than previously. It’s quite a challenge to see the wood for the trees,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>Barrett proposed actions to address that challenge. First, by establishing what has gone wrong with the existing systems unable to cope with inverted transaction behaviour, and how these systems need to be refined.</p>\n\n<p>“The first element to address is to perform some rapid tuning,” Barrett said. “We have an ActimizeWatch service, which allows us to monitor and understand where systems are degrading.”</p>\n\n<p>“Where there’s a spike in alerts and unexpected behaviour, we’re able to model that with our own data science team on behalf of our customers, which can then provide the client with recommendations for thresholds to adjust. That’s a great way of us being able to quickly identify where a system needs to be refined,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunists among the criminals represent another challenge, Barrett suggested, requiring a focus on looking at new typologies and new behaviours. Suspicious behaviour patterns are emerging fast, and need to be found and captured quickly.</p>\n\n<p>“In instances where cash-based industries have had no revenue for weeks or months, similar companies still operating a high turnover could be suspicious. Therefore, we’re working to analyse the potential for analytics based on behaviour by industry code as an example,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, one danger with tweaking systems to detect unusual behaviours during crises is that, once normal conditions resume, a system could continue to identify trends that no longer\xa0apply.</p>\n\n<p>“Absolutely, that’s a danger. We can’t model the new normal as the normal forever,” Barrett responded. “It will change again, and things will readapt and hopefully settle back down into a more consistent pattern. However, if current behaviour lasts for weeks or months, that’s too long to ignore. So we need to learn quickly now, then we need to adapt again once we are trending back into what would be the traditional normal pattern.”</p>\n\n<p>Fleming agreed that model analysis element and dynamic risk assessment is exactly what’s needed. “We need to be able to develop new tools and strategies that are able to adapt in a dynamic risk situation. That includes being able to rapidly tune these technologies to meet the changing landscape,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Typical legacy systems at many banks lack the flexibility to be used dynamically, Fleming noted, taking too long to fix and change. “These new technologies need to be much quicker at adapting to new threats and new scenarios that come to the fore,” said Barrett. “I think every business has to be more agile in how it deals with threats. If we don’t do that then we’re going to get caught out.”</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Approaches to machine learning\xa0</strong></h2>\n\n<p>AML is just one of many applications for machine learning technology. Barrett gave his perspective on its use, beginning with the critical task of clustering and segmenting data, from which anomalies can be found, accurately targeting suspicious elements for any given data.</p>\n\n<p>He described ‘step one’ for targeted detection towards getting better results from models: “We have machine learning models that assist with that clustering process, which carves out the data in the most effective way in the first place. Then we have additional AI technology that takes those segments and applies machine learning techniques to develop tuning thresholds and policies associated with those segments.”</p>\n\n<p>He added: “Those technologies come hand in hand. Segmentation and optimised tuning are a package of machine learning we develop that allows for that automatic tuning based on precisely targeted segments,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>The second step uses predictive models to learn the human investigation process, overlaying the human intelligence of the compliance team onto the systems themselves.</p>\n\n<p>“Let’s learn about those investigations and factor that in as part of a model to feed back on any new alerts that have been produced. That way we can understand and provide insights into the likelihood of those alerts being particularly suspicious or, alternatively, even candidates for hibernation,” Barrett\xa0said.</p>\n\n<p>“The third aspect is to provide machine learning models to introduce new detection capabilities themselves, by producing models for advanced anomaly detection, to allow for new typologies to be introduced, and so on,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>Fleming added to this the need to demonstrate that internal controls are effective and the right governing structures are in place for delivering what’s needed for the customer, the business and the regulator. This means placing a focus on those controls and the supporting governance to ensure they are delivering what is required, he underlined.</p>\n\n<p>“First of all, you want to be able to provide the customers with a seamless service that makes the end-to-end processing as painless as possible,” he said. “Second, you want to be able to protect the business and identify and reduce risks earlier on, driving operational efficiencies and effectiveness. We also want to be able to demonstrate to the regulators what we’re doing and how we’re managing risks effectively.”</p>\n\n<h2><strong>New toys</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Regulators have been somewhat neutral about AI and machine learning, in some instances encouraging innovation, but without specifying much in the way of good or bad practice – or what compliance benefits or pitfalls may await firms that innovate.</p>\n\n<p>“Certainly, the UK regulator has never sanctioned any type of AI or machine learning products or processes,” said the chief compliance officer. “The regulator’s view is realistic; it’s that financial institutions should have systems and controls commensurate with the size and complexity of their business.</p>\n\n<p>“If you tell them you’re processing a million payments a day, there is no way you can effectively screen them all without a sophisticated system that is well tested, checked and maintained. One of the few things regulators don’t mandate is whether any of your AML processes are automated. You could hire 10,000 people to do all your checks manually. You might go bust doing it, but you wouldn’t be in breach of the rules.”</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the chief compliance officer noted regulatory dissatisfaction when, the regulators having conducted their investigations, they found out firms had invested in sophisticated technology but were then lax or incompetent in the testing, maintenance or use of it.</p>\n\n<p>“Firms can shoot themselves in the foot,” he continued. “There are final notices mentioning when the regulator went into a certain firm they were disappointed to find that, although it had spent millions of pounds on various systems, the firm either hadn’t switched them on properly, or were just using the factory settings.”</p>\n\n<p>Firms will get little sympathy from the regulator if they are investing in technology they don’t understand or don’t use properly, Fleming agreed. “The regulator is concerned that you understand you own the risk. Just because you’ve brought in a new toy – and no matter what the new technology is – they want to see it’s producing better results, and that you’re taking responsibility for it.”</p>\n\n<p>Rare is the firm that chooses to build all its systems itself. Service providers therefore play an important role in providing regulatory confidence in their clients’ AML systems and models, and the governance in place to manage them responsibly.</p>\n\n<p>“To meet governance expectations, evidence is provided on a number of different levels of detail right down to the specific algorithms used and the data attributes being fed in\xa0– everything around how the models are tuned to a specific customer environment,” said Barrett.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is a big part of this, he explained, requiring detailed dashboards to track model performance, allowing customers to peek under the bonnet and intervene when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Below-the-line testing strategies represent another key element to building regulators’ confidence for a new machine learning model, Barrett added. “Below-the-line testing is a key weapon in the armoury for ensuring that AML systems are strong, secure and doing exactly what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s vital there’s a solid below-the-line testing strategy in place. That’s so we can prove if all the thresholds are moved, or different rules are put in place, that these would be the events that would be produced, and if you investigated them you would understand that there is no suspicious behaviour there.”</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Specialist skills</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Part of that competence involves the skills of the AML teams tasked increasingly with managing technology as well as people. The skills required are inevitably shifting with the tools and techniques used.</p>\n\n<p>Fleming said: “We have a good number of data scientists, but whether or not we have the right specialties in place to be good at working on the various types of financial crime, AML, fraud, tax evasion and tackling terrorism financing, I suspect not. You want to get the right people, with the right skill sets, and you do need to pay for that.”</p>\n\n<p>The chief compliance officer agreed, adding that he had embarked on a part-time data science course. “Maybe I’m one of the compliance people that’s seen the light and is heading towards the data science field.” He suggested that, while there are probably enough data scientists on the payroll, AML specialist background experience is harder to come by and expensive.</p>\n\n<p>“The population Venn diagram of those data scientists that cross over with any AML knowledge is very small, and that can put them beyond the budget that firms are willing to spend,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“Before you can get people to start committing budget to these things, you really have to make sure the organisation has made a commitment to being data-driven from the top. By that I mean having a chief executive officer and heads of compliance and risk who are tech-savvy themselves and understand the\xa0benefits.”</p>\n\n<p>As a service provider, Barrett tries to supplement clients’ expertise with that of his own team, allowing them to focus their own resources on the crucial modelling efforts.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ll build the infrastructure, we’ll flatten the data, we’ll provide the tooling. Our customers’ data science teams can then use that tooling to actually do the modelling,” he said. “We feel we can really help our customers have a laser-focused approach to doing modelling work and applying their data science minds in the right way.”</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-07-13T11:22:21+01:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '10 Jul 2020'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	1	"""money laundering"", ""fraud"", ""tax evasion"", ""terrorism"""	Carel		Driving anti-money laundering efficiency gains using artificial intelligence

The US justice department told the NBI the Iranian was indicted in the District Court of Columbia for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel “with nuclear applications” which were considered suitable for gas centrifuges used in uranium enrichment.

Money laundering

Records showed Khaki was also charged by the US justice department with money laundering and violating US laws with respect to the American embargo against Iran.

NBI records showed the Iranian was on his way back to Iran when he was arrested by NBI agents at Naia Terminal 1 on May 26, 2012.

Khaki’s extradition to the US did not push through, however, after the Iranian Embassy filed a petition in Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 21 opposing his extradition.

The Iranian remained in NBI custody while his extradition case was pending in the Manila court.

NBI foreign liaison chief Daniel Daganzo said Khaki suffered a heart attack around 8 p.m. on Monday and was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital but he succumbed around 11 p.m.

He said that with the death, Khaki’s case would now be handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.

330	Sebastien	Grace Mugabe	individual	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/south-african-police-issue-arrest-warrant-for-grace-mugabe-zimbabwe-accused-assault-hotel	"South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabwe’s former first lady Grace Mugabe in relation to an alleged assault on a woman in a hotel in Johannesburg last year.

Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of beating the “hell out” of her with an electrical extension cord in a room at the Capital 20 West hotel in Johannesburg’s Sandton district. After the alleged assault came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity. That immunity was overturned by a court this year after Engels, a model, challenged the decision.

“I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,” said Vishnu Naidoo, a spokesman for South Africa’s police service. He said police were seeking Interpol’s help to enforce the warrant.

There was no immediate comment from Grace Mugabe.

The two countries have an extradition agreement, but Zimbabwe’s deputy minister for information, Energy Mutodi, told Reuters that Harare would not extradite Mugabe.

“I believe the government of Zimbabwe will not tolerate any harassment or degrading treatment on the former president Mugabe and his immediate family members,” Mutodi said, adding that he would need to consult with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on a final decision.

Grace Mugabe, 53, was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband, Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year.

She has denied assaulting Engels with an extension cord, saying an “intoxicated and unhinged” Engels attacked her with a knife after going to see the Mugabe’s sons at the hotel. The South African advocacy group AfriForum, which represented Engels, has accused Mugabe of lying.

Mugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted. Elections in August were won by Mnangagwa, his former righthand man in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

The warrant comes days after a long-awaited report into the killing of six people by soldiers during a post-elections protest in Harare. On Thursday, opposition figures dismissed the inquiry’s findings as “an effort to whitewash the killing of innocent lives”.

Set up by Mnangagwa, the inquiry found that the military and police were responsible for the deaths, but that the deployment of troops had been lawful after the police had been overwhelmed by protesters. The protests were “pre-planned and orchestrated” and leaders from the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had incited violence, the report added.

It recommended that soldiers should face “internal” disciplinary measures if found to have broken their codes of conduct.

Jacob Mafume, a spokesperson for the MDC, described the inquiry’s conclusions as “bizarre”, telling the Guardian: “They say it’s the MDC that incited violence yet blame the military for shooting the people.”

Opposition leaders have denied the charge of incitement.

The violence followed relatively peaceful elections and caused significant political difficulties for Mnangagwa’s government, which has made strenuous attempts to convince the international community that Zanu-PF has forgone the repression and brutality it was accused of during its 38 years in power under Mugabe.

The inquiry spent three months investigating the circumstances surrounding the shootings, interviewing dozens of witnesses.

Despite widely published photographs and video footage that showed members of the Zimbabwean army firing on people, generals said under oath they did not believe troops had shot at people.

Brig Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the elite presidential guard, told a hearing investigating the killings that “if any gunshot wounds were sustained by the victims, it was not from my men”.

Mnangagwa said his government would study the report before deciding on its next steps."

After the alleged assault came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity. That immunity was overturned by a court this year after Engels, a model, challenged the decision.\n\n“I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,” said Vishnu Naidoo, a spokesman for South Africa’s police service. He said police were seeking Interpol’s help to enforce the warrant.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Grace Mugabe.\n\nThe two countries have an extradition agreement, but Zimbabwe’s deputy minister for information, Energy Mutodi, told Reuters that Harare would not extradite Mugabe.\n\n“I believe the government of Zimbabwe will not tolerate any harassment or degrading treatment on the former president Mugabe and his immediate family members,” Mutodi said, adding that he would need to consult with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on a final decision.\n\nGrace Mugabe, 53, was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband, Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year.\n\nShe has denied assaulting Engels with an extension cord, saying an “intoxicated and unhinged” Engels attacked her with a knife after going to see the Mugabe’s sons at the hotel. The South African advocacy group AfriForum, which represented Engels, has accused Mugabe of lying.\n\nMugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted. Elections in August were won by Mnangagwa, his former righthand man in the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nThe warrant comes days after a long-awaited report into the killing of six people by soldiers during a post-elections protest in Harare. On Thursday, opposition figures dismissed the inquiry’s findings as “an effort to whitewash the killing of innocent lives”.\n\nSet up by Mnangagwa, the inquiry found that the military and police were responsible for the deaths, but that the deployment of troops had been lawful after the police had been overwhelmed by protesters. The protests were “pre-planned and orchestrated” and leaders from the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had incited violence, the report added.\n\nIt recommended that soldiers should face “internal” disciplinary measures if found to have broken their codes of conduct.\n\nJacob Mafume, a spokesperson for the MDC, described the inquiry’s conclusions as “bizarre”, telling the Guardian: “They say it’s the MDC that incited violence yet blame the military for shooting the people.”\n\nOpposition leaders have denied the charge of incitement.\n\nThe violence followed relatively peaceful elections and caused significant political difficulties for Mnangagwa’s government, which has made strenuous attempts to convince the international community that Zanu-PF has forgone the repression and brutality it was accused of during its 38 years in power under Mugabe.\n\nThe inquiry spent three months investigating the circumstances surrounding the shootings, interviewing dozens of witnesses.\n\nDespite widely published photographs and video footage that showed members of the Zimbabwean army firing on people, generals said under oath they did not believe troops had shot at people.\n\nBrig Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the elite presidential guard, told a hearing investigating the killings that “if any gunshot wounds were sustained by the victims, it was not from my men”.\n\nMnangagwa said his government would study the report before deciding on its next steps.', 'authorsList': ['Jason Burke'], 'description': 'Zimbabwe’s former first lady accused of assaulting woman with electrical cord in hotel', 'probability': 0.95834476, 'dateModified': '2018-12-19T19:20:02+00:00', 'datePublished': '2018-12-19T13:20:57+00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class=""css-avj6db""><div class=""article-body-commercial-selector css-79elbk""><p class=""css-38z03z"">South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabwe’s former first lady Grace Mugabe in relation to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/south-africa-plans-to-grant-immunity-to-grace-mugabe-sources-say"" data-link-name=""in body link"">an alleged assault</a> on a woman in a hotel in Johannesburg last year.</p><p class=""css-38z03z"">Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of beating the “hell out” of her with an electrical extension cord in a room at the Capital 20 West hotel in Johannesburg’s Sandton district.

101	Canberk	Conrad Black	Person	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-conrad-black-meet-the-man-pardoned-by-president-trump/	"/ MoneyWatch

Conrad Black's full pardon came a year after publishing his glowing biography, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.""
The onetime media baron was convicted of fraud and obstructing justice in a scheme blamed for taking down what was one of the world's biggest newspaper companies.
Until being bought out, Black partnered with Mr. Trump in building Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago.

The name Conrad Black may not ring a bell for some Americans, but the onetime media baron, society figure and now a recipient of a presidential pardon was in the public spotlight for years. Deported to Canada in 2012 after spending more than three years in prison, Black had been found guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. His long and colorful history includes a long-standing alliance with President Trump.

Born in Canada, Black eventually became a British lord and is described in press accounts as a millionaire who lived like a billionaire. When criticized for allegedly using shareholder money to finance a vacation to Bora Bora and charging an extravagant birthday party for his wife to his company, he reportedly declared that he would ""not re-enact the French Revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility."" He was acquitted of charges related to both incidents.

""A President Like No Other""

In his 20s, Black and longtime business partner David Radler turned an investment in an English-language daily in Quebec into a company that ran more than 300 newspapers. He became a convicted felon decades later when he and other executives were accused of looting about $32 million from Hollinger International, which owned entities including the Chicago Sun-Times, Canada's National Post, the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. Radler pleaded guilty in the scheme blamed for taking down what at the time was among the biggest newspaper companies in the world.

When Black was at the helm, the Sun-Times in the early 2000s sold its building alongside the Chicago River to Mr. Trump, leading to the present-day Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago. The two were partners in the undertaking until Mr. Trump bought out Black.

The full pardon came a day after the National Review published an essay by Black headlined: ""Smooth Sailing Ahead for Trump,"" and a year after the publication of Black's book, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other."" The 74-year-old Black has authored other presidential biographies, including ""Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full,"" in 2007.

""Mr. Black is entirely deserving"" of the pardon, the White House said in a statement. It touted him as having made ""tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought.""

16	Wanting	Correio Angolense	company	https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/cyber-attacks-on-angolan-journalists-who-reported-government-corruption-infosec-comptia-networksecurity/	"Cyber-attacks have been levied against journalists in Angola after they reported that the Angolan president’s chief of staff had embezzled public funds.

Independent online news provider Correio Angolense published an article online covering the claims against Edeltrudes Costa that were first made by the Portuguese TV channel Televisão Independente (TVI).

The broadcaster launched an investigation after companies owned by Costa were awarded several major contracts by the government, including a multi-million-dollar contract to renovate Angola’s airports. TVI alleged that Costa transferred public money paid to his businesses to offshore accounts in Panama and Portugal, then used it to acquire luxury properties.

Shortly after Correio Angolense covered the allegations, the website of the news provider was hit by a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. As a result, the website has been inaccessible since September 25.

Its editor, Graça Campos, told Reporters Without Borders (RSF) that the site was crashed by thousands of simultaneous connection attempts in what appeared to be a deliberate cyber-attack.

RSF’s former Angola correspondent, freelance journalist Siona Casimiro, was also the target of a cyber-attack after he worked on the Costa embezzlement story.

Casimiro told RSF: “There can be no doubt about the desire to silence journalists with regard to the Edeltrudes Costa affair.”

Combatting corruption has been one of President João Lourenço’s key pledges since his election in 2017. When news of Costa’s alleged crime broke, around 200 people took to the streets of the nation’s capital Luanda to protest and call for the chief of staff’s resignation.

Lourenço’s campaign against corruption led to the imprisonment in August of José Filomeno dos Santos, son of Angola’s former president José Eduardo dos Santos, who served as the country’s head of state from 1979 to 2017. José Filomeno was sentenced to five years in prison after diverting oil revenues from Angola’s sovereign wealth fund, which he oversaw from 2013 to 2018.

An investigation is ongoing into the activities of his half-sister Isabel dos Santos, who, according to Africa News, is suspected of “a long list of crimes including mismanagement, embezzlement and money laundering during her stewardship of state oil giant Sonangol.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605368825911-35b45670170d32fc', 'domain': 'nationalcybersecuritynews.today', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/cyber-attacks-on-angolan-journalists-who-reported-government-corruption-infosec-comptia-networksecurity/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/cyber-attacks-on-angolan-journalists-who-reported-government-corruption-infosec-comptia-networksecurity/', 'author': 'NCSNewsToday', 'headline': 'Cyber-attacks on Angolan Journalists Who Reported Government Corruption | #infosec | #comptia | #networksecurity', 'mainImage': 'https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0c036db1-cf55-4980-8f54-645ea0df871a.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Cyber-attacks have been levied against journalists in Angola after they reported that the Angolan president’s chief of staff had embezzled public funds.\n\nIndependent online news provider Correio Angolense published an article online covering the claims against Edeltrudes Costa that were first made by the Portuguese TV channel Televisão Independente (TVI).\n\nThe broadcaster launched an investigation after companies owned by Costa were awarded several major contracts by the government, including a multi-million-dollar contract to renovate Angola’s airports.

80	Sebastien	Jean Chrétien	individual	https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2005/02/cana-f19.html	"Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, his predecessor as head of the Liberal government, testified under oath last week at a public inquiry investigating alleged government corruption. Only once previously did a sitting or past Canadian prime minister give public testimony in a like judicial proceeding. That was in 1873, when Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, responded to charges his government had awarded a railway contract in return for massive election campaign contributions to his Conservative Party.

At Martin’s request, Justice John Gomery is investigating a federal government program under which Ottawa paid out $250 million between 1996 and 2002 to sponsor sporting and cultural events. Much of the money was funnelled through Liberal-friendly advertising firms. It is not uncommon for Canadian governments, whether federal or provincial, to steer government advertising and consultancy work to firms known to be friendly to the party in power. But in this case, internal government audits found the program improperly managed, with financial records either nonexistent or replete with errors and gaps.

A government study of contracts given to Le Groupe Polygone Editeurs, which received $40 million in sponsorship money, said that there appeared to have been “systematic and egregious overcharging for what was delivered.” A subsequent investigation by Canada’s auditor-general found repeated instances of Groupe Polygone and other firms receiving large payments in return for little or no work. Criminal charges have been laid against several advertising company executives.

There is little doubt some people criminally profited from the sponsorship program. There are also good grounds to believe that the program—whose ostensible purpose was to raise the profile of the federal government in Quebec and thereby counter the Quebec indépendantiste movement—was used to finance the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party. According to Alfonso Gagliano, who for much of this period was both the minister responsible for the sponsorship program and the boss of the Quebec Liberal machine, the Liberal Party was “not rich.” It, however, did receive substantial donations from many of the firms and executives of the firms that received sponsorship contracts from Gagliano’s Public Works Ministry or to which sponsorship work was subcontracted.

That said, the sponsorship scandal—the blaring headlines and feigned outrage of opposition politicians notwithstanding—is pretty much small potatoes. As the doyen of Canadian political journalism Peter C. Newman conceded, patronage has always been integral to the functioning of Canada’s major political parties. “Patronage,” wrote Newman in a recent op-ed piece, “is the udder of Canadian democracy. It has fuelled Canadian politics since Sir John A. Macdonald, our Founding Father, accepted bribes from would-be builders of the CPR.”

The enormous amount of air-time and ink the corporate media have devoted to the sponsorship scandal and the place it has taken in the official political debate stand in sharp contrast to the treatment accorded other cases of political corruption. Take, for example, the millions of dollars in questionable contracts that high-level operatives in the Ontario Tory government and Ontario Conservative Party were given by the province’s Crown-owned hydro companies between 1995 and 2003. As in the sponsorship scandal, many of the contracts called for little if any real work. Yet the press soon dropped the story.

And what of the revelation that Karlheinz Schreiber, a German-Canadian arms dealer whom the German government is seeking to extradite, paid former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney $300,000—in cash, in hotel rooms—shortly after he left office? Although Mulroney’s explanation—that the money was in return for the advice he gave Schreiber on a pasta-manufacturing scheme—is, to say the least, implausible, few newspapers reported on Schreiber’s payments to Mulroney. None has pursued the story.

If the sponsorship scandal has become such a major political issue, it is because it has served as a mechanism through which Canada’s corporate and political elite have fought out matters of leadership and policy direction.

The neo-conservative National Post and the official opposition Canadian Alliance—now merged with the Tories in the new Conservative Party—have long-trumpeted allegations of waste and corruption in government spending. They have done so in order to discredit their Liberal rivals and, more generally, with the aim of depicting government spending as out of control, so as to bolster their crusade for tax cuts and for “getting government off the back of Canadians” through privatization and deregulation. In this they have been inspired, if not directly advised, by the US Republicans who used a trumped-up financial scandal, Whitewater, and then the Monica Lewinsky affair to destabilize the Clinton administration and ultimately to try to unseat Clinton.

Paul Martin and his supporters in the Liberal Party and sections of the ruling class who still view the Liberals as the party best able to govern in their interests—because of residual popular illusions in the Liberals’ being a party of the “people” and because of the Liberals’ commitment to a strong federal state—also made use of the sponsorship scandal and other allegations of impropriety in pushing for Chrétien to retire.

And since the release of the auditor-general’s damning report on the sponsorship program last February, Martin and the Conservatives, to say nothing of the pro-independence Bloc Québécois, have all found it in their interest at various times to focus public attention on the sponsorship scandal, so as to avoid discussion of their own records, programs and intentions.

This choice of means is, of course, not without significance. There is great popular dissatisfaction with, and disaffection from, all the establishment parties, from the avowedly pro-big business Conservatives through the social democrats of the New Democratic Party, because they have all been party to the assault on public and social services and trade union and democratic rights. Because there is no popular constituency for big business’s program of razing what remains of the welfare state, gutting all regulatory restraints on capital, and bringing Canada into a closer economic and geo-political partnership with Wall Street and Washington, big business and its political representatives have increasingly resorted to the politics of scandal and subterfuge and to nationalist and other noxious appeals in moulding and manipulating public opinion.

From Chrétien to Martin

Jean Chrétien, in a lengthy opening statement before Justice Gomery’s inquiry, made an impassioned defence of his government’s record, arguing explicitly that his government had strengthened Canada and implicitly that he had well served the interests of Canadian big business. The Wall Street Journal, he observed, had warned shortly after he came to office that Canada was being reduced to the status of a Third World country. But his government had taken decisive action to put federal finances in order. Boasted Chrétien, “We had 10 great years when we turned it around, we took deficit to surplus, we paid the national debt.”

Indeed, in terms of socioeconomic and fiscal policy, the Chrétien Liberal government was far and away the most right-wing federal government since the Great Depression. It slashed tens of billions from health care and other public services, rewrote the rules governing Canada’s unemployment insurance program to deny benefits to the majority of the jobless, and, once the annual budget deficit was eliminated, announced a five-year, $100 billion program of corporate and personal income tax cuts skewed to benefit the rich and designed to ensure that the state lacked the resources to reinvest in public services.

Nevertheless, big business became increasingly dissatisfied with Chrétien, especially after the coming to power of the Bush administration in 2001. Chrétien’s Trudeau-era Canadian nationalism, with its streak of anti-Americanism, his reluctance to give a massive, multibillion-dollar permanent boost to the military budget, and his failure to publicly promote privatization and deregulation, were all seen as inimical to big business’s interests.

Under conditions where the bourgeoisie’s traditional alternate party of government, the Progressive Conservatives, had been reduced to a rump, the most powerful sections of Canadian business fixed on Martin—himself a multimillionaire businessman and Chrétien’s finance minister—as the best means of unseating Chrétien and shifting the government further right.

Martin was thus egged on in his campaign to seize the leadership of the Liberal Party and prime ministership, the first time a sitting prime minister was felled from within his own party. Although Martin did not directly raise the sponsorship issue during his campaign for the prime ministership, he certainly benefited by press suggestions that financial improprieties had taken place under Chrétien’s watch and alluded to the scandal with his promises of doing politics differently.

What brought the sponsorship scandal to centre-stage was Martin’s decision to fan public outrage over the auditor-general’s report castigating the program. Rather than downplaying the report’s significance, Martin declared himself mad as hell. He hailed the report’s author, Sheila Fraser, as a national hero, asserted that there must have been “political direction” behind the failure to follow normal government procedures in the awarding and administering of contracts, fired Gagliano from his post as Canada’s ambassador to Denmark, and sacked several long-time Liberals from their posts as heads of various Crown Corporations.

Invariably newspaper columnists have presented Martin’s response to the auditor-general’s report as a settling of accounts with Chrétien and his faction of the Liberal Party. Undoubtedly, personal rivalries and power struggles were involved. But Martin’s decision to champion the sponsorship scandal was also rooted in his anxiousness to demonstrate to big business that his government was a new regime, not a continuation of the Chrétien Liberal government.

Martin’s first actions on taking office all signalled a shift to the right. He announced an immediate review of all government spending and a freeze on recently announced expenditures. He stressed his intention to mend fences with the Bush administration and, after an initial get-acquainted meeting with Bush, declared that any differences between the US and Canadian governments over the Iraq war were now history.

The need to seek a popular mandate constrained Martin, however, from fully satisfying business’s demand for a sharp shift to the right, especially in the form of a new round of tax cuts, the gutting of Canada’s Kyoto Accord commitments, and a closer partnership with the US. He and his aides decided instead to amplify the sponsorship scandal, so as to demonstrate, pending a spring election, that a new team with different ideas was in power.

The ruse failed. Martin apparently believed the media hype about his being Canada’s most popular political leader and his unique bond with Canadians. But his trumpeting of the sponsorship scandal sent Liberal polling numbers into freefall.

The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois, meanwhile, fastened onto the sponsorship scandal. Both parties made the purported fight against corruption in government the centrepiece of their campaigns for the June 30 federal election. For the Conservatives, the denunciations of Liberal corruption served as means of deflecting popular attention from their right-wing program and party leader Stephen Harper’s record as a neo-conservative ideologue.

The election left the Liberals clinging to power, more than 20 seats short of a majority of in the House of Commons. Moreover, Martin’s room for maneuver was further reduced by the large increase in votes for parties that portray themselves as left-wing opponents of the two major parties, the New Democratic Party, Bloc Québécois and Greens.

Chrétien and Martin before the commission

Chrétien was the first of the two Liberal Party leaders to appear before the Gomery Commission. He ceded nothing to his critics, insisting that the sponsorship program had been an essential part of the federal government’s strategy to fight Quebec separatism, and made his disdain for the commission clear to all.

Earlier Chrétien’s lawyers had pressed for Judge Gomery to step down as inquiry head, arguing that comments Gomery made to the press in December that were critical of Chrétien showed that he had prejudged the case and that his appointment of Bernard Roy, one of the closest associates of Brian Mulroney, as the commission’s lead lawyer indicated bias. (Roy was best man at Mulroney’s wedding, later served as his chief of staff, and currently works for the same law firm as Mulroney.)

Chrétien concluded his testimony with a farcical piece of courtroom drama meant to underline his contempt for the proceedings. He answered Gomery’s quip that the government’s purchase of golf balls with his signature imprinted on them was “small-town cheap” by pulling from his pocket golf balls he had received from Presidents Bush and Clinton bearing their imprinted signatures, as well as one produced for the law firm at which Mulroney and Bernard Roy now work.

While Chrétien and the commission had their daggers drawn, Justice Gomery and the commission’s lawyers gave Martin every opportunity to get out his message that he knew nothing of the details of the sponsorship program, because he was preoccupied with his duties as finance minister, and because Chrétien and his aides made sure that he had no role in managing the Quebec Liberal machine. Observing that it was “rather rare” for a prime minister to testify before a public inquiry, government lawyer Sylvain Lussier concluded his questioning of Martin by asking, “Is this an indication of how seriously you take the commission?”

The press reaction to Chrétien’s and Martin’s testimony is more significant than the scripted lines they delivered during their respective appearances. While many newspaper columnists and editorial writers insisted that Chrétien has much to answer for, there was a grudging admiration for his grit and political smarts.

The press was all but unanimous that Martin should be taken at his word. But even as it exonerated the prime minister of all blame for the sponsorship program, the press chastised him for his earnest, long-winded answers and tied this to sharp criticisms of his failure to “show leadership.” By this, they mean his reluctance to court unpopularity by taking decisions, like signing Canada on to the US missile defence program, strongly supported by the corporate and political elite.

Only a short time ago, the corporate elite was fixated on the need to replace Chrétien. Now, his successor Martin is being derided as indecisive. According to the Economist, Martin’s “faltering leadership has earned him the sobriquet of ‘Mr. Dithers’.”

Yet the most powerful sections of the bourgeoisie have little confidence in the Conservatives under Harper as an alternative. They remain concerned about Harper’s strong identification with the demands of Western-based business and political interests for a greater share of political power and are aghast over his crude appeals to religious conservatism—he has said gay marriage could be the first step toward the Liberals sanctioning polygamy—and over his failure to vigorously promote business’s neo-liberal agenda or offer Martin the Conservatives’ support on missile defence.

Even the National Post dismissed Harper’s claim that Martin wasn’t ready to stand behind the Gomery inquiry, when Chrétien sought to force the judge to step down, as “posturing,” adding that Harper’s “Conservative Party remains very much a work in progress.”

Canada’s corporate and political elite perceives itself to be falling behind in the global struggle for markets and profits and geo-political advantage and is increasingly frustrated at its inability to sideline public opposition to its drive for more tax cuts, the gutting of Medicare and other public services, the building up of the Canadian armed forces, and full Canadian participation in a Fortress America. This malaise has found expression in the hullabaloo over the sponsorship scandal.

The bourgeoisie, however, has numerous mechanisms, economic and political, to spur its political representatives rightward, manipulate public opinion and deflect and smother opposition—not least the trade unions and the NDP.

The opposition of working people remains inchoate and largely latent. It will only find coherent, progressive political expression through the struggle for a new political orientation—the mobilization of the working class as an independent and international class against the profit system."

Only once previously did a sitting or past Canadian prime minister give public testimony in a like judicial proceeding. That was in 1873, when Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, responded to charges his government had awarded a railway contract in return for massive election campaign contributions to his Conservative Party.</p>    <p>At Martin’s request, Justice John Gomery is investigating a federal government program under which Ottawa paid out $250 million between 1996 and 2002 to sponsor sporting and cultural events. Much of the money was funnelled through Liberal-friendly advertising firms. It is not uncommon for Canadian governments, whether federal or provincial, to steer government advertising and consultancy work to firms known to be friendly to the party in power. But in this case, internal government audits found the program improperly managed, with financial records either nonexistent or replete with errors and gaps.</p>    <p>A government study of contracts given to Le Groupe Polygone Editeurs, which received $40 million in sponsorship money, said that there appeared to have been “systematic and egregious overcharging for what was delivered.” A subsequent investigation by Canada’s auditor-general found repeated instances of Groupe Polygone and other firms receiving large payments in return for little or no work. Criminal charges have been laid against several advertising company executives.</p>    <p>There is little doubt some people criminally profited from the sponsorship program. There are also good grounds to believe that the program—whose ostensible purpose was to raise the profile of the federal government in Quebec and thereby counter the Quebec <em>indépendantiste</em> movement—was used to finance the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party. According to Alfonso Gagliano, who for much of this period was both the minister responsible for the sponsorship program and the boss of the Quebec Liberal machine, the Liberal Party was “not rich.” It, however, did receive substantial donations from many of the firms and executives of the firms that received sponsorship contracts from Gagliano’s Public Works Ministry or to which sponsorship work was subcontracted.</p>    <p>That said, the sponsorship scandal—the blaring headlines and feigned outrage of opposition politicians notwithstanding—is pretty much small potatoes. As the doyen of Canadian political journalism Peter C. Newman conceded, patronage has always been integral to the functioning of Canada’s major political parties. “Patronage,” wrote Newman in a recent op-ed piece, “is the udder of Canadian democracy. It has fuelled Canadian politics since Sir John A. Macdonald, our Founding Father, accepted bribes from would-be builders of the CPR.”</p>    <p>The enormous amount of air-time and ink the corporate media have devoted to the sponsorship scandal and the place it has taken in the official political debate stand in sharp contrast to the treatment accorded other cases of political corruption. Take, for example, the millions of dollars in questionable contracts that high-level operatives in the Ontario Tory government and Ontario Conservative Party were given by the province’s Crown-owned hydro companies between 1995 and 2003. As in the sponsorship scandal, many of the contracts called for little if any real work. Yet the press soon dropped the story.</p>    <p>And what of the revelation that Karlheinz Schreiber, a German-Canadian arms dealer whom the German government is seeking to extradite, paid former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney $300,000—in cash, in hotel rooms—shortly after he left office? Although Mulroney’s explanation—that the money was in return for the advice he gave Schreiber on a pasta-manufacturing scheme—is, to say the least, implausible, few newspapers reported on Schreiber’s payments to Mulroney. None has pursued the story.</p>    <p>If the sponsorship scandal has become such a major political issue, it is because it has served as a mechanism through which Canada’s corporate and political elite have fought out matters of leadership and policy direction.</p>    <p>The neo-conservative <em>National Post</em> and the official opposition Canadian Alliance—now merged with the Tories in the new Conservative Party—have long-trumpeted allegations of waste and corruption in government spending. They have done so in order to discredit their Liberal rivals and, more generally, with the aim of depicting government spending as out of control, so as to bolster their crusade for tax cuts and for “getting government off the back of Canadians” through privatization and deregulation. In this they have been inspired, if not directly advised, by the US Republicans who used a trumped-up financial scandal, Whitewater, and then the Monica Lewinsky affair to destabilize the Clinton administration and ultimately to try to unseat Clinton.</p>    <p>Paul Martin and his supporters in the Liberal Party and sections of the ruling class who still view the Liberals as the party best able to govern in their interests—because of residual popular illusions in the Liberals’ being a party of the “people” and because of the Liberals’ commitment to a strong federal state—also made use of the sponsorship scandal and other allegations of impropriety in pushing for Chrétien to retire.</p>    <p>And since the release of the auditor-general’s damning report on the sponsorship program last February, Martin and the Conservatives, to say nothing of the pro-independence Bloc Québécois, have all found it in their interest at various times to focus public attention on the sponsorship scandal, so as to avoid discussion of their own records, programs and intentions.</p>    <p>This choice of means is, of course, not without significance. There is great popular dissatisfaction with, and disaffection from, all the establishment parties, from the avowedly pro-big business Conservatives through the social democrats of the New Democratic Party, because they have all been party to the assault on public and social services and trade union and democratic rights. Because there is no popular constituency for big business’s program of razing what remains of the welfare state, gutting all regulatory restraints on capital, and bringing Canada into a closer economic and geo-political partnership with Wall Street and Washington, big business and its political representatives have increasingly resorted to the politics of scandal and subterfuge and to nationalist and other noxious appeals in moulding and manipulating public opinion.</p><strong>From Chrétien to Martin</strong><br><aside data-track-content=""true"" data-content-name=""33% of article"" data-content-piece=""/en/articles/2005/02/cana-f19.html""></aside>    <p>Jean Chrétien, in a lengthy opening statement before Justice Gomery’s inquiry, made an impassioned defence of his government’s record, arguing explicitly that his government had strengthened Canada and implicitly that he had well served the interests of Canadian big business. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, he observed, had warned shortly after he came to office that Canada was being reduced to the status of a Third World country. But his government had taken decisive action to put federal finances in order. Boasted Chrétien, “We had 10 great years when we turned it around, we took deficit to surplus, we paid the national debt.”</p>    <p>Indeed, in terms of socioeconomic and fiscal policy, the Chrétien Liberal government was far and away the most right-wing federal government since the Great Depression. It slashed tens of billions from health care and other public services, rewrote the rules governing Canada’s unemployment insurance program to deny benefits to the majority of the jobless, and, once the annual budget deficit was eliminated, announced a five-year, $100 billion program of corporate and personal income tax cuts skewed to benefit the rich and designed to ensure that the state lacked the resources to reinvest in public services.</p>    <p>Nevertheless, big business became increasingly dissatisfied with Chrétien, especially after the coming to power of the Bush administration in 2001. Chrétien’s Trudeau-era Canadian nationalism, with its streak of anti-Americanism, his reluctance to give a massive, multibillion-dollar permanent boost to the military budget, and his failure to publicly promote privatization and deregulation, were all seen as inimical to big business’s interests.</p>    <p>Under conditions where the bourgeoisie’s traditional alternate party of government, the Progressive Conservatives, had been reduced to a rump, the most powerful sections of Canadian business fixed on Martin—himself a multimillionaire businessman and Chrétien’s finance minister—as the best means of unseating Chrétien and shifting the government further right.</p>    <p>Martin was thus egged on in his campaign to seize the leadership of the Liberal Party and prime ministership, the first time a sitting prime minister was felled from within his own party. Although Martin did not directly raise the sponsorship issue during his campaign for the prime ministership, he certainly benefited by press suggestions that financial improprieties had taken place under Chrétien’s watch and alluded to the scandal with his promises of doing politics differently.</p>    <p>What brought the sponsorship scandal to centre-stage was Martin’s decision to fan public outrage over the auditor-general’s report castigating the program. Rather than downplaying the report’s significance, Martin declared himself mad as hell. He hailed the report’s author, Sheila Fraser, as a national hero, asserted that there must have been “political direction” behind the failure to follow normal government procedures in the awarding and administering of contracts, fired Gagliano from his post as Canada’s ambassador to Denmark, and sacked several long-time Liberals from their posts as heads of various Crown Corporations.</p>    <p>Invariably newspaper columnists have presented Martin’s response to the auditor-general’s report as a settling of accounts with Chrétien and his faction of the Liberal Party. Undoubtedly, personal rivalries and power struggles were involved. But Martin’s decision to champion the sponsorship scandal was also rooted in his anxiousness to demonstrate to big business that his government was a new regime, not a continuation of the Chrétien Liberal government.</p>    <p>Martin’s first actions on taking office all signalled a shift to the right. He announced an immediate review of all government spending and a freeze on recently announced expenditures. He stressed his intention to mend fences with the Bush administration and, after an initial get-acquainted meeting with Bush, declared that any differences between the US and Canadian governments over the Iraq war were now history.</p>    <p>The need to seek a popular mandate constrained Martin, however, from fully satisfying business’s demand for a sharp shift to the right, especially in the form of a new round of tax cuts, the gutting of Canada’s Kyoto Accord commitments, and a closer partnership with the US. He and his aides decided instead to amplify the sponsorship scandal, so as to demonstrate, pending a spring election, that a new team with different ideas was in power.</p>    <p>The ruse failed. Martin apparently believed the media hype about his being Canada’s most popular political leader and his unique bond with Canadians. But his trumpeting of the sponsorship scandal sent Liberal polling numbers into freefall.</p>    <p>The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois, meanwhile, fastened onto the sponsorship scandal. Both parties made the purported fight against corruption in government the centrepiece of their campaigns for the June 30 federal election. For the Conservatives, the denunciations of Liberal corruption served as means of deflecting popular attention from their right-wing program and party leader Stephen Harper’s record as a neo-conservative ideologue.</p>    <p>The election left the Liberals clinging to power, more than 20 seats short of a majority of in the House of Commons. Moreover, Martin’s room for maneuver was further reduced by the large increase in votes for parties that portray themselves as left-wing opponents of the two major parties, the New Democratic Party, Bloc Québécois and Greens.</p><strong>Chrétien and Martin before the commission</strong><aside data-track-content=""true"" data-content-name=""66% of article"" data-content-piece=""/en/articles/2005/02/cana-f19.html""></aside><br>    <p>Chrétien was the first of the two Liberal Party leaders to appear before the Gomery Commission.

While many newspaper columnists and editorial writers insisted that Chrétien has much to answer for, there was a grudging admiration for his grit and political smarts.</p>\n\n<p>The press was all but unanimous that Martin should be taken at his word. But even as it exonerated the prime minister of all blame for the sponsorship program, the press chastised him for his earnest, long-winded answers and tied this to sharp criticisms of his failure to “show leadership.” By this, they mean his reluctance to court unpopularity by taking decisions, like signing Canada on to the US missile defence program, strongly supported by the corporate and political elite.</p>\n\n<p>Only a short time ago, the corporate elite was fixated on the need to replace Chrétien. Now, his successor Martin is being derided as indecisive. According to the <em>Economist</em>, Martin’s “faltering leadership has earned him the sobriquet of ‘Mr. Dithers’.”</p>\n\n<p>Yet the most powerful sections of the bourgeoisie have little confidence in the Conservatives under Harper as an alternative. They remain concerned about Harper’s strong identification with the demands of Western-based business and political interests for a greater share of political power and are aghast over his crude appeals to religious conservatism—he has said gay marriage could be the first step toward the Liberals sanctioning polygamy—and over his failure to vigorously promote business’s neo-liberal agenda or offer Martin the Conservatives’ support on missile defence.</p>\n\n<p>Even the <em>National Post</em> dismissed Harper’s claim that Martin wasn’t ready to stand behind the Gomery inquiry, when Chrétien sought to force the judge to step down, as “posturing,” adding that Harper’s “Conservative Party remains very much a work in progress.”</p>\n\n<p>Canada’s corporate and political elite perceives itself to be falling behind in the global struggle for markets and profits and geo-political advantage and is increasingly frustrated at its inability to sideline public opposition to its drive for more tax cuts, the gutting of Medicare and other public services, the building up of the Canadian armed forces, and full Canadian participation in a Fortress America. This malaise has found expression in the hullabaloo over the sponsorship scandal.</p>\n\n<p>The bourgeoisie, however, has numerous mechanisms, economic and political, to spur its political representatives rightward, manipulate public opinion and deflect and smother opposition—not least the trade unions and the NDP.</p>\n\n<p>The opposition of working people remains inchoate and largely latent. It will only find coherent, progressive political expression through the struggle for a new political orientation—the mobilization of the working class as an independent and international class against the profit system.</p>\n\n</article>', 'datePublishedRaw': '19 February 2005'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	0	corruption	Darya		Canada: Martin and Chrétien testify in corruption scandal

But there’s room for hope: 86.3 percent of interviewees stressed that paying a bribe as unjustifiable, according to the same survey. In recent years Latin Americans have increasingly demanded more accountable, open and transparent governments that can readily respond to citizens’ needs. In this context, adopting transparency and accountability practices and mechanisms are essential create trust, dialogue and cooperation between institutions, private sector and civil society. These are necessary steps to boost institutions and public authorities’ legitimacy.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Latin America and the Caribbean has been enhancing the capacity of governments, civil society and the private sector in designing and implementing tools to improve transparency and accountability—essential for the region’s democratic governance.

The new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and in particularly SDG 16, explicitly link good governance with peace, justice and inclusive societies, emphasizing crisis prevention mechanisms and transparency as crucial steps for strong institutions. Empowering and promoting citizen participation is key. In our region we particularly focus on youth, women, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants, who—in spite of the progress—still lag behind, including in terms of political participation.But there are some innovative initiatives out there.For example, in Colombia, UNDP has supported the construction process of the Comprehensive Anti-Corruption Public Policy, in order to strengthen the tools and mechanisms to prevent, investigate and punish corruption. Working at a local level – or with a “territorial policy approach”— we have partnered with 12 regional departments, working with state and non-stake actors to include the population in decision-making processes.

Haiti UNDP has supported the School for the Judiciary by training 190 judges— including from the Electoral Court, Justices of the Peace and Government Commissions—to enhance skills, share best practices from other countries in the region and establish links and networks for South-South Cooperation.
Peru UNDP has a Transparency and Ethics in Public Institutions initiative with the Peruvian Press Council which encourages institutions at all government levels to comply with the Transparency and Access to Information Law. We train officials, promote citizen oversight and accountability. This project is conducted with special emphasis on Municipalities and Regional Governments to introduce the concepts and practices of open government, which encourages that citizens access documents and government proceeding, enabling effective public oversight, among other matters.
Costa Rica, our “Transparency and Accountability in the Associations of Rural Water Supply” initiative has influenced the management of drinking water and sanitation at the local level, with results seen in several communities, which now also abide to guidelines on participation, transparency and accountability. The initiative stems from UNDP’s Water Governance Facility partnership with the Stockholm International Water Institute and has led to a new implementation plan that has helped authorities apply guidelines, train staff and managers at the local and national levels with improved water management.
Chile, UNDP has supported the Commissions of Ethics and Transparency in the upper and lower houses of parliament by designing a model that improves integration, functions and procedures. Civil society has been involved in decision-making mechanisms, joining such commission and including proposals to promote integrity and transparency, as was the case of the Constitutional Act of Congress bill. This Chile-UNDP initiative was highlighted as a best practice during the Open Government Partnership Global Summit held in Mexico in October.

These examples show that countries have been advancing to adopt and promote laws and public policies that are crucial to fight corruption in crucial sectors for sustainable development.

But let’s start with transparency and accountability
124	Canberk	India	Company	https://www.civilserviceindia.com/subject/General-Studies/notes/money-laundering-and-its-prevention.html	"India is extensively gripped under crime of money laundering. Money laundering is usually used by criminals to hide money made through illegal act. It is the process by which huge amount of money obtained unlawfully, from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other severe crimes. Money laundering has an unfavourable impact on economy and political steadiness of nation. It is necessary that all nations of the world must jointly device policies and adopt measures to curb act of money laundering by resorting to forceful enforcement of law.

Generally people consider Money laundering is the conversion of black money into white money. This takes one back to cleaning the huge piles of cash. If it is done successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and ultimately to provide an authentic cover for their source of income. Money laundering fulfils the ambitions of the drug trafficker, the terrorist, the organized criminal, the insider dealer, the tax evader as well as the many other groups who need to avoid the kind of attention from the authorities that unexpected prosperity comes from illegal acts. These criminal tries to get money and power through criminal activities and then attempt to penetrate the legitimate society, thereby misrepresenting the terms of the compact. They create huge amount of money for the members of the enterprise and permit their associates to live extravagant lifestyles.

Concept of Money Laundering: Money laundering is designated as the source of illegally obtained funds covered through a series of transfers and deals in order that those same funds can eventually be made to appear as legitimate income (Robinson). According to Interpol General Secretariat Assembly in 1995, money laundering is any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.

Money Laundering is an expression that has recent origin. Money laundering is a cultured crime that is not to be taken seriously by society. When comparing with street crimes, it is a modern crime. Some experts refer to it as a victimless crime but in reality, it is not a crime against a particular individual, but it is a crime against nations, economies government, rule of law and world at large. Money laundering has become a worldwide threat. The objective of a huge number of criminal acts is to get profit for the individual or group that performed the act and then hide either the source or the purpose of cash. Money laundering is the processing of these criminal proceeds to cover their illegal origin. This process is very crucial for government and other responsible authorities as it enables the criminal to enjoy money obtained from illegal source. Some of the crimes such as illegal arms sales, smuggling, corruption, drug trafficking and the activities of organized crime including tax evasion produce huge money. Insider trading, corruption and computer fraud schemes also generate more profits and create the incentive to legitimize the illegal gains through money laundering. When a criminal activity produces large profits, the individual or group involved must find a way to control the funds without attracting attention to the original activity or the persons involved. Criminals perform this by disguising the sources, changing the form, or transferring money to a place where they are less likely to attract attention. Otherwise, they will not be able to use the money because it would connect them to the criminal action, and law enforcement authorities would grab it. If criminals perform this process successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and eventually to provide a legitimate cover for their source of income. Where criminals are allowed to use the proceeds of crime, the ability to launder such proceeds makes crime more attractive.

Significance of Money Laundering: Money laundering is an important criminal issue for policy makers and government authorities that gained increasing significance after the occurrence of heart throbbing indents of 9/11 attack on the twin towers in the U.S. After that all nations has focused its attention on the notion of money laundering and has recognized it as a source of the funding of terrorist actions. The process of globalization and advancements of the communications have made crime increasingly international in scope, and the financial aspects of crime have become more complex due to technology enhancement. The huge expansion of international banks all over the world has facilitated the transmission and the disguising of the origin of funds. This may have shocking social consequences and poses a threat to the security of any nation at large or small scale. It offers immense facilities for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and all types of criminals to operate and increase their criminal activities. Laundering enables criminal activity to continue. Money laundering causes an alteration of resources to less productive areas of the economy which in turn deceases economic development. If security authorities and government ignore this crime, there will be serious consequences on social and political development of nation. The economic and political influence of criminal organizations can deteriorate the social fabric, collective ethical standards, and eventually the democratic institutions of civilisation.

Theoretical review of money laundering: It has been demonstrated in academic reports that financial institutions have made efforts to detect and prevent money laundering since last many years, but the main feature of money laundering are its processes in which it is carried out. Many experts have argued that money laundering does not take a singular act but takes a more complex operation, which is completed in three basic steps which include placement, layering and integration (Anon, 2006). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2001: 7-8) defined money laundering as being the ""transferring (of) illegally obtained money or investments through an outside party to conceal the true source"". In South Africa, the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (2003), stated that money laundering is defined in local legislation as being ""virtually every act or transaction that involves the proceeds of crimes, including the spending of funds that were obtained illegally"". There are variation in views of different authorities to explain the notion of money laundering.

Processes of Money Laundering

Placement: First step is the Placement stage in the money laundering cycle. Money laundering activities is usually generated from cash intensive business, large amount of cash or hard currency and grown from illegal activities such as sale of drugs, illegal firearms, prostitution or human trafficking. Currencies gained from this cycle need to be disposed of immediately by the launderer, so they go as far as depositing it back in financial institutions, spending in retail economy, and involvement in a business or acquisition of an expensive property/asset or smuggled out of the country. The launderer's intention in this stage is to eliminate the cash from the place of possession so as to escape any form of detection from the authorities and to transform it to other form of assets such as travellers' cheques. Temple (2002) delineated some of the more common ways in which placement could be achieved, such as exchanging currency for smaller denominations that will make it easier to utilise, transport or conceal to methods involving the use of multiple deposits entailing small amounts in different bank accounts. Nixon (2000) refers to the practice of utilising multiple deposits being placed in many accounts by different individuals as ""smurfing"". Moulette (1995) recognised other strategies such as use of representative offices of foreign banks, international ""houses"" or ""sub accounts"" that may be maintained by banks on behalf of their clients for the funnelling of funds through casino's or unregulated Asian games such as Pai-Gow.

Layering: In this stage, the launderer tries to hide or disguise the origin of the funds by creating complicated layers of financial transactions designed to cover the audit trail and conceal it. Banerjee (2003) stated that layering serves to hide the source and ownership of the funds. Moulette (2000) suggested the methods used to accomplish layering such as the use of offset accounts by dealers, online electronic fund transfers between certain tax havens, and doubtful gold transactions in which large purchases of gold in countries with low VAT rates and then (there is an) exporting (of) the bullion back to the country of origin"". The aim of layering is to separate the illegal duties from the source of the crime, layers upon layers of transactions are created, moving illegal funds between accounts or business, or buying and selling assets on a local and international basis until the original source of the money is undetectable. Suter (2003) designated that there are other methods that can be adopted to allow, layering to take place that involve the over-invoicing and false invoicing of imports and exports.

Integration: After the layering stage, illegal funds are taken back into the financial system as payments for services rendered. Making the launderer feel fulfilled by making the funds appear to be legally earned. Illegal funds is returned to the economy and disguised as genuine income. Schroeder (2001) indicated that the techniques adopted to successfully integrate funds from a criminal enterprise would very often be similar to that of practices adopted by legitimate business.

Impact of money laundering on nation: There are many dangerous impact of money laundering on country as well as whole world. According to McDowell and Novis (2001), there are following key effects of money laundering:

Undermining of the legitimate private sector: Quirk (1997 : 7-9) stated that The use of front companies by money launderers undermines the legitimate private sector, as the motive of money launderers is not necessarily to make a profit out of operations of the front company.
Undermining of the integrity of financial markets: The succeeding reputational loss by financial institutions results in a loss of confidence by consumers in these affected financial institutions who may be perceived to be involved in fraudulent activities. This could also affect the reputation of a country and force investors to invest in economies that are perceived to be less exposed to the risk of money laundering. Money laundering can deleteriously impact on the truthfulness of financial markets, and also weaken the reputation of a nation.
Loss of control of economic policy: Reports of IMF (2003) signified that the size of the funds being laundered, and the fact that money launderers would want to launder their funds through developing economies to reduce possible detection of their schemes, can affect the inflow and outflow of funds in these countries.
Economic distortion and instability: Money laundering may also misrepresent capital flows, and thus destabilise the effective functioning of the world-wide economy. Castle and Lee (1999) argued that money launderers would not look at where to best invest their money based on economic principles, but rather at where it would be easier to avoid being caught or based on where the cost of avoidance was lower.
Loss of revenue: Many theorists such as Kovacevic (2002) and Fundanga (2003) stated that money laundering decreases the tax funds available for collection in the economy and by implication government's revenues. Consequently, governments may have to levy higher taxes in order to obtain the funds necessary to fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens.
Security threats to privatisation efforts: According to Chossudovsky (1999), it was observed that money launderers who are able to obtain previous government entities that are being privatised, can attempt to establish a legitimate front to launder funds. This can weaken economic reforms as money launders are not interested in operating these entities as going concerns, but rather as a channel for laundering money.
Reputation risk: Van Fossen (2003) asserted that nations that are competing as destinations for legitimate investments may face difficulty to do so if there is a perception that the country has a poor track record of dealing with money laundering or is seen to be a centre for money laundering. This is because legitimate investors are wary of being associated with any country that has a negative reputation.

Other impacts of money laundering are as follows:

Increased criminality: The increase in criminality is serious effect and a matter of concern in money laundering. The triumph of money launderers is the distance they create between themselves and the criminal activity producing profit, so that they can live lavish life could through this crime without attracting attention and could also go to the extent of reinvesting their profits to finance other crimes. Therefore, government, legislative act and other enforcing laws must implement policies in legal procedure to curb the crime.

Social effect: Committing crime of money laundering transfers of economic power from the right people to the wrong. The good citizens and the government are dispossessed from their right, making the criminals take the benefit to flourish in their criminality. Money laundering damages the financial institution which is an important factor in the economic development of nation.

In developing countries where there is no strict control, the governments have to seek further contribution from good citizens, making people suffer more and continue to be subject to poverty. Companies cannot compete with operators financed by illegal funding, labours then become jobless and the high rate of unemployment result in an increase in criminality, dissatisfaction and insecurity. The burden on the government would then increase with the need to provide security therefore reallocating resources from more productive enterprise to other areas. This reduces productivity in the real sector of the economy by diverting resources from productive areas to social sectors; crime and corruption which are on the increase would then slow down economic growth and decrease human development.

Microeconomics effect: Money launderers generate and make use of companies that front for them. These companies are not interested in and but pretend to be involved in them. Usually the companies are not doing any serious business. The income generated from the company is not usually from the business but from their criminal activities. Their decisions are not usually based on economic considerations and would offer products at prices below cost price making the front companies have an unjustified competitive advantage. Legitimate businesses lose when competing, as there is no fair competition involved and results in business closures due to crowding out effect of private sector business by criminal organisations.

Macroeconomic effect: There are numerous impacts of money laundering on the macroeconomic situations. These include volatility in exchange rates and interest rates due to unanticipated transfers of funds; fall in asset price due to the disposition of laundered funds; misallocation of resources in relative asset commodity prices arising from money laundering activities; loss of confidence in markets caused by insider trading, fraud and embezzlement. When businesses make less revenue and pay fewer taxes, people become unemployed and dependent on social assistance which is most times difficult to get in developing countries. When criminals use financial institution for laundering funds, this creates negative promotional and it's enough to scare banks into striving to keep criminals away from their terrain. Also banks have a risk of performing a balancing act between attracting new business and complying with the regulations and legislations. The securities markets (especially derivatives) have become the attention of money launderers and are posing an added risk to financial systems. Other indirect economic effects are higher insurance premiums for those who do not make fraudulent claims and higher costs to businesses therefore generating fewer profits which make it difficult to break even. According to Reilly (2008), money laundering has the ability to infiltrate the global financial system and also change economic data. Quirk (1997) in Reilly et al (2008) stated that money demand can appear to change from one country to another resulting in deceptive financial data. Income distribution also tends to be affected by money laundering because it could be redistributed from high savers to low ones, sound investments to risky ones. Due to such negative impact, policy makers have to face difficulty to devise effective responses to monetary threats and it causes difficulties in the government efforts to manage economic strategy. Sensible risks are prone to affect the reliability of banks and the management of economic policies. The prudential risk might be as a result of the corruption of the bank manager, when he/she begins to accept large sum of money from launders and this brings about non-market behaviour in the financial system. Steel (2006) affirmed that financial institutions are regarded as organizations that provide financial services to its customers or members, leaving them at the front position in the battle against money launderers. Financial institutions are not the only target the launderers use in their various schemes but they are accountable for financial dealings and for reporting any doubtful transactions.

It has been cleared that the Money laundering has negative consequences on monetary development. Money laundering constitutes a serious risk to national economies and respective governments. The penetration and sometimes saturation of illicit money into legitimate financial sectors and nations accounts can intimidate economic and political constancy. Economic crimes have a disturbing effect on a national economy since potential victims of such crimes are far more numerous than those in other forms of crime. Economic crimes also have the potential of unfavourably affecting people who do not prima-facie, seem to be the victims of the crime. For example, tax evasion results in forfeiture of government income and in turn affecting the potential of the government to spend on development schemes thereby affecting a large section of the population who could have benefited from such government expenditure. A company fraud not only results in cheating of the people who have invested in that company but may also adversely affects investors' confidence and eventually the development of the economy. Legislature body has difficulty to quantify the negative economic effects of money laundering on economic development. Such activity damages the financial-sector institutions that are critical to economic growth, reduces productivity in the economy's real sector by diverting resources and encouraging crime and corruption, which slow economic growth, and can distort the economy's external sector international trade and capital flows to the detriment of long-term economic development.

The Financial Sector: Financial sector may get negative effects of money laundering particularly financial institutions including banking and non-banking financial institutions and equity markets, may directly or indirectly be affected. Basically, these institutions facilitate concentration of capital resources from domestic savings and funds from overseas. These institutions provide impetus to furtherance of investment prospects by providing conducive environment and efficient allocation of these resources to investment projects which contributes substantially to long run economic growth.

Reports signify that Money Laundering weakens the sustainability and development of financial institutions in two ways.

Firstly, the financial institutions are debilitated directly through money laundering as there seems to be an association between money laundering and fraudulent activities undertaken by employees of the institutions. Likewise, with the rise in money laundering acts, major parts of financial institutions of a state are susceptible to crime by criminal elements. This strengthens the criminals of money laundering channels. This may lead to the removal of less equipped competitors and giving rise to domination.

Secondly, customer trust is important to the development of comprehensive financial institutions, and the perceived risk to the growth of sound financial institutions, and the perceived risk to depositors and investors from institutional fraud and corruption. The Real Sector Money laundering harmfully affects economic development through the real sector by diverting resources to less productive activities and by facilitating domestic corruption and crime.

Money laundering also performed through the channels other than financial institutions that includes more sterile investments such as real estate, art, antiques, jewellery and luxury automobiles, or investments of the type that gives lower marginal productivity in an economy. These sub optimal allocations of resource give lower level of economic growth which is a serious disadvantage to economic progress for developing countries. Criminals invest their proceeds in companies and real estate in order to make further profits, legal or illegal. Most of these investments are in sectors that are familiar to the criminal, such as bar, restaurant, prostitution. The real estate sector is the largest and most susceptible sector for money laundering. Real estate is important for money laundering, because it is a non-transparent market where the values of the objects are often difficult for approximation and it is an efficient way to place large amounts of money. The price increase in real estate is lucrative and the annual profits on real business create a legal basis for income. The real estate has the following characteristics for criminal money:

A safe investment
The objective value is difficult to assess.
It allows to realize ""white"" returns.

The External Sector: Money laundering activities may weaken the financial growth of any nation through the trade and international capital flows. Excessive illegal capital flight from a state may be facilitated by either domestic financial institutions or by foreign financial institutions. That illicit capital flight drains scarce resources specially from developing economies. In this way, economic growth of corresponding economy is adversely affected. Money laundering negatively affects trust of local citizens in their own domestic financial institutions as well as trust of foreign investors and financial institutions in a state's financial institution which ultimately contributes to economic growth. Money laundering channels may also be related with distortions of a country's' imports and exports. As with the participation of criminal elements on the import side, they may use illegal proceeds to purchase imported luxury goods, either with laundered funds or as part of the process of laundering such funds. Such imports do not produce domestic economic activity or employment, and in some cases can theatrically reduce domestic prices, thus reducing the productivity of domestic enterprises. The reliability of the banking and financial services market place depends mainly on the perception that it functions within a framework of high legal, professional and ethical standards. A reputation for integrity is most valuable assets of a financial institution. Dangers for the reputation can happen when a country purposely declares to want to attract 'criminal money. If funds from criminal activity can be easily processed through a particular institution, either because its employees have been bribed or because the institution do not pay attention to the criminal nature of such funds, the institution could be drawn into active complicity with criminals and become part of the criminal system itself. Such network will damage the attitudes of other financial intermediaries and of regulatory authorities as well as ordinary customers.

Money laundering has other dangerous consequences also. It not only impends the financial system of nation by taking away command of the economic policy from the government, but also declines the moral and social position of the society by exposing it to activities such as drug trafficking, smuggling, corruption and other criminal activities. The Global Sector Money Laundering has become a world-wide problem. Criminals target foreign authority with liberal bank secrecy laws and feeble anti-money laundering regulatory governments as they transfer illegal funds through domestic and international financial institutions often with the speed and internet transactions. This huge penetration of criminal proceeds into world market can destabilize and can have a debasing effect on those who work within the market system. The infiltration of criminals into the genuine markets can also change the balance of economic power from responsible and responsive entities to scoundrel agents who have no political or social responsibility.

Prevention and Combat Of Money Laundering

Legislators around the world have realized that concentrated efforts are required to deal with illegal funding and control money laundering.

India has different laws to tackle smuggling, narcotics, foreign trade violations, foreign exchange manipulations and also special legal provisions for preventive detention and forfeiture of property, which were enacted over a period of time to deal with such severe crimes. Some of these were considered to be strong measures, but may not now match the post-Sept.11 measures initiated in the US and the EU. In India, there were old age practices for prevention of Money laundering in the sense of seizure and repossession of proceeds of crime. The statutes predominant before the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (Money Laundering Act of 2002) are:

Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance (XXXVIII of 1944).
The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976.
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance (XXXVIII of 1944): Under this law, police can get the proceeds of crime relating to bribe, breach of trust and cheating confiscated by an order of attachment and on completion of the criminal prosecution can get an order from court forfeiting the proceeds. This ordinance was modified in 1946 and responsibility of proof to the accused. In the event of crime under Prevention of Corruption Act, the implementation rests with the CBI. However this law covers proceeds of only certain crimes such corruption, breach of trust and cheating and not all the crimes under the Indian Penal Code.

The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976: According to this law, there is a penalty of illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. The application of this law is restricted to the persons convicted under the Customs Act, 1962 or Sea Customs Act, 1878 or other foreign exchange laws. Under this Act, no person shall hold any unlawfully acquired property either by himself or through any other person on his behalf. The word 'illegally acquired property' has been well defined under section 3(c) of the act.

There is very broad legislation in India on money laundering which includes all kinds of laundering of money relating to all crimes and offences under laws of India except offences relating to drug trafficking or offences under Indian Penal Code. As far as drug offences are concerned, prevention of money laundering is taken care of by Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985: Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 provide for the penalty of property derived from, or used in illegal traffic in narcotic drugs. Sections 68A to 68Y of Chapter VA of the Act provides for forfeiture of assets derived from or used in unlawful traffic. The provisions are so broad that the authorities administering the law have huge powers including the power to trace the source of drug related money or property and afterward to proceed with freezing of accounts and seizure of property and forfeiting it to the government.

Other analogous statutes: Besides these legislations, there is a law of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 under which the Central government regulates flow of funds to various organizations. If the Central government thinks any organization is acting against national interest, it can block its funds. Further to that Reserve Bank of India, which administers Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 has powers under section 11 of the Act to give appropriate directions to the authorized dealers to prevent violation of any laws. In addition to above Section 102 and Sections 451to 459 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 enables seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

The purpose of the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) is to combat money laundering in India in order to prevent and control money laundering, to confiscate and seize the property obtained from laundered money, and to deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India. It came into force from 1st July, 2015. The Act provides that whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to pamper or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property, shall be guilty of offences of money-laundering. For the purpose of money-laundering, the PMLA identifies certain offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Arms Act, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act, the proceeds of which would be covered under this Act.

International initiatives are also taken to fight against drug trafficking, terrorism and other organized and serious crimes have concluded that financial institutions including securities market intermediaries must establish procedures of internal control aimed at preventing and impeding money laundering and terrorist financing. In other nations such as US, The US Congress passed the USA Patriot Act of 2001 within 43 days of Sept.11, October 26, 2001. This Act made as many as 52 amendments to the existing Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The range of these new provisions touched every financial institution and business not only in the US, but also in many countries of the world. One of the changes made in the BSA requires every financial institution to establish anti-money laundering programmes. Moreover, the list of businesses defined as financial institutions is wide ranging and includes banks, brokers and dealers in securities or commodities, currency exchanges, insurance companies, credit card operators, dealers in precious metals, stones and jewels, travel agencies, businesses engaged in the sale of vehicles including automobiles, air planes and boats, casinos and gaming establishments, and even telegraph companies and US postal service. It also adds secretive banking systems, such as 'hawala', to the description of financial institutions. It creates customer documentation and due diligence duties. Simultaneously, it grants immunity to financial institutions and their personnel for sharing reports of doubtful activities with any government agency or with each other. It also makes it a crime to conceal more than US $ 10,000 in money or monetary instruments while entering or leaving the US. Consequently, huge number of financial institutions and businesses, who were not earlier concerned about money laundering, now have to maintain anti-money laundering programmes requiring them to ""develop internal policies, procedures and controls"", ""elect a compliance officer"", conduct ""ongoing employee training programmes"" and perform ""independent audit functions"".

Currently, the US intelligence agencies can have access to reports and records of financial institutions and businesses including suspicious activity reports filed by them. One of the major changes is ban of correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, which have no physical presence anywhere. A foreign bank must have a fixed address, employ at least one full-time employee, maintain operating records and be inspected by a banking authority to qualify for a correspondent account. Besides amending the BSA, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 also modified in the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986. It now acquires extra-territorial jurisdiction to combat terrorist funding and criminal proceeds. The law covered funds representing proceeds of nearly 200 specified unlawful activities such as fraud, kidnapping, gambling, espionage, drug trafficking, etc. It now covers bribing of a foreign public official, embezzlement of public funds, smuggling or export control violations involving items covered by the Arms Export Control Act as well as crimes of violence. The new law requires the financial institutions to provide information regarding customers within 120 days if the account is in the US and within seven days if the records are maintained outside the US in respect of correspondence accounts. The new law also supports forfeiture powers over funds of foreign persons and institutions. The US authorities now have vast power to track and grab laundered money that runs terrorist activities and to penalise the criminals involved. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 has also seen a jump in filing SARs. The US Finance Crimes Enforcement Network reported an increase in SARs by over 40 per cent in the year 2002 compared to the preceding year. The compliance costs for the financial institutions have also gone up but many think that this may be a small price to pay to be able to live in a world with reduced risks of terrorist assaults.

Procedures for Anti Money Laundering: Each registered intermediary must implement written procedures to implement the Anti-Money Laundering provisions as envisaged under the Prevention of Money laundering Act, 2002. Such procedures should include inter alia, the following three specific parameters which are related to the overall 'Client Due Diligence Process:

Policy for acceptance of clients
Procedure for identifying the clients
Transaction monitoring and reporting especially Suspicious

In India, to combat the threat of offences of money laundering, the Government is entrusting the work relating to investigation, attachment of property/proceeds of crime relating to the scheduled offences under the Act and filing of complaints etc. to the Directorate of Enforcement, which currently deals with offences under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

To summarize, money Laundering is spreading at speedy rate at global level and it is a serious matter for legislature authorities that must be curbed for smooth functioning of society and economic enhancement of all nations. All nations have to work together to combat such devastating criminal activity. Money Laundering is fundamentally, the process of transforming, through a series of stages, the proceeds of illegal or criminal activity, into apparently legitimately acquired funds. Today, due to technical modernization, the criminals are very clever and cheat the enforcing agencies through deploying a team of experts like chartered accountants, attorneys, banker's mafia, to cover their illicit money and pretence it as legal income. These professionals charge fee between 10 to 15% of the sum involved. The connection between white-collared criminals, politicians, enforcing agencies and gangs are so strong that it is difficult to break. Bankers also has vital role and without their involvement, the operation cannot be successful. There numerous payment option such wire transfer of funds has further aggravated the difficulties to identify the movement of sludge funds. The international type of money laundering requires international law enforcement cooperation to effectively examine and accuse those that initiate these complex criminal organizations. Money laundering must be combated mainly by penal ways and within the frameworks of international cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities. It can be said that simply enactment of Anti-Money Laundering Laws will not resolve such serious crime instead the Law enforcement Community must keep bound with the ever changing dynamics of money Launderers who continually evolves advanced techniques which helps them to implement strict law to curb money laundering."

Money laundering is usually used by criminals to hide money made through illegal act. It is the process by which huge amount of money obtained unlawfully, from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other severe crimes. Money laundering has an unfavourable impact on economy and political steadiness of nation. It is necessary that all nations of the world must jointly device policies and adopt measures to curb act of money laundering by resorting to forceful enforcement of law.\n\nGenerally people consider Money laundering is the conversion of black money into white money. This takes one back to cleaning the huge piles of cash. If it is done successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and ultimately to provide an authentic cover for their source of income. Money laundering fulfils the ambitions of the drug trafficker, the terrorist, the organized criminal, the insider dealer, the tax evader as well as the many other groups who need to avoid the kind of attention from the authorities that unexpected prosperity comes from illegal acts. These criminal tries to get money and power through criminal activities and then attempt to penetrate the legitimate society, thereby misrepresenting the terms of the compact. They create huge amount of money for the members of the enterprise and permit their associates to live extravagant lifestyles.\n\nConcept of Money Laundering: Money laundering is designated as the source of illegally obtained funds covered through a series of transfers and deals in order that those same funds can eventually be made to appear as legitimate income (Robinson). According to Interpol General Secretariat Assembly in 1995, money laundering is any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.\n\nMoney Laundering is an expression that has recent origin. Money laundering is a cultured crime that is not to be taken seriously by society. When comparing with street crimes, it is a modern crime. Some experts refer to it as a victimless crime but in reality, it is not a crime against a particular individual, but it is a crime against nations, economies government, rule of law and world at large. Money laundering has become a worldwide threat. The objective of a huge number of criminal acts is to get profit for the individual or group that performed the act and then hide either the source or the purpose of cash. Money laundering is the processing of these criminal proceeds to cover their illegal origin. This process is very crucial for government and other responsible authorities as it enables the criminal to enjoy money obtained from illegal source. Some of the crimes such as illegal arms sales, smuggling, corruption, drug trafficking and the activities of organized crime including tax evasion produce huge money. Insider trading, corruption and computer fraud schemes also generate more profits and create the incentive to legitimize the illegal gains through money laundering. When a criminal activity produces large profits, the individual or group involved must find a way to control the funds without attracting attention to the original activity or the persons involved. Criminals perform this by disguising the sources, changing the form, or transferring money to a place where they are less likely to attract attention. Otherwise, they will not be able to use the money because it would connect them to the criminal action, and law enforcement authorities would grab it. If criminals perform this process successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and eventually to provide a legitimate cover for their source of income. Where criminals are allowed to use the proceeds of crime, the ability to launder such proceeds makes crime more attractive.\n\nSignificance of Money Laundering: Money laundering is an important criminal issue for policy makers and government authorities that gained increasing significance after the occurrence of heart throbbing indents of 9/11 attack on the twin towers in the U.S. After that all nations has focused its attention on the notion of money laundering and has recognized it as a source of the funding of terrorist actions. The process of globalization and advancements of the communications have made crime increasingly international in scope, and the financial aspects of crime have become more complex due to technology enhancement. The huge expansion of international banks all over the world has facilitated the transmission and the disguising of the origin of funds. This may have shocking social consequences and poses a threat to the security of any nation at large or small scale. It offers immense facilities for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and all types of criminals to operate and increase their criminal activities. Laundering enables criminal activity to continue. Money laundering causes an alteration of resources to less productive areas of the economy which in turn deceases economic development. If security authorities and government ignore this crime, there will be serious consequences on social and political development of nation. The economic and political influence of criminal organizations can deteriorate the social fabric, collective ethical standards, and eventually the democratic institutions of civilisation.\n\nTheoretical review of money laundering: It has been demonstrated in academic reports that financial institutions have made efforts to detect and prevent money laundering since last many years, but the main feature of money laundering are its processes in which it is carried out. Many experts have argued that money laundering does not take a singular act but takes a more complex operation, which is completed in three basic steps which include placement, layering and integration (Anon, 2006). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2001: 7-8) defined money laundering as being the ""transferring (of) illegally obtained money or investments through an outside party to conceal the true source"". In South Africa, the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (2003), stated that money laundering is defined in local legislation as being ""virtually every act or transaction that involves the proceeds of crimes, including the spending of funds that were obtained illegally"". There are variation in views of different authorities to explain the notion of money laundering.\n\nProcesses of Money Laundering\n\nPlacement: First step is the Placement stage in the money laundering cycle. Money laundering activities is usually generated from cash intensive business, large amount of cash or hard currency and grown from illegal activities such as sale of drugs, illegal firearms, prostitution or human trafficking. Currencies gained from this cycle need to be disposed of immediately by the launderer, so they go as far as depositing it back in financial institutions, spending in retail economy, and involvement in a business or acquisition of an expensive property/asset or smuggled out of the country. The launderer\'s intention in this stage is to eliminate the cash from the place of possession so as to escape any form of detection from the authorities and to transform it to other form of assets such as travellers\' cheques. Temple (2002) delineated some of the more common ways in which placement could be achieved, such as exchanging currency for smaller denominations that will make it easier to utilise, transport or conceal to methods involving the use of multiple deposits entailing small amounts in different bank accounts. Nixon (2000) refers to the practice of utilising multiple deposits being placed in many accounts by different individuals as ""smurfing"". Moulette (1995) recognised other strategies such as use of representative offices of foreign banks, international ""houses"" or ""sub accounts"" that may be maintained by banks on behalf of their clients for the funnelling of funds through casino\'s or unregulated Asian games such as Pai-Gow.\n\nLayering: In this stage, the launderer tries to hide or disguise the origin of the funds by creating complicated layers of financial transactions designed to cover the audit trail and conceal it. Banerjee (2003) stated that layering serves to hide the source and ownership of the funds. Moulette (2000) suggested the methods used to accomplish layering such as the use of offset accounts by dealers, online electronic fund transfers between certain tax havens, and doubtful gold transactions in which large purchases of gold in countries with low VAT rates and then (there is an) exporting (of) the bullion back to the country of origin"". The aim of layering is to separate the illegal duties from the source of the crime, layers upon layers of transactions are created, moving illegal funds between accounts or business, or buying and selling assets on a local and international basis until the original source of the money is undetectable. Suter (2003) designated that there are other methods that can be adopted to allow, layering to take place that involve the over-invoicing and false invoicing of imports and exports.\n\nIntegration: After the layering stage, illegal funds are taken back into the financial system as payments for services rendered. Making the launderer feel fulfilled by making the funds appear to be legally earned. Illegal funds is returned to the economy and disguised as genuine income. Schroeder (2001) indicated that the techniques adopted to successfully integrate funds from a criminal enterprise would very often be similar to that of practices adopted by legitimate business.\n\nImpact of money laundering on nation: There are many dangerous impact of money laundering on country as well as whole world. According to McDowell and Novis (2001), there are following key effects of money laundering:\n\nUndermining of the legitimate private sector: Quirk (1997 : 7-9) stated that The use of front companies by money launderers undermines the legitimate private sector, as the motive of money launderers is not necessarily to make a profit out of operations of the front company.\nUndermining of the integrity of financial markets: The succeeding reputational loss by financial institutions results in a loss of confidence by consumers in these affected financial institutions who may be perceived to be involved in fraudulent activities. This could also affect the reputation of a country and force investors to invest in economies that are perceived to be less exposed to the risk of money laundering. Money laundering can deleteriously impact on the truthfulness of financial markets, and also weaken the reputation of a nation.\nLoss of control of economic policy: Reports of IMF (2003) signified that the size of the funds being laundered, and the fact that money launderers would want to launder their funds through developing economies to reduce possible detection of their schemes, can affect the inflow and outflow of funds in these countries.\nEconomic distortion and instability: Money laundering may also misrepresent capital flows, and thus destabilise the effective functioning of the world-wide economy. Castle and Lee (1999) argued that money launderers would not look at where to best invest their money based on economic principles, but rather at where it would be easier to avoid being caught or based on where the cost of avoidance was lower.\nLoss of revenue: Many theorists such as Kovacevic (2002) and Fundanga (2003) stated that money laundering decreases the tax funds available for collection in the economy and by implication government\'s revenues. Consequently, governments may have to levy higher taxes in order to obtain the funds necessary to fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens.\nSecurity threats to privatisation efforts: According to Chossudovsky (1999), it was observed that money launderers who are able to obtain previous government entities that are being privatised, can attempt to establish a legitimate front to launder funds. This can weaken economic reforms as money launders are not interested in operating these entities as going concerns, but rather as a channel for laundering money.\nReputation risk: Van Fossen (2003) asserted that nations that are competing as destinations for legitimate investments may face difficulty to do so if there is a perception that the country has a poor track record of dealing with money laundering or is seen to be a centre for money laundering. This is because legitimate investors are wary of being associated with any country that has a negative reputation.\n\nOther impacts of money laundering are as follows:\n\nIncreased criminality: The increase in criminality is serious effect and a matter of concern in money laundering. The triumph of money launderers is the distance they create between themselves and the criminal activity producing profit, so that they can live lavish life could through this crime without attracting attention and could also go to the extent of reinvesting their profits to finance other crimes. Therefore, government, legislative act and other enforcing laws must implement policies in legal procedure to curb the crime.\n\nSocial effect: Committing crime of money laundering transfers of economic power from the right people to the wrong. The good citizens and the government are dispossessed from their right, making the criminals take the benefit to flourish in their criminality. Money laundering damages the financial institution which is an important factor in the economic development of nation.\n\nIn developing countries where there is no strict control, the governments have to seek further contribution from good citizens, making people suffer more and continue to be subject to poverty. Companies cannot compete with operators financed by illegal funding, labours then become jobless and the high rate of unemployment result in an increase in criminality, dissatisfaction and insecurity. The burden on the government would then increase with the need to provide security therefore reallocating resources from more productive enterprise to other areas. This reduces productivity in the real sector of the economy by diverting resources from productive areas to social sectors; crime and corruption which are on the increase would then slow down economic growth and decrease human development.\n\nMicroeconomics effect: Money launderers generate and make use of companies that front for them. These companies are not interested in and but pretend to be involved in them. Usually the companies are not doing any serious business. The income generated from the company is not usually from the business but from their criminal activities. Their decisions are not usually based on economic considerations and would offer products at prices below cost price making the front companies have an unjustified competitive advantage. Legitimate businesses lose when competing, as there is no fair competition involved and results in business closures due to crowding out effect of private sector business by criminal organisations.\n\nMacroeconomic effect: There are numerous impacts of money laundering on the macroeconomic situations. These include volatility in exchange rates and interest rates due to unanticipated transfers of funds; fall in asset price due to the disposition of laundered funds; misallocation of resources in relative asset commodity prices arising from money laundering activities; loss of confidence in markets caused by insider trading, fraud and embezzlement. When businesses make less revenue and pay fewer taxes, people become unemployed and dependent on social assistance which is most times difficult to get in developing countries. When criminals use financial institution for laundering funds, this creates negative promotional and it\'s enough to scare banks into striving to keep criminals away from their terrain. Also banks have a risk of performing a balancing act between attracting new business and complying with the regulations and legislations. The securities markets (especially derivatives) have become the attention of money launderers and are posing an added risk to financial systems. Other indirect economic effects are higher insurance premiums for those who do not make fraudulent claims and higher costs to businesses therefore generating fewer profits which make it difficult to break even. According to Reilly (2008), money laundering has the ability to infiltrate the global financial system and also change economic data. Quirk (1997) in Reilly et al (2008) stated that money demand can appear to change from one country to another resulting in deceptive financial data. Income distribution also tends to be affected by money laundering because it could be redistributed from high savers to low ones, sound investments to risky ones. Due to such negative impact, policy makers have to face difficulty to devise effective responses to monetary threats and it causes difficulties in the government efforts to manage economic strategy. Sensible risks are prone to affect the reliability of banks and the management of economic policies. The prudential risk might be as a result of the corruption of the bank manager, when he/she begins to accept large sum of money from launders and this brings about non-market behaviour in the financial system. Steel (2006) affirmed that financial institutions are regarded as organizations that provide financial services to its customers or members, leaving them at the front position in the battle against money launderers. Financial institutions are not the only target the launderers use in their various schemes but they are accountable for financial dealings and for reporting any doubtful transactions.\n\nIt has been cleared that the Money laundering has negative consequences on monetary development. Money laundering constitutes a serious risk to national economies and respective governments. The penetration and sometimes saturation of illicit money into legitimate financial sectors and nations accounts can intimidate economic and political constancy. Economic crimes have a disturbing effect on a national economy since potential victims of such crimes are far more numerous than those in other forms of crime. Economic crimes also have the potential of unfavourably affecting people who do not prima-facie, seem to be the victims of the crime. For example, tax evasion results in forfeiture of government income and in turn affecting the potential of the government to spend on development schemes thereby affecting a large section of the population who could have benefited from such government expenditure. A company fraud not only results in cheating of the people who have invested in that company but may also adversely affects investors\' confidence and eventually the development of the economy. Legislature body has difficulty to quantify the negative economic effects of money laundering on economic development. Such activity damages the financial-sector institutions that are critical to economic growth, reduces productivity in the economy\'s real sector by diverting resources and encouraging crime and corruption, which slow economic growth, and can distort the economy\'s external sector international trade and capital flows to the detriment of long-term economic development.\n\nThe Financial Sector: Financial sector may get negative effects of money laundering particularly financial institutions including banking and non-banking financial institutions and equity markets, may directly or indirectly be affected. Basically, these institutions facilitate concentration of capital resources from domestic savings and funds from overseas. These institutions provide impetus to furtherance of investment prospects by providing conducive environment and efficient allocation of these resources to investment projects which contributes substantially to long run economic growth.\n\nReports signify that Money Laundering weakens the sustainability and development of financial institutions in two ways.\n\nFirstly, the financial institutions are debilitated directly through money laundering as there seems to be an association between money laundering and fraudulent activities undertaken by employees of the institutions. Likewise, with the rise in money laundering acts, major parts of financial institutions of a state are susceptible to crime by criminal elements. This strengthens the criminals of money laundering channels. This may lead to the removal of less equipped competitors and giving rise to domination.\n\nSecondly, customer trust is important to the development of comprehensive financial institutions, and the perceived risk to the growth of sound financial institutions, and the perceived risk to depositors and investors from institutional fraud and corruption. The Real Sector Money laundering harmfully affects economic development through the real sector by diverting resources to less productive activities and by facilitating domestic corruption and crime.\n\nMoney laundering also performed through the channels other than financial institutions that includes more sterile investments such as real estate, art, antiques, jewellery and luxury automobiles, or investments of the type that gives lower marginal productivity in an economy. These sub optimal allocations of resource give lower level of economic growth which is a serious disadvantage to economic progress for developing countries. Criminals invest their proceeds in companies and real estate in order to make further profits, legal or illegal. Most of these investments are in sectors that are familiar to the criminal, such as bar, restaurant, prostitution. The real estate sector is the largest and most susceptible sector for money laundering. Real estate is important for money laundering, because it is a non-transparent market where the values of the objects are often difficult for approximation and it is an efficient way to place large amounts of money. The price increase in real estate is lucrative and the annual profits on real business create a legal basis for income. The real estate has the following characteristics for criminal money:\n\nA safe investment\nThe objective value is difficult to assess.\nIt allows to realize ""white"" returns.\n\nThe External Sector: Money laundering activities may weaken the financial growth of any nation through the trade and international capital flows. Excessive illegal capital flight from a state may be facilitated by either domestic financial institutions or by foreign financial institutions. That illicit capital flight drains scarce resources specially from developing economies. In this way, economic growth of corresponding economy is adversely affected. Money laundering negatively affects trust of local citizens in their own domestic financial institutions as well as trust of foreign investors and financial institutions in a state\'s financial institution which ultimately contributes to economic growth. Money laundering channels may also be related with distortions of a country\'s\' imports and exports. As with the participation of criminal elements on the import side, they may use illegal proceeds to purchase imported luxury goods, either with laundered funds or as part of the process of laundering such funds. Such imports do not produce domestic economic activity or employment, and in some cases can theatrically reduce domestic prices, thus reducing the productivity of domestic enterprises. The reliability of the banking and financial services market place depends mainly on the perception that it functions within a framework of high legal, professional and ethical standards. A reputation for integrity is most valuable assets of a financial institution. Dangers for the reputation can happen when a country purposely declares to want to attract \'criminal money. If funds from criminal activity can be easily processed through a particular institution, either because its employees have been bribed or because the institution do not pay attention to the criminal nature of such funds, the institution could be drawn into active complicity with criminals and become part of the criminal system itself. Such network will damage the attitudes of other financial intermediaries and of regulatory authorities as well as ordinary customers.\n\nMoney laundering has other dangerous consequences also. It not only impends the financial system of nation by taking away command of the economic policy from the government, but also declines the moral and social position of the society by exposing it to activities such as drug trafficking, smuggling, corruption and other criminal activities. The Global Sector Money Laundering has become a world-wide problem. Criminals target foreign authority with liberal bank secrecy laws and feeble anti-money laundering regulatory governments as they transfer illegal funds through domestic and international financial institutions often with the speed and internet transactions. This huge penetration of criminal proceeds into world market can destabilize and can have a debasing effect on those who work within the market system. The infiltration of criminals into the genuine markets can also change the balance of economic power from responsible and responsive entities to scoundrel agents who have no political or social responsibility.\n\nPrevention and Combat Of Money Laundering\n\nLegislators around the world have realized that concentrated efforts are required to deal with illegal funding and control money laundering.\n\nIndia has different laws to tackle smuggling, narcotics, foreign trade violations, foreign exchange manipulations and also special legal provisions for preventive detention and forfeiture of property, which were enacted over a period of time to deal with such severe crimes. Some of these were considered to be strong measures, but may not now match the post-Sept.11 measures initiated in the US and the EU. In India, there were old age practices for prevention of Money laundering in the sense of seizure and repossession of proceeds of crime. The statutes predominant before the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (Money Laundering Act of 2002) are:\n\nCriminal Law Amendment Ordinance (XXXVIII of 1944).\nThe Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976.\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.\n\nCriminal Law Amendment Ordinance (XXXVIII of 1944): Under this law, police can get the proceeds of crime relating to bribe, breach of trust and cheating confiscated by an order of attachment and on completion of the criminal prosecution can get an order from court forfeiting the proceeds. This ordinance was modified in 1946 and responsibility of proof to the accused. In the event of crime under Prevention of Corruption Act, the implementation rests with the CBI. However this law covers proceeds of only certain crimes such corruption, breach of trust and cheating and not all the crimes under the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976: According to this law, there is a penalty of illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. The application of this law is restricted to the persons convicted under the Customs Act, 1962 or Sea Customs Act, 1878 or other foreign exchange laws. Under this Act, no person shall hold any unlawfully acquired property either by himself or through any other person on his behalf. The word \'illegally acquired property\' has been well defined under section 3(c) of the act.\n\nThere is very broad legislation in India on money laundering which includes all kinds of laundering of money relating to all crimes and offences under laws of India except offences relating to drug trafficking or offences under Indian Penal Code. As far as drug offences are concerned, prevention of money laundering is taken care of by Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.\n\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985: Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 provide for the penalty of property derived from, or used in illegal traffic in narcotic drugs. Sections 68A to 68Y of Chapter VA of the Act provides for forfeiture of assets derived from or used in unlawful traffic. The provisions are so broad that the authorities administering the law have huge powers including the power to trace the source of drug related money or property and afterward to proceed with freezing of accounts and seizure of property and forfeiting it to the government.\n\nOther analogous statutes: Besides these legislations, there is a law of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 under which the Central government regulates flow of funds to various organizations. If the Central government thinks any organization is acting against national interest, it can block its funds. Further to that Reserve Bank of India, which administers Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 has powers under section 11 of the Act to give appropriate directions to the authorized dealers to prevent violation of any laws. In addition to above Section 102 and Sections 451to 459 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 enables seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.\n\nThe purpose of the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) is to combat money laundering in India in order to prevent and control money laundering, to confiscate and seize the property obtained from laundered money, and to deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India. It came into force from 1st July, 2015. The Act provides that whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to pamper or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property, shall be guilty of offences of money-laundering. For the purpose of money-laundering, the PMLA identifies certain offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Arms Act, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act, the proceeds of which would be covered under this Act.\n\nInternational initiatives are also taken to fight against drug trafficking, terrorism and other organized and serious crimes have concluded that financial institutions including securities market intermediaries must establish procedures of internal control aimed at preventing and impeding money laundering and terrorist financing. In other nations such as US, The US Congress passed the USA Patriot Act of 2001 within 43 days of Sept.11, October 26, 2001. This Act made as many as 52 amendments to the existing Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The range of these new provisions touched every financial institution and business not only in the US, but also in many countries of the world. One of the changes made in the BSA requires every financial institution to establish anti-money laundering programmes. Moreover, the list of businesses defined as financial institutions is wide ranging and includes banks, brokers and dealers in securities or commodities, currency exchanges, insurance companies, credit card operators, dealers in precious metals, stones and jewels, travel agencies, businesses engaged in the sale of vehicles including automobiles, air planes and boats, casinos and gaming establishments, and even telegraph companies and US postal service. It also adds secretive banking systems, such as \'hawala\', to the description of financial institutions. It creates customer documentation and due diligence duties. Simultaneously, it grants immunity to financial institutions and their personnel for sharing reports of doubtful activities with any government agency or with each other. It also makes it a crime to conceal more than US $ 10,000 in money or monetary instruments while entering or leaving the US. Consequently, huge number of financial institutions and businesses, who were not earlier concerned about money laundering, now have to maintain anti-money laundering programmes requiring them to ""develop internal policies, procedures and controls"", ""elect a compliance officer"", conduct ""ongoing employee training programmes"" and perform ""independent audit functions"".\n\nCurrently, the US intelligence agencies can have access to reports and records of financial institutions and businesses including suspicious activity reports filed by them. One of the major changes is ban of correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, which have no physical presence anywhere. A foreign bank must have a fixed address, employ at least one full-time employee, maintain operating records and be inspected by a banking authority to qualify for a correspondent account. Besides amending the BSA, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 also modified in the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986. It now acquires extra-territorial jurisdiction to combat terrorist funding and criminal proceeds. The law covered funds representing proceeds of nearly 200 specified unlawful activities such as fraud, kidnapping, gambling, espionage, drug trafficking, etc. It now covers bribing of a foreign public official, embezzlement of public funds, smuggling or export control violations involving items covered by the Arms Export Control Act as well as crimes of violence. The new law requires the financial institutions to provide information regarding customers within 120 days if the account is in the US and within seven days if the records are maintained outside the US in respect of correspondence accounts. The new law also supports forfeiture powers over funds of foreign persons and institutions. The US authorities now have vast power to track and grab laundered money that runs terrorist activities and to penalise the criminals involved. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 has also seen a jump in filing SARs. The US Finance Crimes Enforcement Network reported an increase in SARs by over 40 per cent in the year 2002 compared to the preceding year. The compliance costs for the financial institutions have also gone up but many think that this may be a small price to pay to be able to live in a world with reduced risks of terrorist assaults.\n\nProcedures for Anti Money Laundering: Each registered intermediary must implement written procedures to implement the Anti-Money Laundering provisions as envisaged under the Prevention of Money laundering Act, 2002. Such procedures should include inter alia, the following three specific parameters which are related to the overall \'Client Due Diligence Process:\n\nPolicy for acceptance of clients\nProcedure for identifying the clients\nTransaction monitoring and reporting especially Suspicious\n\nIn India, to combat the threat of offences of money laundering, the Government is entrusting the work relating to investigation, attachment of property/proceeds of crime relating to the scheduled offences under the Act and filing of complaints etc. to the Directorate of Enforcement, which currently deals with offences under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.\n\nTo summarize, money Laundering is spreading at speedy rate at global level and it is a serious matter for legislature authorities that must be curbed for smooth functioning of society and economic enhancement of all nations. All nations have to work together to combat such devastating criminal activity. Money Laundering is fundamentally, the process of transforming, through a series of stages, the proceeds of illegal or criminal activity, into apparently legitimately acquired funds. Today, due to technical modernization, the criminals are very clever and cheat the enforcing agencies through deploying a team of experts like chartered accountants, attorneys, banker\'s mafia, to cover their illicit money and pretence it as legal income. These professionals charge fee between 10 to 15% of the sum involved. The connection between white-collared criminals, politicians, enforcing agencies and gangs are so strong that it is difficult to break. Bankers also has vital role and without their involvement, the operation cannot be successful. There numerous payment option such wire transfer of funds has further aggravated the difficulties to identify the movement of sludge funds. The international type of money laundering requires international law enforcement cooperation to effectively examine and accuse those that initiate these complex criminal organizations. Money laundering must be combated mainly by penal ways and within the frameworks of international cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities. It can be said that simply enactment of Anti-Money Laundering Laws will not resolve such serious crime instead the Law enforcement Community must keep bound with the ever changing dynamics of money Launderers who continually evolves advanced techniques which helps them to implement strict law to curb money laundering.', 'breadcrumbs': [{'link': 'https://www.civilserviceindia.com/index.html', 'name': 'Home'}, {'link': 'https://www.civilserviceindia.com/subject/index.html', 'name': 'Subject'}, {'link': 'https://www.civilserviceindia.com/subject/General-Studies/index.html', 'name': 'General Studies'}, {'link': 'https://www.civilserviceindia.com/subject/General-Studies/notes/index.html', 'name': 'Notes'}, {'name': 'Money Laundering and Its Prevention'}], 'description': 'Read about Money Laundering and Its Prevention.

Money laundering is usually used by criminals to hide money made through illegal act. It is the process by which huge amount of money obtained unlawfully, from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other severe crimes. Money laundering has an unfavourable impact on economy and political steadiness of nation. It is necessary that all nations of the world must jointly device policies and adopt measures to curb act of money laundering by resorting to forceful enforcement of law. </p>\n<div class=""pd""><a href=""https://www.civilserviceindia.com/signup/signup.php"">Buy These <span style=""font-size:21px;"">Notes</span> in <span style=""font-size:21px;"">PDF</span> Format</a></div>\n<p>Generally people consider Money laundering is the conversion of black money into white money. This takes one back to cleaning the huge piles of cash. If it is done successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and ultimately to provide an authentic cover for their source of income. Money laundering fulfils the ambitions of the drug trafficker, the terrorist, the organized criminal, the insider dealer, the tax evader as well as the many other groups who need to avoid the kind of attention from the authorities that unexpected prosperity comes from illegal acts. These criminal tries to get money and power through criminal activities and then attempt to penetrate the legitimate society, thereby misrepresenting the terms of the compact. They create huge amount of money for the members of the enterprise and permit their associates to live extravagant lifestyles. </p>\n\n<p><b>Concept of Money Laundering:</b> Money laundering is designated as the source of illegally obtained funds covered through a series of transfers and deals in order that those same funds can eventually be made to appear as legitimate income (Robinson).  According to Interpol General Secretariat Assembly in 1995, money laundering is any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.</p>\n\n<p>Money Laundering is an expression that has recent origin. Money laundering is a cultured crime that is not to be taken seriously by society. When comparing with street crimes, it is a modern crime. Some experts refer to it as a victimless crime but in reality, it is not a crime against a particular individual, but it is a crime against nations, economies government, rule of law and world at large. Money laundering has become a worldwide threat. The objective of a huge number of criminal acts is to get profit for the individual or group that performed the act and then hide either the source or the purpose of cash. Money laundering is the processing of these criminal proceeds to cover their illegal origin. This process is very crucial for government and other responsible authorities as it enables the criminal to enjoy money obtained from illegal source. Some of the crimes such as illegal arms sales, smuggling, corruption, drug trafficking and the activities of organized crime including tax evasion produce huge money. Insider trading, corruption and computer fraud schemes also generate more profits and create the incentive to legitimize the illegal gains through money laundering. When a criminal activity produces large profits, the individual or group involved must find a way to control the funds without attracting attention to the original activity or the persons involved. Criminals perform this by disguising the sources, changing the form, or transferring money to a place where they are less likely to attract attention. Otherwise, they will not be able to use the money because it would connect them to the criminal action, and law enforcement authorities would grab it. If criminals perform this process successfully, it allows the criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and eventually to provide a legitimate cover for their source of income. Where criminals are allowed to use the proceeds of crime, the ability to launder such proceeds makes crime more attractive. </p>\n\n\n<p><b>Significance of Money Laundering:</b> Money laundering is an important criminal issue for policy makers and government authorities that gained increasing significance after the occurrence of heart throbbing indents of 9/11 attack on the twin towers in the U.S. After that all nations has focused its attention on the notion of money laundering and has recognized it as a source of the funding of terrorist actions. The process of globalization and advancements of the communications have made crime increasingly international in scope, and the financial aspects of crime have become more complex due to technology enhancement. The huge expansion of international banks all over the world has facilitated the transmission and the disguising of the origin of funds. This may have shocking social consequences and poses a threat to the security of any nation at large or small scale. It offers immense facilities for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and all types of criminals to operate and increase their criminal activities. Laundering enables criminal activity to continue. Money laundering causes an alteration of resources to less productive areas of the economy which in turn deceases economic development. If security authorities and government ignore this crime, there will be serious consequences on social and political development of nation. The economic and political influence of criminal organizations can deteriorate the social fabric, collective ethical standards, and eventually the democratic institutions of civilisation.</p>\n\n<p><b>Theoretical review of money laundering:</b> It has been demonstrated in academic reports that financial institutions have made efforts to detect and prevent money laundering since last many years, but the main feature of money laundering are its processes in which it is carried out. Many experts have argued that money laundering does not take a singular act but takes a more complex operation, which is completed in three basic steps which include placement, layering and integration (Anon, 2006). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2001: 7-8) defined money laundering as being the ""transferring (of) illegally obtained money or investments through an outside party to conceal the true source"". In South Africa, the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (2003), stated that money laundering is defined in local legislation as being ""virtually every act or transaction that involves the proceeds of crimes, including the spending of funds that were obtained illegally"". There are variation in views of different authorities to explain the notion of money laundering.</p>\n\n\n<h2 title=""Processes of Money Laundering"">Processes of Money Laundering</h2>\n\n<p><b>Placement:</b> First step is the Placement stage in the money laundering cycle. Money laundering activities is usually generated from cash intensive business, large amount of cash or hard currency and grown from illegal activities such as sale of drugs, illegal firearms, prostitution or human trafficking. Currencies gained from this cycle need to be disposed of immediately by the launderer, so they go as far as depositing it back in financial institutions, spending in retail economy, and involvement in a business or acquisition of an expensive property/asset or smuggled out of the country. The launderer\'s intention in this stage is to eliminate the cash from the place of possession so as to escape any form of detection from the authorities and to transform it to other form of assets such as travellers\' cheques. Temple (2002) delineated some of the more common ways in which placement could be achieved, such as exchanging currency for smaller denominations that will make it easier to utilise, transport or conceal to methods involving the use of multiple deposits entailing small amounts in different bank accounts. Nixon (2000) refers to the practice of utilising multiple deposits being placed in many accounts by different individuals as ""smurfing"". Moulette (1995) recognised other strategies such as use of representative offices of foreign banks, international ""houses"" or ""sub accounts"" that may be maintained by banks on behalf of their clients for the  funnelling of funds through casino\'s or unregulated Asian games such as Pai-Gow.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Layering:</b> In this stage, the launderer tries to hide or disguise the origin of the funds by creating complicated layers of financial transactions designed to cover the audit trail and conceal it. Banerjee (2003) stated that layering serves to hide the source and ownership of the funds. Moulette (2000) suggested the methods used to accomplish layering such as the use of offset accounts by dealers, online electronic fund transfers between certain tax havens, and doubtful gold transactions in which large purchases of gold in countries with low VAT rates and then (there is an) exporting (of) the bullion back to the country of origin"". The aim of layering is to separate the illegal duties from the source of the crime, layers upon layers of transactions are created, moving illegal funds between accounts or business, or buying and selling assets on a local and international basis until the original source of the money is undetectable.  Suter (2003) designated that there are other methods that can be adopted to allow, layering to take place that involve the over-invoicing and false invoicing of imports and exports.</p>\n\n<p><b>Integration:</b> After the layering stage, illegal funds are taken back into the financial system as payments for services rendered. Making the launderer feel fulfilled by making the funds appear to be legally earned. Illegal funds is returned to the economy and disguised as genuine income. Schroeder (2001) indicated that the techniques adopted to successfully integrate funds from a criminal enterprise would very often be similar to that of practices adopted by legitimate business.</p>\n\n<b>Basic steps of money laundering: (Source: Georgios Boustras, 2012 )</b>\n\n<img src=""images/steps-of-money-laundering.png"" alt=""Money Laundering"" title=""Basic steps of Money Laundering"" class=""img-responsive"">\n\n<p><b>Impact of money laundering on nation:</b> There are many dangerous impact of money laundering on country as well as whole world. According to McDowell and Novis (2001), there are following key effects of money laundering:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Undermining of the legitimate private sector: Quirk (1997 : 7-9) stated that The use of front companies by money launderers undermines the legitimate private sector, as the motive of money launderers is not necessarily to make a profit out of operations of the front company.</li>\n    <li>Undermining of the integrity of financial markets: The succeeding reputational loss by financial institutions results in a loss of confidence by consumers in these affected financial institutions who may be perceived to be involved in fraudulent activities. This could also affect the reputation of a country and force investors to invest in economies that are perceived to be less exposed to the risk of money laundering. Money laundering can deleteriously impact on the truthfulness of financial markets, and also weaken the reputation of a nation.</li>\n    <li>Loss of control of economic policy: Reports of IMF (2003) signified that the size of the funds being laundered, and the fact that money launderers would want to launder their funds through developing economies to reduce possible detection of their schemes, can affect the inflow and outflow of funds in these countries.</li>\n    <li>Economic distortion and instability: Money laundering may also misrepresent capital flows, and thus destabilise the effective functioning of the world-wide economy. Castle and Lee (1999) argued that money launderers would not look at where to best invest their money based on economic principles, but rather at where it would be easier to avoid being caught or based on where the cost of avoidance was lower.</li>\n    <li>Loss of revenue: Many theorists such as Kovacevic (2002) and Fundanga (2003) stated that money laundering decreases the tax funds available for collection in the economy and by implication government\'s revenues. Consequently, governments may have to levy higher taxes in order to obtain the funds necessary to fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens.</li>\n    <li>Security threats to privatisation efforts: According to Chossudovsky (1999), it was observed that money launderers who are able to obtain previous government entities that are being privatised, can attempt to establish a legitimate front to launder funds. This can weaken economic reforms as money launders are not interested in operating these entities as going concerns, but rather as a channel for laundering money.</li>\n    <li>Reputation risk: Van Fossen (2003) asserted that nations that are competing as destinations for legitimate investments may face difficulty to do so if there is a perception that the country has a poor track record of dealing with money laundering or is seen to be a centre for money laundering. This is because legitimate investors are wary of being associated with any country that has a negative reputation.</li>    \n</ol>\n\n<p>Other impacts of money laundering are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><b>Increased criminality:</b> The increase in criminality is serious effect and a matter of concern in money laundering. The triumph of money launderers is the distance they create between themselves and the criminal activity producing profit, so that they can live lavish life could through this crime without attracting attention and could also go to the extent of reinvesting their profits to finance other crimes. Therefore, government, legislative act and other enforcing laws must implement policies in legal procedure to curb the crime. </p>\n\n<p><b>Social effect:</b> Committing crime of money laundering transfers of economic power from the right people to the wrong. The good citizens and the government are dispossessed from their right, making the criminals take the benefit to flourish in their criminality. Money laundering damages the financial institution which is an important factor in the economic development of nation. </p>\n\n<p>In developing countries where there is no strict control, the governments have to seek further contribution from good citizens, making people suffer more and continue to be subject to poverty. Companies cannot compete with operators financed by illegal funding, labours then become jobless and the high rate of unemployment result in an increase in criminality, dissatisfaction and insecurity. The burden on the government would then increase with the need to provide security therefore reallocating resources from more productive enterprise to other areas. This reduces productivity in the real sector of the economy by diverting resources from productive areas to social sectors; crime and corruption which are on the increase would then slow down economic growth and decrease human development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Microeconomics effect:</b> Money launderers generate and make use of companies that front for them. These companies are not interested in and but pretend to be involved in them. Usually the companies are not doing any serious business. The income generated from the company is not usually from the business but from their criminal activities. Their decisions are not usually based on economic considerations and would offer products at prices below cost price making the front companies have an unjustified competitive advantage. Legitimate businesses lose when competing, as there is no fair competition involved and results in business closures due to crowding out effect of private sector business by criminal organisations.</p>\n\n<p><b>Macroeconomic effect:</b> There are numerous impacts of money laundering on the macroeconomic situations. These include volatility in exchange rates and interest rates due to unanticipated transfers of funds; fall in asset price due to the disposition of laundered funds; misallocation of resources in relative asset commodity prices arising from money laundering activities; loss of confidence in markets caused by insider trading, fraud and embezzlement. When businesses make less revenue and pay fewer taxes, people become unemployed and dependent on social assistance which is most times difficult to get in developing countries. When criminals use financial institution for laundering funds, this creates negative promotional and it\'s enough to scare banks into striving to keep criminals away from their terrain. Also banks have a risk of performing a balancing act between attracting new business and complying with the regulations and legislations. The securities markets (especially derivatives) have become the attention of money launderers and are posing an added risk to financial systems. Other indirect economic effects are higher insurance premiums for those who do not make fraudulent claims and higher costs to businesses therefore generating fewer profits which make it difficult to break even. According to Reilly (2008), money laundering has the ability to infiltrate the global financial system and also change economic data. Quirk (1997) in Reilly et al (2008) stated that money demand can appear to change from one country to another resulting in deceptive financial data.  Income distribution also tends to be affected by money laundering because it could be redistributed from high savers to low ones, sound investments to risky ones. Due to such negative impact, policy makers have to face difficulty to devise effective responses to monetary threats and it causes difficulties in the government efforts to manage economic strategy. Sensible risks are prone to affect the reliability of banks and the management of economic policies. The prudential risk might be as a result of the corruption of the bank manager, when he/she begins to accept large sum of money from launders and this brings about non-market behaviour in the financial system. Steel (2006) affirmed that financial institutions are regarded as organizations that provide financial services to its customers or members, leaving them at the front position in the battle against money launderers. Financial institutions are not the only target the launderers use in their various schemes but they are accountable for financial dealings and for reporting any doubtful transactions.</p>\n\n<p>It has been cleared that the Money laundering has negative consequences on monetary development. Money laundering constitutes a serious risk to national economies and respective governments. The penetration and sometimes saturation of illicit money into legitimate financial sectors and nations accounts can intimidate economic and political constancy.  Economic crimes have a disturbing effect on a national economy since potential victims of such crimes are far more numerous than those in other forms of crime. Economic crimes also have the potential of unfavourably affecting people who do not prima-facie, seem to be the victims of the crime. For example, tax evasion results in forfeiture of government income and in turn affecting the potential of the government to spend on development schemes thereby affecting a large section of the population who could have benefited from such government expenditure. A company fraud not only results in cheating of the people who have invested in that company but may also adversely affects investors\' confidence and eventually the development of the economy. Legislature body has difficulty to quantify the negative economic effects of money laundering on economic development. Such activity damages the financial-sector institutions that are critical to economic growth, reduces productivity in the economy\'s real sector by diverting resources and encouraging crime and corruption, which slow economic growth, and can distort the economy\'s external sector international trade and capital flows to the detriment of long-term economic development.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Financial Sector:</b> Financial sector may get negative effects of money laundering particularly financial institutions including banking and non-banking financial institutions and equity markets, may directly or indirectly be affected. Basically, these institutions facilitate concentration of capital resources from domestic savings and funds from overseas. These institutions provide impetus to furtherance of investment prospects by providing conducive environment and efficient allocation of these resources to investment projects which contributes substantially to long run economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Reports signify that Money Laundering weakens the sustainability and development of financial institutions in two ways.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, the financial institutions are debilitated directly through money laundering as there seems to be an association between money laundering and fraudulent activities undertaken by employees of the institutions. Likewise, with the rise in money laundering acts, major parts of financial institutions of a state are susceptible to crime by criminal elements. This strengthens the criminals of money laundering channels. This may lead to the removal of less equipped competitors and giving rise to domination. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, customer trust is important to the development of comprehensive financial institutions, and the perceived risk to the growth of sound financial institutions, and the perceived risk to depositors and investors from institutional fraud and corruption. The Real Sector Money laundering harmfully affects economic development through the real sector by diverting resources to less productive activities and by facilitating domestic corruption and crime.</p>\n\n<p>Money laundering also performed through the channels other than financial institutions that includes more sterile investments such as real estate, art, antiques, jewellery and luxury automobiles, or investments of the type that gives lower marginal productivity in an economy. These sub optimal allocations of resource give lower level of economic growth which is a serious disadvantage to economic progress for developing countries. Criminals invest their proceeds in companies and real estate in order to make further profits, legal or illegal. Most of these investments are in sectors that are familiar to the criminal, such as bar, restaurant, prostitution. The real estate sector is the largest and most susceptible sector for money laundering. Real estate is important for money laundering, because it is a non-transparent market where the values of the objects are often difficult for approximation and it is an efficient way to place large amounts of money. The price increase in real estate is lucrative and the annual profits on real business create a legal basis for income. The real estate has the following characteristics for criminal money:</p>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A safe investment </li>\n    <li>The objective value is difficult to assess.</li>\n    <li>It allows to realize ""white"" returns. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><b>The External Sector:</b> Money laundering activities may weaken the financial growth of any nation through the trade and international capital flows. Excessive illegal capital flight from a state may be facilitated by either domestic financial institutions or by foreign financial institutions. That illicit capital flight drains scarce resources specially from developing economies. In this way, economic growth of corresponding economy is adversely affected. Money laundering negatively affects trust of local citizens in their own domestic financial institutions as well as trust of foreign investors and financial institutions in a state\'s financial institution which ultimately contributes to economic growth. Money laundering channels may also be related with distortions of a country\'s\' imports and exports. As with the participation of criminal elements on the import side, they may use illegal proceeds to purchase imported luxury goods, either with laundered funds or as part of the process of laundering such funds. Such imports do not produce domestic economic activity or employment, and in some cases can theatrically reduce domestic prices, thus reducing the productivity of domestic enterprises. The reliability of the banking and financial services market place depends mainly on the perception that it functions within a framework of high legal, professional and ethical standards. A reputation for integrity is most valuable assets of a financial institution. Dangers for the reputation can happen when a country purposely declares to want to attract \'criminal money. If funds from criminal activity can be easily processed through a particular institution, either because its employees have been bribed or because the institution do not pay attention to the criminal nature of such funds, the institution could be drawn into active complicity with criminals and become part of the criminal system itself. Such network will damage the attitudes of other financial intermediaries and of regulatory authorities as well as ordinary customers. </p>\n\n<p>Money laundering has other dangerous consequences also. It not only impends the financial system of nation by taking away command of the economic policy from the government, but also declines the moral and social position of the society by exposing it to activities such as drug trafficking, smuggling, corruption and other criminal activities. The Global Sector Money Laundering has become a world-wide problem.

58	Canberk	European Central Bank	Company	https://fintech-bulletin.com/an-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy/	"Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board, provides insight into the ECB’s work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

A recent survey among 66 central banks by the Bank for International Settlements shows that more than 80% are working on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The European Central Bank is one of them.

Not because we want to keep up with fashionable trends, but because we have to be ready. Ready to embrace financial technological innovation which has the potential to transform payments and money faster, and in more disruptive ways, than ever before.

We are technology neutral. But if our customers, the people of Europe signalled a change in payments behaviour, we would want to preserve their direct link to the ultimate owner of our currency by maintaining their access to central bank liabilities in euro.

Although cash often gets a bad press, demand is not receding. We currently see no indication that the public at large is willing to abandon the valued and trusted advantages of cash. But we are preparing to be ready should things change.

Part of ECB mandate to be ready for change

One implication of financial technological innovation could be an increasingly cashless economy in which people may no longer be able to hold risk-free central bank money. Reliable access to money would then hinge on the stability and efficiency of private retail infrastructures. And trust in money itself would rely on trust in the intermediaries that issue private money.

This is one reason why central banks keep fully up to speed on financial technological developments. After all, providing safe money and a reliable means of payment have been an integral part of the mandate and core business of central banks since their very inception. The ECB is no exception.

So we should be looking ahead and consider whether, in the future, central banks will need to provide the public with some form of digital currency. While electronic payments are already crowding out the use of cash in some countries, whose currencies seem less attractive than the euro, there is no such trend away from cash in the euro area.

Some 76% of all transactions in the euro area are carried out in cash, amounting to more than half of the total value of all payments. The demand for cash in the euro area currently outstrips the rate of nominal GDP growth.

In crisis times, the demand for cash surges even higher. At mid-March this year, the weekly increase in the value of banknotes in circulation almost reached the historical peak of €19 billion.

The ECB’s debate on CBDCs is therefore mainly analytical. Whether and when it becomes more of a policy debate will largely depend on the preferences of households.

We are always willing to innovate in the form of money and payment services that we provide. If, for instance, people voiced a preference tomorrow for plastic or polymer banknotes rather than the traditional paper ones, we would happily accommodate them.

In the same vein, we closely follow technological developments and reflect on the type of money and payments that are best suited to the needs of an increasingly digital economy.

The lack of a concrete “business case” for a CBDC at present should and does not stop us from seriously exploring the optimal design of a CBDC so that we will be well prepared should we ever take a policy decision to issue a digital currency. To this end, we have set up a task force on a CBDC within the Eurosystem.

Let me give you a preview of our deliberations, starting with different design options.

Legally solid despite fancy design?

Most of the money issued by central banks is in fact already digital, albeit not called CBDC. This is true for the bulk of the money issued through our wholesale credit operations with our counterparties. At present, access to the central bank balance sheet offers the possibility to access digital central bank money.

What could change in the future is the scope of the parties eligible to access our central bank balance sheets. Indeed, this lies at the heart of the discussion on CBDCs.

A wholesale CBDC, restricted to a limited group of financial counterparties, would be largely business as usual. However, a retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer. So a retail CBDC is now our main focus.

Setting up a CBDC would require a solid legal basis, in line with the principle of conferral under EU law.

One key consideration here is whether a retail CBDC could and should have the same legal tender status as banknotes and coins. In practice, legal tender status implies that a CBDC would have to be usable at any location and under any condition, possibly even offline.

Without legal tender status, the legal basis would need to be clarified, as would the relationship between a CBDC and euro banknotes and coins, along with the process by which one could be exchanged for the other. Should it not be acknowledged that the ECB’s exclusive right to authorise issuance in euro would also be applicable to a digital issuance?

A retail CBDC could be based on digital tokens, which would circulate in a decentralised manner – that is without a central ledger – and allow for anonymity towards the central bank, similar to cash. Some argue that a token-based digital currency might not guarantee complete anonymity. If that proved to be the case, it would inevitably raise social, political and legal issues.

We are currently looking into the legal questions raised by the potential use of intermediaries to facilitate the circulation of a CBDC and also the processing of transactions in a CBDC. To what extent are we permitted to outsource public law tasks to private entities? And what would be the appropriate extent of supervision over such entities?

Alternatively, a retail CBDC could be based on deposit accounts with the central bank. Though involving vast numbers of accounts, it would not be a particularly innovative option from a technological viewpoint. For the euro area, it would basically mean increasing the number of current deposit accounts offered from around ten thousand to between 300 and 500 million.

A CBDC of this nature would enable the central bank to register transfers between users, thereby providing protection against money laundering and other illicit uses (or those considered illicit by the rulers of the day), depending on the degree of privacy granted to users.

These are just two of the many ways to design a CBDC. We are currently scrutinising the various options to assess their potential impact – both positive and negative – on the financial system and on our ability to honour our mandate.

Disintermediation – economically inefficient and legally untenable

You may wonder why central banks have not chosen to provide retail access to central bank money, despite the technology for an account-based CBDC already being largely available. The main reason is that introducing a retail CBDC could have major consequences for the financial system.

If households were able to convert commercial bank deposits into a CBDC at a rate of 1 to 1, they may find it far more attractive to hold a risk-free CBDC rather than bank deposits. During a systemic banking crisis, this could trigger digital bank runs of unprecedented speed and scale, magnifying the effects of such a crisis.

Banks might manage to render their deposits more attractive than central bank ones. They could, for instance, provide additional services to those offered by central banks. Such services could include paying bills, or cross-selling financial insurance products.

Otherwise – even in the absence of a crisis – a readily convertible CBDC could crowd out bank deposits, leading to the disintermediation of the banking sector. This could have far-reaching implications for the structure of the financial system and for the ability of central banks to perform their core tasks and ensure that their monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.

If the central bank were to take retail deposits, it might also have to provide loans, with all the ensuing consequences. The central bank would need to launch customer-facing business lines. Deposit and lending facilities would also require the central bank to take on the burden of regulatory compliance in areas such as anti-money laundering, consumer protection and confidentiality.

Some argue that this may reinforce monetary sovereignty, as disintermediation would make the financial system safer and reduce the moral hazard of banks by diminishing their role in money creation.

But disintermediation would be economically inefficient and legally untenable. The EU Treaty provides for the ECB to operate in an open market economy, essentially reflecting a policy choice in favour of decentralised market decisions on the optimal allocation of resources.

Historical cases of economy-wide resource allocation by central banks are hardly models of efficiency or good service. Furthermore, a retail CBDC would create a disproportionate concentration of power in the central bank.

These potentially highly adverse effects on the financial system would appear to outweigh the benefits envisaged by the introduction of a retail CBDC.

What, then, could be done to mitigate the impact of a CBDC on the financial system?

One option could be to remunerate CBDC at below-market rates in order to create incentives for non-banks to rely more on market-based alternatives rather than on central bank deposits.

The drawback would be that, in times of crisis, it may become necessary to apply highly negative rates, which could generate criticism from the public and substantially undermine public confidence in the central bank as well as in the basic values of saving which underlie our societies.

Another option is a tiered remuneration system. In line with the functions of money, the first tier couldserve as a means of payment. The central bank would have to refrain from setting a lower or a negative interest rate in order to keep a CBDC attractive to the public as a means of payment. While the second tier could serve as a store of value, the central banks could discourage people from using it as such by setting unattractive interest rates.

However, such schemes should draw from the experience of multiple exchange rate regimes. And the repercussions of the intentional use of such schemes need to be subjected to an additional comprehensive investigation.

So we have plenty of questions on CBDC to discuss. In monitoring the evolution and uses of technology, the ECB respects technological neutrality. We do not serve technology – technology serves us. We will only introduce a digital currency if we become firmly convinced that it is both necessary and proportionate to fulfil our tasks in ensuring the stability of our currency.

In the meantime, we take a keen interest in digital innovation and in the changing expectations of money users, and we are refining our thinking on CBDC – both within the ECB, the Eurosystem and in the international central banking community. CBDC design choices are not merely technical questions. They have policy and legal implications. This is why we are devoting so much attention to every detail.

If and when the time comes, we want to be ready – and we will be ready."

To this end, we have set up a task force on a CBDC within the Eurosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me give you a preview of our deliberations, starting with different design options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Legally solid despite fancy design?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the money issued by central banks is in fact already digital, albeit not called CBDC. This is true for the bulk of the money issued through our wholesale credit operations with our counterparties. At present, access to the central bank balance sheet offers the possibility to access digital central bank money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could change in the future is the scope of the parties eligible to access our central bank balance sheets. Indeed, this lies at the heart of the discussion on CBDCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A wholesale CBDC, restricted to a limited group of financial counterparties, would be largely business as usual. However, a retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer. So a retail CBDC is now our main focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a CBDC would require a solid legal basis, in line with the principle of conferral under EU law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key consideration here is whether a retail CBDC could and should have the same legal tender status as banknotes and coins. In practice, legal tender status implies that a CBDC would have to be usable at any location and under any condition, possibly even offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without legal tender status, the legal basis would need to be clarified, as would the relationship between a CBDC and euro banknotes and coins, along with the process by which one could be exchanged for the other. Should it not be acknowledged that the ECB’s exclusive right to authorise issuance in euro would also be applicable to a digital issuance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A retail CBDC could be based on digital tokens, which would circulate in a decentralised manner – that is without a central ledger – and allow for anonymity towards the central bank, similar to cash. Some argue that a token-based digital currency might not guarantee complete anonymity. If that proved to be the case, it would inevitably raise social, political and legal issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are currently looking into the legal questions raised by the potential use of intermediaries to facilitate the circulation of a CBDC and also the processing of transactions in a CBDC. To what extent are we permitted to outsource public law tasks to private entities? And what would be the appropriate extent of supervision over such entities?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, a retail CBDC could be based on deposit accounts with the central bank. Though involving vast numbers of accounts, it would not be a particularly innovative option from a technological viewpoint. For the euro area, it would basically mean increasing the number of current deposit accounts offered from around ten thousand to between 300 and 500 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CBDC of this nature would enable the central bank to register transfers between users, thereby providing protection against money laundering and other illicit uses (or those considered illicit by the rulers of the day), depending on the degree of privacy granted to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just two of the many ways to design a CBDC. We are currently scrutinising the various options to assess their potential impact – both positive and negative – on the financial system and on our ability to honour our mandate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Disintermediation – economically inefficient and legally untenable</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>You may wonder why central banks have not chosen to provide retail access to central bank money, despite the technology for an account-based CBDC already being largely available. The main reason is that introducing a retail CBDC could have major consequences for the financial system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If households were able to convert commercial bank deposits into a CBDC at a rate of 1 to 1, they may find it far more attractive to hold a risk-free CBDC rather than bank deposits. During a systemic banking crisis, this could trigger digital bank runs of unprecedented speed and scale, magnifying the effects of such a crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks might manage to render their deposits more attractive than central bank ones. They could, for instance, provide additional services to those offered by central banks. Such services could include paying bills, or cross-selling financial insurance products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise – even in the absence of a crisis – a readily convertible CBDC could crowd out bank deposits, leading to the disintermediation of the banking sector. This could have far-reaching implications for the structure of the financial system and for the ability of central banks to perform their core tasks and ensure that their monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the central bank were to take retail deposits, it might also have to provide loans, with all the ensuing consequences. The central bank would need to launch customer-facing business lines. Deposit and lending facilities would also require the central bank to take on the burden of regulatory compliance in areas such as anti-money laundering, consumer protection and confidentiality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some argue that this may reinforce monetary sovereignty, as disintermediation would make the financial system safer and reduce the moral hazard of banks by diminishing their role in money creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But disintermediation would be economically inefficient and legally untenable. The EU Treaty provides for the ECB to operate in an open market economy, essentially reflecting a policy choice in favour of decentralised market decisions on the optimal allocation of resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historical cases of economy-wide resource allocation by central banks are hardly models of efficiency or good service. Furthermore, a retail CBDC would create a disproportionate concentration of power in the central bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These potentially highly adverse effects on the financial system would appear to outweigh the benefits envisaged by the introduction of a retail CBDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, then, could be done to mitigate the impact of a CBDC on the financial system?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One option could be to remunerate CBDC at below-market rates in order to create incentives for non-banks to rely more on market-based alternatives rather than on central bank deposits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback would be that, in times of crisis, it may become necessary to apply highly negative rates, which could generate criticism from the public and substantially undermine public confidence in the central bank as well as in the basic values of saving which underlie our societies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is a tiered remuneration system. In line with the functions of money, the first tier couldserve as a means of payment. The central bank would have to refrain from setting a lower or a negative interest rate in order to keep a CBDC attractive to the public as a means of payment. While the second tier could serve as a store of value, the central banks could discourage people from using it as such by setting unattractive interest rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, such schemes should draw from the experience of multiple exchange rate regimes. And the repercussions of the intentional use of such schemes need to be subjected to an additional comprehensive investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have plenty of questions on CBDC to discuss. In monitoring the evolution and uses of technology, the ECB respects technological neutrality. We do not serve technology – technology serves us. We will only introduce a digital currency if we become firmly convinced that it is both necessary and proportionate to fulfil our tasks in ensuring the stability of our currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, we take a keen interest in digital innovation and in the changing expectations of money users, and we are refining our thinking on CBDC – both within the ECB, the Eurosystem and in the international central banking community. CBDC design choices are not merely technical questions. They have policy and legal implications. This is why we are devoting so much attention to every detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If and when the time comes, we want to be ready – and we will be ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=""has-small-font-size""><em>The views and opinions expressed in this Viewpoint article are solely those of the author(s) and does not reflect the views and opinions of Fintech Bulletin.</em></p>\n<div class=""mh-social-bottom"">\n<div class=""mh-share-buttons clearfix"">\n\t<a class=""mh-facebook"" href=""#"" onclick=""window.open(\'https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F&amp;t=An+ECB+digital+currency+%E2%80%93+a+flight+of+fancy%3F\', \'facebookShare\', \'width=626,height=436\'); return false;"" title=""Share on Facebook"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-facebook""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-twitter"" href=""#"" onclick=""window.open(\'https://twitter.com/share?text=An+ECB+digital+currency+%E2%80%93+a+flight+of+fancy%3F:&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F\', \'twitterShare\', \'width=626,height=436\'); return false;"" title=""Tweet This Post"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-twitter""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-linkedin"" href=""#"" onclick=""window.open(\'https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F&amp;source=\', \'linkedinShare\', \'width=626,height=436\'); return false;"" title=""Share on LinkedIn"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-linkedin""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-pinterest"" href=""#"" onclick=""window.open(\'https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F&amp;media=https://fintech-bulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/maryna-yazbeck-pyzjoMvyCmw-unsplash-scaled.jpg&amp;description=An+ECB+digital+currency+%E2%80%93+a+flight+of+fancy%3F\', \'pinterestShare\', \'width=750,height=350\'); return false;"" title=""Pin This Post"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-pinterest""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-googleplus"" href=""#"" onclick=""window.open(\'https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en-US&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F\', \'googleShare\', \'width=626,height=436\'); return false;"" title=""Share on Google+"" target=""_blank"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-google-plus""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-email"" href=""mailto:?subject=An%20ECB%20digital%20currency%20%E2%80%93%20a%20flight%20of%20fancy%3F&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ffintech-bulletin.com%2Fan-ecb-digital-currency-a-flight-of-fancy%2F"" title=""Send this article to a friend"" target=""_blank"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-envelope-o""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n\t<a class=""mh-print"" href=""javascript:window.print()"" title=""Print this article"">\n\t\t<span class=""mh-share-button""><i class=""fa fa-print""></i></span>\n\t</a>\n</div></div>\n\t</div>', 'articleBodyHtml': '<article>\n\n<figure><img src=""https://fintech-bulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/maryna-yazbeck-pyzjoMvyCmw-unsplash-678x381.jpg"" alt="""" title=""maryna-yazbeck-pyzjoMvyCmw-unsplash""></figure>\n\n<p><em>Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the <a href=""https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html"">European Central Bank (ECB)</a> and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board, provides insight into the ECB’s work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</em></p>\n\n<p>A recent survey among 66 central banks by the <a href=""http://www.bis.org/"">Bank for International Settlements</a> shows that more than 80% are working on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

375	Shakshi	Said Ahmad SUNGKAR	Individual	https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2167.aspx	"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated two individuals based in Indonesia for their links to the terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT). Said Ahmad Sungkar has been involved in fundraising efforts for JAT and supporting JI operatives. Afif Abdul Majid is a senior JAT leader who has overseen the recruitment and training of terrorists in Indonesia. These designations are part of the Treasury Department’s ongoing efforts to target these organizations as well as disrupt their financial and logistical support networks.

“The threats posed by terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiya and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

JI is a Southeast Asia-based terrorist network with links to al-Qaida. It has been designated by the UN and the United States since 2002 and is responsible for numerous acts of terrorism including the Bali bombing in 2002, in which over 200 people from 27 nations were killed.

JAT is also an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to JI. In February 2012 the State Department designated JAT pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, while the Department of the Treasury designated three JAT leaders: JAT’s acting Emir Mochammad Achwan, JAT spokesperson Son Hadi bin Muhadjir, and JAT leadership figure Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba'asyir, who was involved in recruiting and fundraising activities.

JAT seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia, and has carried out numerous attacks on Indonesian Government personnel and civilians in order to achieve this goal. Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, the founder and leader of JAT, and a UN 1267 listed individual, was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2011 for his role in organizing a terrorist training camp in Aceh.

Said Ahmad Sungkar

Said Ahmad Sungkar (Sungkar) is being designated for providing financial, material, or technological support, or financial or other services, to JI and JAT. Sungkar has been involved in supporting Indonesia-based JI and JAT terrorist networks over a number of years. Most recently, Sungkar conducted fundraising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.

Sungkar previously had served as JI’s media chief. Also, on several occasions, Sungkar has extended logistics support to JI operatives seeking to evade capture and provided extremist operatives with fake documents.

In addition to providing support and services to JI and JAT Sungkar was linked to a terrorist training camp in 2010 in Aceh, Indonesia, that was under the leadership of senior JI operative Joko Pitono (a.k.a. Dulmatin) and gathered militants from various regional groups, including some with links to al-Qa’ida. The militants, using the name “al-Qa'ida in Aceh,” plotted to kill U.S. aid workers and Western tourists and attack churches and Western NGOs. Dulmatin was killed in an Indonesian police raid in March 2010.

Afif Abdul Majid

Afif Abdul Majid (Abdul Majid) is being designated for acting for or on behalf of JAT. Abdul Majid since 2008 has served as a JAT leader, overseeing JAT fighters. In 2012, Abdul Majid played a role in coordinating the activities of regional JAT leaders. Abdul Majid was a member of JAT’s governing council, also called the “Majelis Syuro,” from 2008 to 2013.

Abdul Majid also served as the head of JAT’s Central Java branch, as of late 2011. Abdul Majid in August 2010 conducted a swearing in ceremony for hundreds of JAT fighters, some of whom were expected to take violent action against the Indonesian police. In past years, Abdul Majid headed JAT recruitment efforts for a paramilitary wing that provided training for fighters, weapons experts, and hackers.

Abdul Majid has supported training activities for terrorist networks outside JAT, as well. As of early 2010, Abdul Majid donated approximately $2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp, including weapons and ammunition purchases.

335	Darya	Mallinckrodt Plc	company	https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2b07511c-7f1a-4c5c-9279-e6d2b30de99e	"On April 16, 2020, the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) issued a Statement of Charges and Notice of Hearing against Irish pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc and several of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, “Mallinckrodt”). [1] The administrative hearing will take place on August 24, 2020, before a hearing officer appointed by the DFS Superintendent. According to DFS, Mallinckrodt committed insurance fraud in violation of New York law by allegedly misrepresenting the efficacy and safety of opioids to patients and healthcare professionals, causing an over-prescription of its drugs, the cost of which was ultimately passed on to New York insurance companies and their policyholders.

This action follows Governor Cuomo’s announcement in September 2019 that DFS was “taking action” to seek fines and restitution from opioid manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy benefit managers for the costs New Yorkers had shouldered for the “over-prescription of opioids, addiction treatment and treatment of other adverse health effects associated with opioid addiction.” [2]

DFS’s invocation of an insurance-fraud theory of liability represents “a new front against opioid makers” in New York [3] and a novel and aggressive use of the relevant statutory provisions. This action also gives further insight into Superintendent Lacewell’s approach to enforcement, showing DFS’s heightened focus in the areas of consumer protection and healthcare. Below, we discuss DFS’s key factual allegations and legal theories.

Factual Allegations

Mallinckrodt manufactures a variety of name-brand (e.g., Exalgo) and generic (e.g., Percocet) opioids, a class of painkillers derived from opium. [4] Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, DFS alleges, Mallinckrodt conducted “a deliberately false and misleading marketing and promotional campaign” designed to convince healthcare professionals and patients that the benefits of using opioids to treat chronic pain outweighed the risks, and that opioids could be safely used by most patients. [5] To that end, Mallinckrodt allegedly:

Developed and disseminated “seemingly truthful” scientific, educational, and marketing materials that misrepresented the safety and efficacy of long-term opioid use; [6]
Paid sales representatives to deliver misleading messages about opioids to healthcare professionals; [7]
Recruited and funded healthcare providers to draft misleading studies and present deceptive and misleading continuing medical education programs; [8]
Helped develop and fund “seemingly independent, objective” advocacy groups that developed false and misleading educational materials and treatment guidelines that promoted long-term opioid use; [9] and
Failed to identify, report, and halt suspicious orders of opioids and opioid diversion. [10]

The result of these promotional efforts, DFS asserts, was a “dramatic increase[]” in “medically necessary” prescriptions of opioid medications, and Mallinckrodt’s drugs in particular. [11] Between 2009 and 2019, Mallinckrodt allegedly supplied New York policyholders of private commercial health insurance with over 1 billion opioid pills. [12]

With this increase in opioid prescriptions, DFS alleges, came “debilitating” financial costs: “It is estimated that, just in the past 10 years, commercial health insurance companies in the State of New York (and ultimately the consumers who pay insurance premiums) have paid $1.8 billion in additional claims as a result of the opioid crisis.” [13]

DFS’s Legal Theories

Relying on its authority as “the sole insurance regulator in the State of New York” with the responsibility to investigate and “promote the reduction and elimination of fraud” with respect to insurance institutions and their customers, DFS charged that Mallinckrodt’s conduct contravened two New York statutes that prohibit insurance fraud and provide for civil penalties. [14]

A. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law

Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of the false claim) per commission against any person who has committed a “fraudulent insurance act” within the meaning of Section 176.05 of the Penal Law. [15] Section 176.05, in turn, defines a “fraudulent insurance act” as an act “committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud presents [or] causes to be presented . . . to or by an insurer . . . a claim for payment . . . that he or she knows to: (a) contain materially false information concerning any material fact thereto; or (b) conceal, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.” [16]

DFS’s allegation that Mallinckrodt committed “fraudulent insurance acts” appears to rely on the following causal chain: (i) Mallinckrodt’s alleged misrepresentations regarding the efficacy and safety of opioids; (ii) caused healthcare providers to write opioid prescriptions and file insurance claims for those prescriptions; and (iii) those insurance claims “carried with them” false representations that the prescribed opioids were medically necessary. [17]

In the alternative, DFS alleges that to the extent third parties (such as doctors who wrote fraudulent prescriptions) engaged in conduct that violated Section 176.05, Mallinckrodt is liable for such conduct because it “knowingly and with an intent to defraud, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned and/or intentionally aided such third parties in such conduct.” [18] Although DFS does not cite a statutory provision, this language appears to be drawn from the aiding and abetting offense in New York’s Penal Law. [19]

According to DFS, either theory of liability warrants a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of each claim) for each allegedly fraudulent prescription. [20]

DFS’s theory that Mallinckrodt instigated a third-party’s insurance fraud appears to constitute a novel use of Sections 403 and 176.05. The application of those provisions has been limited in the past to more direct causal theories. DFS has, for example, utilized Section 403 in guidance cautioning healthcare providers that the failure to collect co-payments without the insurer’s knowledge may constitute insurance fraud. [21] And the past prosecutions under Section 176.05 have primarily concerned the knowing submission by a provider or the insured of a false insurance claim. [22] Regarding DFS’s alternative theory, DFS provides no citation for its application of aiding-and-abetting principles to a Section 403 enforcement action.

B. Section 408 of the New York Financial Services Law

Section 408(a)(1)(A) of the New York Financial Services Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for the commission of any intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact “with respect to,” or involving any person offering to provide or providing, “financial products or services,” including commercial health insurance plans. [23]

DFS appears to be relying on a substantially similar causal chain as it did with the first theory described above. DFS appears to be arguing that because Mallinckrodt made alleged misrepresentations to healthcare providers and patients, and the healthcare providers in turn prescribed the opioids and filed claims with insurance companies, then Mallinckrodt’s statements are “with respect” to the insurance companies’ provision of insurance. Thus, whether Section 408 encompasses Mallinckrodt’s alleged conduct may turn on how broadly the phrase “with respect to” is interpreted, an issue with which courts have apparently not grappled. [24] Notably, DFS’s prior enforcement actions under Section 408 have primarily concerned misrepresentations made in connection with selling or providing financial products or services. [25]

Implications

Although a handful of similar insurance fraud actions have been filed elsewhere, [26] DFS’s enforcement action represents a “new front” against opioid manufacturers in New York. DFS’s legal theories—including their reliance on multi-step causal chains and, in one instance, aiding-and-abetting principles—represent a novel and aggressive application of New York law. As a result, should this action continue to be contested (it appears to be the first major administrative action—rather than a consent order—filed during Superintendent Lacewell’s tenure [27]) it would confront significant obstacles upon judicial review.

The action is also notable because Superintendent Lacewell has frequently highlighted consumer protection and healthcare as areas of focus, [28] and last year she undertook a reorganization to create a new “powerhouse” Consumer Protection and Financial Enforcement Division, led by Executive Deputy Superintendent Katherine Lemire. [29] The Mallinckrodt case may thus portend further aggressive enforcement in this space."

[1] The administrative hearing will take place on August 24, 2020, before a hearing officer appointed by the DFS Superintendent. According to DFS, Mallinckrodt committed insurance fraud in violation of New York law by allegedly misrepresenting the efficacy and safety of opioids to patients and healthcare professionals, causing an over-prescription of its drugs, the cost of which was ultimately passed on to New York insurance companies and their policyholders.\n\nThis action follows Governor Cuomo’s announcement in September 2019 that DFS was “taking action” to seek fines and restitution from opioid manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy benefit managers for the costs New Yorkers had shouldered for the “over-prescription of opioids, addiction treatment and treatment of other adverse health effects associated with opioid addiction.” [2]\n\nDFS’s invocation of an insurance-fraud theory of liability represents “a new front against opioid makers” in New York [3] and a novel and aggressive use of the relevant statutory provisions. This action also gives further insight into Superintendent Lacewell’s approach to enforcement, showing DFS’s heightened focus in the areas of consumer protection and healthcare. Below, we discuss DFS’s key factual allegations and legal theories.\n\nFactual Allegations\n\nMallinckrodt manufactures a variety of name-brand (e.g., Exalgo) and generic (e.g., Percocet) opioids, a class of painkillers derived from opium. [4] Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, DFS alleges, Mallinckrodt conducted “a deliberately false and misleading marketing and promotional campaign” designed to convince healthcare professionals and patients that the benefits of using opioids to treat chronic pain outweighed the risks, and that opioids could be safely used by most patients. [5] To that end, Mallinckrodt allegedly:\n\nDeveloped and disseminated “seemingly truthful” scientific, educational, and marketing materials that misrepresented the safety and efficacy of long-term opioid use; [6]\nPaid sales representatives to deliver misleading messages about opioids to healthcare professionals; [7]\nRecruited and funded healthcare providers to draft misleading studies and present deceptive and misleading continuing medical education programs; [8]\nHelped develop and fund “seemingly independent, objective” advocacy groups that developed false and misleading educational materials and treatment guidelines that promoted long-term opioid use; [9] and\nFailed to identify, report, and halt suspicious orders of opioids and opioid diversion. [10]\n\nThe result of these promotional efforts, DFS asserts, was a “dramatic increase[]” in “medically necessary” prescriptions of opioid medications, and Mallinckrodt’s drugs in particular. [11] Between 2009 and 2019, Mallinckrodt allegedly supplied New York policyholders of private commercial health insurance with over 1 billion opioid pills. [12]\n\nWith this increase in opioid prescriptions, DFS alleges, came “debilitating” financial costs: “It is estimated that, just in the past 10 years, commercial health insurance companies in the State of New York (and ultimately the consumers who pay insurance premiums) have paid $1.8 billion in additional claims as a result of the opioid crisis.” [13]\n\nDFS’s Legal Theories\n\nRelying on its authority as “the sole insurance regulator in the State of New York” with the responsibility to investigate and “promote the reduction and elimination of fraud” with respect to insurance institutions and their customers, DFS charged that Mallinckrodt’s conduct contravened two New York statutes that prohibit insurance fraud and provide for civil penalties. [14]\n\nA. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law\n\nSection 403 of the New York Insurance Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of the false claim) per commission against any person who has committed a “fraudulent insurance act” within the meaning of Section 176.05 of the Penal Law. [15] Section 176.05, in turn, defines a “fraudulent insurance act” as an act “committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud presents [or] causes to be presented . . . to or by an insurer . . . a claim for payment . . . that he or she knows to: (a) contain materially false information concerning any material fact thereto; or (b) conceal, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.” [16]\n\nDFS’s allegation that Mallinckrodt committed “fraudulent insurance acts” appears to rely on the following causal chain: (i) Mallinckrodt’s alleged misrepresentations regarding the efficacy and safety of opioids; (ii) caused healthcare providers to write opioid prescriptions and file insurance claims for those prescriptions; and (iii) those insurance claims “carried with them” false representations that the prescribed opioids were medically necessary. [17]\n\nIn the alternative, DFS alleges that to the extent third parties (such as doctors who wrote fraudulent prescriptions) engaged in conduct that violated Section 176.05, Mallinckrodt is liable for such conduct because it “knowingly and with an intent to defraud, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned and/or intentionally aided such third parties in such conduct.” [18] Although DFS does not cite a statutory provision, this language appears to be drawn from the aiding and abetting offense in New York’s Penal Law. [19]\n\nAccording to DFS, either theory of liability warrants a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of each claim) for each allegedly fraudulent prescription. [20]\n\nDFS’s theory that Mallinckrodt instigated a third-party’s insurance fraud appears to constitute a novel use of Sections 403 and 176.05. The application of those provisions has been limited in the past to more direct causal theories. DFS has, for example, utilized Section 403 in guidance cautioning healthcare providers that the failure to collect co-payments without the insurer’s knowledge may constitute insurance fraud. [21] And the past prosecutions under Section 176.05 have primarily concerned the knowing submission by a provider or the insured of a false insurance claim. [22] Regarding DFS’s alternative theory, DFS provides no citation for its application of aiding-and-abetting principles to a Section 403 enforcement action.\n\nB. Section 408 of the New York Financial Services Law\n\nSection 408(a)(1)(A) of the New York Financial Services Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for the commission of any intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact “with respect to,” or involving any person offering to provide or providing, “financial products or services,” including commercial health insurance plans.

According to DFS, Mallinckrodt committed insurance fraud in violation of New York law by allegedly misrepresenting the efficacy and safety of opioids to patients and healthcare professionals, causing an over-prescription of its drugs, the cost of which was ultimately passed on to New York insurance companies and their policyholders.</p>\n\n<p>This action follows Governor Cuomo’s announcement in September 2019 that DFS was “taking action” to seek fines and restitution from opioid manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy benefit managers for the costs New Yorkers had shouldered for the “over-prescription of opioids, addiction treatment and treatment of other adverse health effects associated with opioid addiction.”<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[2]</a></p>\n\n<p>DFS’s invocation of an insurance-fraud theory of liability represents “a new front against opioid makers” in New York<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[3]</a> and a novel and aggressive use of the relevant statutory provisions. This action also gives further insight into Superintendent Lacewell’s approach to enforcement, showing DFS’s heightened focus in the areas of consumer protection and healthcare. Below, we discuss DFS’s key factual allegations and legal theories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Factual Allegations</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mallinckrodt manufactures a variety of name-brand (e.g., Exalgo) and generic (e.g., Percocet) opioids, a class of painkillers derived from opium.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[4]</a> Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, DFS alleges, Mallinckrodt conducted “a deliberately false and misleading marketing and promotional campaign” designed to convince healthcare professionals and patients that the benefits of using opioids to treat chronic pain outweighed the risks, and that opioids could be safely used by most patients.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[5]</a> To that end, Mallinckrodt allegedly:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Developed and disseminated “seemingly truthful” scientific, educational, and marketing materials that misrepresented the safety and efficacy of long-term opioid use;<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[6]</a></li>\n<li>Paid sales representatives to deliver misleading messages about opioids to healthcare professionals;<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[7]</a></li>\n<li>Recruited and funded healthcare providers to draft misleading studies and present deceptive and misleading continuing medical education programs;<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[8]</a></li>\n<li>Helped develop and fund “seemingly independent, objective” advocacy groups that developed false and misleading educational materials and treatment guidelines that promoted long-term opioid use; <a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[9]</a> and</li>\n<li>Failed to identify, report, and halt suspicious orders of opioids and opioid diversion.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[10]</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>The result of these promotional efforts, DFS asserts, was a “dramatic increase[]” in “medically necessary” prescriptions of opioid medications, and Mallinckrodt’s drugs in particular.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[11]</a> Between 2009 and 2019, Mallinckrodt allegedly supplied New York policyholders of private commercial health insurance with over 1 billion opioid pills.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[12]</a></p>\n\n<p>With this increase in opioid prescriptions, DFS alleges, came “debilitating” financial costs: “It is estimated that, just in the past 10 years, commercial health insurance companies in the State of New York (and ultimately the consumers who pay insurance premiums) have paid $1.8 billion in additional claims as a result of the opioid crisis.”<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[13]</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>DFS’s Legal Theories</strong></p>\n\n<p>Relying on its authority as “the sole insurance regulator in the State of New York” with the responsibility to investigate and “promote the reduction and elimination of fraud” with respect to insurance institutions and their customers, DFS charged that Mallinckrodt’s conduct contravened two New York statutes that prohibit insurance fraud and provide for civil penalties.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[14]</a></p>\n\n<p>A. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law</p>\n\n<p>Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of the false claim) per commission against any person who has committed a “fraudulent insurance act” within the meaning of Section 176.05 of the Penal Law.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[15]</a> Section 176.05, in turn, defines a “fraudulent insurance act” as an act “committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud presents [or] causes to be presented . . . to or by an insurer . . . a claim for payment . . . that he or she knows to: (a) contain materially false information concerning any material fact thereto; or (b) conceal, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.”<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[16]</a></p>\n\n<p>DFS’s allegation that Mallinckrodt committed “fraudulent insurance acts” appears to rely on the following causal chain: (i) Mallinckrodt’s alleged misrepresentations regarding the efficacy and safety of opioids; (ii) caused healthcare providers to write opioid prescriptions and file insurance claims for those prescriptions; and (iii) those insurance claims “carried with them” false representations that the prescribed opioids were medically necessary.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[17]</a></p>\n\n<p>In the alternative, DFS alleges that to the extent third parties (such as doctors who wrote fraudulent prescriptions) engaged in conduct that violated Section 176.05, Mallinckrodt is liable for such conduct because it “knowingly and with an intent to defraud, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned and/or intentionally aided such third parties in such conduct.” <a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[18]</a> Although DFS does not cite a statutory provision, this language appears to be drawn from the aiding and abetting offense in New York’s Penal Law.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[19]</a></p>\n\n<p>According to DFS, either theory of liability warrants a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of each claim) for each allegedly fraudulent prescription.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[20]</a></p>\n\n<p>DFS’s theory that Mallinckrodt instigated a third-party’s insurance fraud appears to constitute a novel use of Sections 403 and 176.05. The application of those provisions has been limited in the past to more direct causal theories. DFS has, for example, utilized Section 403 in guidance cautioning healthcare providers that the failure to collect co-payments without the insurer’s knowledge may constitute insurance fraud.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[21]</a> And the past prosecutions under Section 176.05 have primarily concerned the knowing submission by a provider or the insured of a false insurance claim.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[22]</a> Regarding DFS’s alternative theory, DFS provides no citation for its application of aiding-and-abetting principles to a Section 403 enforcement action.</p>\n\n<p>B. Section 408 of the New York Financial Services Law</p>\n\n<p>Section 408(a)(1)(A) of the New York Financial Services Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for the commission of any intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact “with respect to,” or involving any person offering to provide or providing, “financial products or services,” including commercial health insurance plans.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[23]</a></p>\n\n<p>DFS appears to be relying on a substantially similar causal chain as it did with the first theory described above. DFS appears to be arguing that because Mallinckrodt made alleged misrepresentations to healthcare providers and patients, and the healthcare providers in turn prescribed the opioids and filed claims with insurance companies, then Mallinckrodt’s statements are “with respect” to the insurance companies’ provision of insurance. Thus, whether Section 408 encompasses Mallinckrodt’s alleged conduct may turn on how broadly the phrase “with respect to” is interpreted, an issue with which courts have apparently not grappled.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[24]</a> Notably, DFS’s prior enforcement actions under Section 408 have primarily concerned misrepresentations made in connection with selling or providing financial products or services.<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[25]</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although a handful of similar insurance fraud actions have been filed elsewhere,<a href=""https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/white-collar-regulatory-defense/publications/ny-dfs-files-enforcement-action-against-opioid-manufacturer-for-insurance-fraud?id=36548"">[26]</a> DFS’s enforcement action represents a “new front” against opioid manufacturers in New York.

The threat ""remains extremely high in the country,"" Darmanin said in a speech during a visit to France's internal security service the DGSI.

""The risk of terror of Sunni origin is the main threat that our country is facing,"" he added, promising a fight ""without let-up"".

He said 8,132 individuals had been registered on France's database of suspected Islamist radicals considered to be a potential security threat.

Fourteen alleged accomplices in the January 7-9, 2015 jihadist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly, a French policewoman and a Jewish supermarket go on trial in Paris on Wednesday.

All of the perpetrators were killed in the aftermath of the assaults but lawyers for the victims and prosecutors insist the trial will be a hugely important if potentially traumatic moment.

Speaking on France Info radio Monday, national anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard dismissed the idea that it was just ""little helpers"" going on trial.

""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons, a residence.

""All this is essential to the terrorist action,"" he said.

The January 2015 attacks heralded a wave of Islamist violence that left 258 people dead and raised unsettling questions about modern France's ability to preserve security and harmony for a multicultural society."

of terror attacks in France remains extremely high, says interior minister
180	Canberk	Salv	Company	https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/salv/	"Salv, an anti-money laundering (AML) startup founded by former TransferWise and Skype employees, has raised $2 million in seed funding.

The round is led by Fly Ventures, alongside Passion Capital and Seedcamp. Angel investors also participating include N26 founder Maximilian Tayenthal (who seems to be doing quite a bit of angel investing), former Twilio CTO Ott Kaukver, and Taavi Kotka, former CIO for Estonia (the actual country!).

Founded in June 2018 and initially offering consultancy, Estonia -based Salv has built a software platform that helps banks find and stop financial crime. The idea, says co-founder and CEO Taavi Tamkivi, is to move AML beyond just compliance to something more proactive that actually does defeat crime. That’s quite the promise, although he and his co-founders have a lot experience to draw from, both within fast-growing startups and AML.

Tamkivi built the AML, fraud, and Know Your Customer (KYC) teams at TransferWise and Skype . COO Jeff McClelland also worked in the anti-fraud team at Skype, followed by a stint at TransferWise, first as an analyst and then in HR. And CTO Sergei Rumjantsev was also formerly at TransferWise, leading the engineering team responsible for KYC and verification.

“This was a highly demanding role, especially given how fast TransferWise was growing, how many new markets were coming online, and how central user verification is for compliance,” Tamkivi tells me. “Under Sergei’s leadership, the team made the verification process incredibly smooth over time for genuine customers. But also robust enough to protect TransferWise from on-boarding bad actors”.

Bad actors within financial services are aplenty, of course. Yet, despite the European banking sector spending billions tackling the problem, it is estimated that only 1-2% of global money-laundering is detected.

“AML should be all about stopping money laundering but, particularly in the last decade, layer upon layer of regulations have been added for banks to comply with,” says Tamkivi. “This would be great if that meant that there was no more money laundering, but sadly, that’s a long way off. Today, between $1-2 trillion a year is still laundered. But the excessive regulations mean that nearly all of a bank’s compliance team’s effort goes into compliance. They have very little energy left to actually focus on improving their financial crime-fighting abilities. The software they’re using is similar, focused almost wholly on compliance, not crime-fighting”.

That is where Salv wants to step in, and Tamkivi says the main difference between the startup’s AML software and other existing solutions is a much greater emphasis on crime-fighting rather than a box-ticking compliance exercise.

“We’re aiming to create a transformation similar to what’s happened in virus scanning,” he says. “10-15 years ago virus scanners on everyone’s PCs were an enormous hassle, consumed tons of resources and stopped you from getting work done. The same is true in financial institutions today. They’re using outdated, heavy software and processes to handle AML. But today, virus scanning still happens, but nobody’s worried about it. It happens in the background, with few resources. We’ll do the same in the AML world”.

In addition, the Salv CEO claims that the company’s software is faster than competitors’ offerings, both in terms of set up time and integration, and making changes to the rules the system adheres to.

“Our system, by contrast, takes a month or less to set up and minutes to modify the rules,” he says. “As a result, our customers can take everything they learn today from new criminal patterns, encode it in automated rules tomorrow, and repeat that cycle every day to protect their bank. Moving fast is the only way to keep up with the innovative organised criminals moving millions or billions around the world”.

To that end, Salv already counts Estonian bank LHV as its first customer. “They offer a full suite of banking products across Estonia,” says Tamkivi. “They’re also active in London, in particular, supporting fintechs. We have another couple of customers in the Lithuanian fintech scene. One of those is DeVere e- Money” .

More generally, Salv’s product is said to be suitable for Tier 2 and Tier 3 banks, as well as regulated fintechs and challenger banks.

Meanwhile, the business model is straightforward enough. Salv charges a monthly subscription, while the price varies based on the number of active customers a bank or fintech has."

333	Shakshi	Muhammad KAWTHARANI	Individual	https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2147.aspx	"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated four members of Hizballah’s leadership responsible for operations throughout the Middle East, further exposing Hizballah’s pernicious activities that reach beyond the borders of Lebanon. These designations include senior members of Hizballah responsible for activities ranging from assisting fighters from Iraq to support the Assad regime in Syria, to making payments to various factions within Yemen, and to military leaders responsible for terrorist operations in Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and Iraq.

Belying Hizballah’s claim to be a domestic Lebanese “resistance” organization, its expansive global network seeks to extend its malign influence, and the influence of Hizballah’s patron Iran, throughout the Middle East and beyond. The Treasury Department will continue to combat Hizballah’s terrorist activity inside and outside Lebanon with all available tools and will continue to work with partners around the world to make it clear that Hizballah’s militant and extremist activities should not be tolerated by any nation.

“Whether ferrying foreign fighters to the front lines of the Syrian civil war or inserting clandestine operatives in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere, Hizballah remains a significant global terrorist threat,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “So long as Hizballah spreads instability, conducts terrorist attacks and engages in criminal and illicit activities around the world, we will continue to sanction Hizballah’s operatives, leaders and businesses, wherever they may be found.”

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters for acting for, or on behalf of Hizballah. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

Khalil Harb

In the years prior to Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Khalil Harb served as the deputy commander for Hizballah’s central military unit’s southern Lebanon region from 1988 to 1992, and as the commander for this region from 1992 to 1994. From 1994 to 1997, Harb served as the commander of Hizballah’s central military operations. By 2000, Harb supervised Hizballah military operations inside Israel, Jordan, Cyprus, and Turkey.

In late November 2000, Harb was given responsibility for overseeing work of the Islamic Resistance, including assisting with the smuggling of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives from Syria into the West Bank via Jordan. By late 2003, Harb was head of the Syrian/Jordan/Israel/Egypt operations unit, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Islamic Jihad council.

In March 2006, Harb served as Hizballah’s chief of military liaison with the Palestinian factions and Iran, dealing almost exclusively with Palestinians and Iranians inside and outside the territories. Prior to this posting, Harb had served as Hizballah’s chief of military special operations. During the summer of 2006, Harb was given command of a Hizballah special operations unit in southern Lebanon, which engaged the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in July 2006, at the Lebanese-Israeli border where IDF Special Forces entered Lebanon. In early 2007, Khalil Harb was chief of Hizballah’s Unit 1800, also known as Hizballah’s Nun Unit, the Hizballah entity responsible for supporting Palestinian militants and conducting Hizballah operations in the countries surrounding Israel, and he travelled to Iran for meetings regarding coordination between Hizballah, Iran, and the Palestinians.

In February 2010, Harb, serving as the leader of the Palestinian activities for Hizballah, planned unspecified attacks against Israeli officials in Israel, in retaliation for the assassination of former Hizballah External Security Organization (ESO) chief Imad Mughniyah. By mid-May 2010, Hizballah created a new position for Harb as “advisor to the Secretary General,” which provided Harb oversight of Hizballah Unit 1800, which he previously commanded.

As of 2012, Harb was responsible for Hizballah’s Yemen activities and was involved in the political side of Hizballah’s Yemen portfolio. Harb also served as commander of a Lebanon-based Hizballah special unit that focused on Israel. Since the summer of 2012, Harb has been involved in the movement of large amounts of currency to Yemen, through Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., and in late 2012, Harb advised the leader of a Yemeni political party that the party’s monthly Hizballah funding of $50,000 was ready for pick up.

Muhammad Kawtharani

As the individual in charge of Hizballah's Iraq activities, Kawtharani has worked on behalf of Hizballah's leadership to promote the group's interests in Iraq, including Hizballah efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi Shi'a insurgent groups. A member of Hizballah's Political Council, Kawtharani also helped secure the release from Iraqi custody of Hizballah operative Ali Musa Daqduq, a senior Hizballah commander designated by the Treasury Department in November 2012 who was responsible for numerous attacks against Coalition Force in Iraq, including planning a January 20, 2007 attack on the Karbala Joint Provincial Coordination Center that resulted in the deaths of five U.S. soldiers.

Over the last year, Kawtharani has assisted in getting fighters to Syria to support the Assad regime.

Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur

Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur (Mansur), a member of Hizballah since at least 1986, once served in a Hizballah military unit operating in south Lebanon. Around 2004, Mansur was transferred to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. Mansur was subsequently dispatched to Egypt to work with Unit 1800 under Muhammad Qabalan, and in 2008, the cell escalated its operations to target tourist destinations in Egypt. Mansur served as the Egypt-based cell leader. By early 2009, Egyptian authorities had disrupted the Hizballah cell and arrested and detained Mansur and dozens of other individuals for planning to carry out terrorist operations against Israeli and other tourists in Egypt. Hizballah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in November 2009 publicly acknowledged that Mansur was a Hizballah member involved in transporting arms and equipment to Palestinian militants. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Mansur to 15 years for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. However, in late January 2011, the imprisoned members of the Hizballah cell escaped and Mansur returned to Lebanon. In February 2011, Mansur appeared on Lebanese television with Hizballah officials at a Hizballah rally in Beirut.

Muhammad Qabalan

Hizballah terrorist cell leader Muhammad Qabalan (Qabalan) once served as the head of a Hizballah infantry platoon. In 2008, Qabalan, as a leader in Hizballah’s Unit 1800, was serving as the Lebanon-based head of the Hizballah Egypt-based terrorist cell targeting tourist destinations in Egypt and was coordinating the cell’s activities from Lebanon. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Qabalan in absentia to life imprisonment for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. As of late 2011, Qabalan worked in a separate Hizballah covert unit operating in the Middle East.

Harb also served as commander of a Lebanon-based Hizballah special unit that focused on Israel. Since the summer of 2012, Harb has been involved in the movement of large amounts of currency to Yemen, through Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., and in late 2012, Harb advised the leader of a Yemeni political party that the party’s monthly Hizballah funding of $50,000 was ready for pick up.\n\nMuhammad Kawtharani\n\nAs the individual in charge of Hizballah's Iraq activities, Kawtharani has worked on behalf of Hizballah's leadership to promote the group's interests in Iraq, including Hizballah efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi Shi'a insurgent groups. A member of Hizballah's Political Council, Kawtharani also helped secure the release from Iraqi custody of Hizballah operative Ali Musa Daqduq, a senior Hizballah commander designated by the Treasury Department in November 2012 who was responsible for numerous attacks against Coalition Force in Iraq, including planning a January 20, 2007 attack on the Karbala Joint Provincial Coordination Center that resulted in the deaths of five U.S. soldiers.\n\nOver the last year, Kawtharani has assisted in getting fighters to Syria to support the Assad regime.\n\nMuhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur\n\nMuhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur (Mansur), a member of Hizballah since at least 1986, once served in a Hizballah military unit operating in south Lebanon. Around 2004, Mansur was transferred to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. Mansur was subsequently dispatched to Egypt to work with Unit 1800 under Muhammad Qabalan, and in 2008, the cell escalated its operations to target tourist destinations in Egypt. Mansur served as the Egypt-based cell leader. By early 2009, Egyptian authorities had disrupted the Hizballah cell and arrested and detained Mansur and dozens of other individuals for planning to carry out terrorist operations against Israeli and other tourists in Egypt. Hizballah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in November 2009 publicly acknowledged that Mansur was a Hizballah member involved in transporting arms and equipment to Palestinian militants. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Mansur to 15 years for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. However, in late January 2011, the imprisoned members of the Hizballah cell escaped and Mansur returned to Lebanon. In February 2011, Mansur appeared on Lebanese television with Hizballah officials at a Hizballah rally in Beirut.\n\nMuhammad Qabalan\n\nHizballah terrorist cell leader Muhammad Qabalan (Qabalan) once served as the head of a Hizballah infantry platoon. In 2008, Qabalan, as a leader in Hizballah’s Unit 1800, was serving as the Lebanon-based head of the Hizballah Egypt-based terrorist cell targeting tourist destinations in Egypt and was coordinating the cell’s activities from Lebanon. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Qabalan in absentia to life imprisonment for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. As of late 2011, Qabalan worked in a separate Hizballah covert unit operating in the Middle East.\n\nIdentifying Information\n\nName: Khalil Yusif Harb\n\nAKA: Khalil Yusuf Harb\n\nAKA: Hajj Ya’taqad Khalil Harb\n\nAKA: Mustafa Khalil Harb\n\nAKA: Sayyid Ahmad\n\nAKA: Abu Mustafa\n\nDOB: 9 October 1958\n\nName: Muhammad Kawtharani\n\nAKA: Muhammad Al-Kawtharani\n\nAKA: Mohammad Kawtharani\n\nAKA: Muhammad Kawtarani\n\nAKA: Jafar al-Kawtharani\n\nNationality #1: Lebanon\n\nNationality #2: Iraq\n\nDOB #1: 1945\n\nDOB #2: 1959\n\nDOB #3: 1961\n\nPOB: Najaf, Iraq\n\nName: Muhammad Qabalan\n\nAKA: Hassan al-Ghul\n\nAKA: Muhammad Qablan\n\nDOB: 1969\n\nCitizenship: Lebanese\n\nLocation: Southern Suburbs, Beirut, Lebanon\n\nName: Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur\n\nAKA: Sami Hani Shihab\n\nAKA: Salem Bassem Sami\n\nAKA: Jamal Hani Hillawi\n\nAKA: Muhammad Yusuf Mansur Sami Shihab\n\nAKA: Mohammad Yousef Mansour\n\nAKA: Mohammad Youssef Mansour\n\nAKA: Muhammad Yusuf Mansur\n\nAKA: Mohammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur\n\nAKA: Muhammad Yusif Ahmad Mansur\n\nAKA: Sami Shehab\n\nAKA: Sami Shihab\n\nAKA: Hani Halawi\n\nDOB No. 1: September 14, 1970\n\nDOB No. 2: January 1, 1974\n\nDOB No. 3: 1980\n\nPOB: Bint Jubayl, Lebanon\n\nLocation: Beirut, Lebanon\n\n###"", 'breadcrumbs': [{'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Home'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Press Center'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Press Releases'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2147.aspx', 'name': 'Treasury Sanctions Hizballah Leadership'}], 'description': 'WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated four members of Hizballah’s leadership responsible for operations throughout the Middle East, further exposing Hizballah’s pernicious activities that reach beyond the borders of Lebanon.

167	Darya	Craig Sutton	individual	https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-54062677	"A prisoner ran a two-year-long drug smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone and mail, a court has heard.

Craig Sutton, 37, carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.

The offences only came to light when Sutton's cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.

He will be sentenced in October.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit £30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.

The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.

Letters seized

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton's cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.

A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.

""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson's bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""

Prisons investigation

Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.

Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""

Lord Burns said: ""It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it."""

a court has heard.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Craig Sutton, 37,  carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.</p>\n\n<p>The offences only came to light when Sutton\'s cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.</p>\n\n<p>He will be sentenced in October.</p>\n\n<p>Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit £30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.</p>\n\n<h2>Letters seized</h2>\n\n<p>Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton\'s cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.</p>\n\n<p>A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.</p>\n\n<p>There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.</p>\n\n<p>Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.</p>\n\n<p>""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson\'s bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""</p>\n\n<h2>Prisons investigation</h2>\n\n<p>Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.</p>\n\n<p>Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""</p>\n\n<p>Lord Burns said: ""It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.""</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-09-07T15:22:21.000Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-09-07T15:22:21.000Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion':

84	Dan	Azem SYLA	Person	https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-thaci-party-member-indicted/28074637.html	"An international prosecutor has charged an ally of Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci with leading a crime ring responsible for a multimillion-dollar land scam and money laundering.

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) made the charges against Azem Syla and 38 associates on October 25.

Syla is a former member of parliament and prominent politician in Thaci's ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).

In a statement, Kosovo prosecutor's office said Syla's crime syndicate was involved in illegally acquiring public property in Kosovo worth around $33 million.

The prosecutor's office added that the 39 defendants cooperated ""to deprive Kosovo of socially owned properties through criminal activities including the falsification of verdicts and of other official documents, fraud and corrupt behavior.""

Prosecutors said the criminal gang had been operating since 2006.

Syla, 65, was arrested in April after he surrendered to authorities. He was a top commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War."

76	Canberk	Timothy Despain	Person	https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/former-enron-assistant-treasurer-timothy-despain-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-and-agrees-to-cooperate	"Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Andrew Weissmann, and Assistant Director Chris Swecker of the FBI announced today that Timothy Despain, the former assistant treasurer of Enron Corp., has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

Despain, 39, of Houston, Texas, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Ewing Werlein at U.S. District Court in Houston. As part of his plea, Despain has agreed to cooperate fully and truthfully with the Enron Task Force's ongoing criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron. Despain pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the loss.

The information and plea documents signed by Despain state that Despain was an Assistant Treasurer of Enron from approximately January 1999 until May 2002. Despain was responsible for coordinating interactions between Enron senior management and the national credit rating agencies who rated Enron's corporate debt. Despain admitted that from 1999 through the fall of 2001, he and his superiors engaged in conduct that he knew was intended to fraudulently manipulate Enron's credit rating. Despain admitted that he knew this rating was relied on by the holders and prospective purchasers of Enron's publicly traded stocks and bonds. Despain stated that during this time period he was supervised directly by the people who served as Enron's treasurers—including Ben Glisan, who pleaded guilty in September 2003 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence.

Despain admitted that in communicating with representatives of the rating agencies, he and others at Enron did not truthfully present the financial position and cash and funds flow of the company—key factors influencing the company's rating. Among other things, Despain admitted that he and others falsely represented to credit rating agencies that Enron's cash flows from its non-regulated businesses were stable and predictable. In fact, the annual cash flow targets that Enron set for itself and reported to the rating agencies were arbitrarily based on what he and others believed was necessary to maintain Enron's investment-grade credit rating, rather than on the amount of cash flow Enron's non-regulated businesses were expected to achieve.

One example of such an improper transaction was ""Project Nahanni."" Despain admitted that, in late 1999, Enron was at least $500 million short of the cash flow target it had artificially set and then told the national rating agencies it intended to achieve for 1999. In order to make up this shortfall, Enron entered into Project Nahanni, a transaction that resulted in Enron reporting the sale of $485 million of Treasury securities as cash flow from operations. Despain admitted that he and others knew that there was no business purpose to the Project Nahanni transaction, other than to achieve Enron's desired cash flow results. Moreover, the sale of Treasury securities should not have been characterized as a sale of a merchant asset and therefore should not have been included in the cash flow from operations figures presented to the rating agencies. This transaction occurred during a time in which Enron was actively pursuing a credit rating upgrade from one of the national credit rating agencies. Despain stated that he knew at the time of the Project Nahanni transaction that if the rating agencies understood that $485 million of the reported cash flow from operations for 1999 was from the sale of Treasury securities, Enron's credit rating would have been negatively affected, and Enron would not likely have received the desired upgrade in its credit rating.

Despain also admitted that another mechanism by which Enron achieved the artificial cash flow targets it set for itself was through transactions commonly referred to within the company as ""prepays."" The reporting of the cash received from these transactions was a means of demonstrating to the rating agencies Enron's ability to recognize cash from its mark-to-market trading book. Although the prepay transactions were accounted for as commodity transactions and reflected on Enron's books as a trading liability, the transactions in substance created debt-like obligations to the financial institutions that advanced funds to Enron through the transactions. Despain and others told the rating agencies that the cash generated from Enron's trading operations was from the sale or ""monetization"" of trading contracts or the future cash flow streams from those contracts.

The agencies were led to believe that Enron was generating cash by selling an asset, when in fact Enron was generating cash by incurring a future obligation that operated as debt. Over the course of Despain's time as Assistant Treasurer, Enron's obligations under the ""prepay"" transactions grew to approximately $5 billion. Despain stated that he was directed by Enron's treasurers not to reveal to, or discuss with the credit rating agencies the nature and extent of the prepay transactions entered into by Enron.

Despain and the treasurers recognized that if the rating agencies knew about the nature and extent of Enron's prepay transactions, such information would have had a materially negative effect on Enron's credit rating.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division. The Enron Task Force also has coordinated with and received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

To date, 33 defendants have been charged in connection with the work of the Enron Task Force, including 24 former Enron executives. With the plea today, 16 defendants have so far been convicted. The Enron Task Force has obtained more than $162 million in forfeiture for restitution to victims."

Despain stated that he knew at the time of the Project Nahanni transaction that if the rating agencies understood that $485 million of the reported cash flow from operations for 1999 was from the sale of Treasury securities, Enron\'s credit rating would have been negatively affected, and Enron would not likely have received the desired upgrade in its credit rating.</p>\n<p>Despain also admitted that another mechanism by which Enron achieved the artificial cash flow targets it set for itself was through transactions commonly referred to within the company as ""prepays.""

Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Andrew Weissmann, and Assistant Director Chris Swecker of the FBI announced today that Timothy Despain, the former assistant treasurer of Enron Corp., has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Despain, 39, of Houston, Texas, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Ewing Werlein at U.S. District Court in Houston. As part of his plea, Despain has agreed to cooperate fully and truthfully with the Enron Task Force\'s ongoing criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron. Despain pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the loss.</p>\n\n<p>The information and plea documents signed by Despain state that Despain was an Assistant Treasurer of Enron from approximately January 1999 until May 2002. Despain was responsible for coordinating interactions between Enron senior management and the national credit rating agencies who rated Enron\'s corporate debt. Despain admitted that from 1999 through the fall of 2001, he and his superiors engaged in conduct that he knew was intended to fraudulently manipulate Enron\'s credit rating. Despain admitted that he knew this rating was relied on by the holders and prospective purchasers of Enron\'s publicly traded stocks and bonds. Despain stated that during this time period he was supervised directly by the people who served as Enron\'s treasurers—including Ben Glisan, who pleaded guilty in September 2003 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Despain admitted that in communicating with representatives of the rating agencies, he and others at Enron did not truthfully present the financial position and cash and funds flow of the company—key factors influencing the company\'s rating. Among other things, Despain admitted that he and others falsely represented to credit rating agencies that Enron\'s cash flows from its non-regulated businesses were stable and predictable. In fact, the annual cash flow targets that Enron set for itself and reported to the rating agencies were arbitrarily based on what he and others believed was necessary to maintain Enron\'s investment-grade credit rating, rather than on the amount of cash flow Enron\'s non-regulated businesses were expected to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>One example of such an improper transaction was ""Project Nahanni."" Despain admitted that, in late 1999, Enron was at least $500 million short of the cash flow target it had artificially set and then told the national rating agencies it intended to achieve for 1999. In order to make up this shortfall, Enron entered into Project Nahanni, a transaction that resulted in Enron reporting the sale of $485 million of Treasury securities as cash flow from operations. Despain admitted that he and others knew that there was no business purpose to the Project Nahanni transaction, other than to achieve Enron\'s desired cash flow results. Moreover, the sale of Treasury securities should not have been characterized as a sale of a merchant asset and therefore should not have been included in the cash flow from operations figures presented to the rating agencies. This transaction occurred during a time in which Enron was actively pursuing a credit rating upgrade from one of the national credit rating agencies.

112	Wanting	Cyprus bank	company	https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/cyprus-banks-challenging-money-laundering-associations	"Banks in Cyprus are concerned that their adoption of some of the toughest anti-money laundering regulations in the world has not been fully recognized abroad, the chief of the Association of Cyprus Banks said Monday.

Association Director Michalis Kammas said that banks are challenging ""outdated perceptions"" and are working to raise awareness about reform efforts.

Kammas says more rigorous supervision and directives have led to the closure of a ""significant number"" of bank accounts since 2014.

""Today, Cypriot banks' procedures encompass some of the most advanced banking compliance practices globally,"" Kammas told the Associated Press in an email.

Kammas said international supervisory bodies like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Transparency International have recognized Cyprus' strong efforts but that the message hadn't gotten through to some stakeholders, including the media.

Prior to a 2013 banking sector crisis that brought Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy, the east Mediterranean island nation, which is an EU member, was hounded by allegations that it was a tax and money laundering haven.

Kammas said the crisis hit home with Cypriot authorities that they had to clean up the banking system and that pressure to do so had come ""as much from political commitment within as it has from outside authorities.""

He said Cyprus is working closely with foreign supervisory authorities from the EU and the U.S. to ensure that financial sector legislation is fully in line with international best practices.

Some of the key reforms include obligatory face-to-face meetings between banks and account owners and strong regulations on disclosing the individual who is the ultimate holder of a bank account.

Earlier this year, Cyprus also introduced new shell company regulations that prohibit Cypriot banks from doing business with entities that are identified as shell companies."

Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the laws, regulations and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. Though anti-money laundering laws cover a limited range of transactions and criminal behavior, their implications are far-reaching. For example, AML regulations require banks and other financial institutions that issue credit or accept customer deposits to follow rules that ensure they are not aiding money-laundering.﻿

How Anti Money Laundering Works

AML laws and regulations target criminal activities including market manipulation, trade in illegal goods, corruption of public funds and tax evasion, as well as the methods used to conceal these crimes and the money derived from them.

Criminals often ""launder"" money they obtain through illegal acts such as drug trafficking so the funds cannot be easily traced to them. One common technique is to run the money through a legitimate cash-based business owned by the criminal organization or its confederates. The supposedly legitimate business deposits the money, which the criminals can then withdraw.

Money launderers may also sneak cash into foreign countries to deposit, deposit cash in smaller increments to avoid arousing suspicion, or use illicit cash to buy other cash instruments. Launderers will sometimes invest the money, using dishonest brokers willing to ignore the rules in return for large commissions.

One rule in place is the AML holding period, which requires deposits to remain in an account for a minimum of five trading days. This holding period is intended to help in anti-money laundering and risk management.

Reporting Suspicious Activity

It's up to financial institutions to monitor customer deposits and other transactions to ensure they aren't part of a money-laundering scheme. The institutions must verify the origin of large sums, monitor suspicious activities, and report cash transactions exceeding $10,000.﻿ ﻿ In addition to complying with AML laws, financial institutions must ensure clients are aware of them.

Money-laundering investigations by law enforcement often involve scrutinizing financial records for inconsistencies or suspicious activity. In today's regulatory environment, extensive records are kept on just about every significant financial transaction. So when police attempt to trace a crime to its perpetrators, few methods are more effective than examining the records of connected financial transactions.

In cases of robbery, embezzlement or larceny, law enforcement are often able to return the funds or property uncovered during a money-laundering investigation to the victims of the crime. For example, if an agency discovers money a criminal laundered to cover up embezzlement, the agency can usually trace it back to those from whom the funds were embezzled.

AML vs. KYC

While closely related, there is a difference between AML and know your client (KYC) rules.﻿ In banking, KYC rules are the steps institutions must take to verify their customers' identities. AML operates on a broader level: they are the measures institutions take to prevent and combat money laundering, terrorism financing and other financial crimes. Banks use AML and KYC compliance to maintain secure financial institutions.

History of Anti Money Laundering

Anti-money laundering initiatives rose to global prominence in 1989, when a group of countries and organizations around the world formed the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Its mission is to devise international standards to prevent money laundering and promote their implementation. In October 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, FATF expanded its mandate to include combating terrorist financing.﻿

Another important organization in the fight against money laundering is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Like the FATF, the IMF has pressed its 189 member countries to comply with international standards to thwart terrorist financing.﻿"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605093958169-95c20b0114e0259e', 'domain': 'investopedia.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp', 'author': 'Somer Anderson', 'headline': 'Anti Money Laundering (AML)', 'mainImage': 'https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/K4gdozv5EGdlj_T5r9C6HbdzGeM=/2119x1414/filters:fill(auto,1)/judges-gavel-and-handcuffs-on-american-dollars-636192812-5b0bac1b7f8f4bcfbe25126a0b79bb4e.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'What Is Anti Money Laundering (AML)?\n\nAnti-money laundering (AML) refers to the laws, regulations and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.

239	Carel	Rachel Reeves	Individual	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households	"The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the £200bn of debt amassed by households.

The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households.

“ Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,” said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that “unstable personal finances” often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough.

The £200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same level it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages.

Field said people in his Birkenhead constituency on the Wirral were being pushed into destitution by the actions of loan sharks and finance companies that heaped extra pain on low income households with sky-high interest charges.

He said: “We need a commission to assess the current situation. There are so many moving parts that a proper investigation goes beyond the remit of any single committee.”

According to the Money Advice Service, there are now 8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts while the government’s official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted that unsecured consumer debt – which includes loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car financing – will soar as a proportion of national income over the next four years back above its previous peak in 2007.

Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West – who was speaking in a personal capacity – said she was shocked at the sharp rise in borrowing to finance new car purchases and soaring credit card debts.

“It is the government’s responsibility to understand the extent of the issue and who is the worst affected,” she said.

“When you have people right up the income scale being told by the banks not to worry that they can’t afford the price of a car, just borrow the money anyway,” Reeves said.

Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, on Monday called on the government to help craft a sustainable solution to enable vulnerable borrowers to obtain finance.

Reeves and Field said they were concerned that there were large gaps in the remits of the regulators given responsibility for monitoring Britain’s debts.

Neither the Bank of England, which monitors the banking sector, the FCA nor the OBR has an overarching responsibility to report to government about the UK’s debt position.

Reeves said the financial services industry needed to be more transparent about the level of indebtedness and subprime lending.

Field said regulators need to be more explicit about the extent of the damage to households and the economy from a shock that could be caused by an increase in unemployment or increased interest rates.

The detail of the Treasury select committee inquiry is still being worked out but Morgan said her ambition was take evidence “not just sitting in London”.

When she was standing to become chair of the committee after the election, Morgan had flagged the issue of household debt as one of the areas she felt needed closer examination. She wanted to look at “what it is about our households that accumulate debt”.

The aim was to “add something intelligent to the policy debate”, said Morgan.

A Treasury spokeswoman said the government was focused on supporting the growth of secure and better-paid jobs as the route out of debt. The increase in full-time jobs in the past two years and a higher minimum wage meant that fewer people were coping with low and erratic wages. She added that tighter rules on the financial services industry provided consumers with greater protection than before the 2008 crash.

She said: “We have fundamentally reformed the consumer credit market so that the Financial Conduct Authority now [has] robust powers to help consumers, such as protecting 760,0000 people with the new cap on payday loans. A record number of people are in work and we are helping them keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes and raising the ‘national living wage’.”

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Labour is deeply worried by the concerns raised by the Bank of England over the high levels of personal debt.”

A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, recently told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risked fresh action against reckless lending and warned of a looming “spiral of complacency” about mounting consumer debt. He added: “Household debt – like most things that are good in moderation – can be dangerous in excess.”

McDonnell said: “We believe this is an area where there is a need for government intervention, and we will be bring forward policy proposals on this matter.

“The last seven years has seen the Tories fail to tackle the fall in wages, which has also witnessed a surge in unsecured lending; as many families have been forced into debt in order to just make ends meet.”

Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, also supported calls for a public inquiry, adding that it would prove futile if it ignores “an economically destructive extreme Brexit that will push the indebted over the edge”.

Cable added: “The government must also immediately implement its manifesto commitment to introduce a ‘breathing space’ for people with problematic debt, conveniently forgotten since the election but now more urgent than ever.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605092349526-97afe1168685d0f2', 'domain': 'theguardian.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households', 'author': 'Jill Treanor', 'images': ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1949591888657f434007c5ae60ddadb2', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb6bdb0f28c5f6c011c29efee490631bcbfdad9a/0_152_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f718383aa815590a8a6679fb780e2ac8', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=7e585dcdb5bea95c55dfd4a8b48ac8a3', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb6bdb0f28c5f6c011c29efee490631bcbfdad9a/0_152_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=859a8c9c55bbe75f35aa409a080052c7'], 'headline': ""Public inquiry needed into UK's £200bn debt crisis, say senior MPs"", 'mainImage': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb6bdb0f28c5f6c011c29efee490631bcbfdad9a/0_152_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d3bd7771db0cd1af4cd1acdb6146519f', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the £200bn of debt amassed by households.\n\nThe call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households.\n\n“ Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,” said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that “unstable personal finances” often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough.\n\nThe £200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same level it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages.\n\nField said people in his Birkenhead constituency on the Wirral were being pushed into destitution by the actions of loan sharks and finance companies that heaped extra pain on low income households with sky-high interest charges.\n\nHe said: “We need a commission to assess the current situation. There are so many moving parts that a proper investigation goes beyond the remit of any single committee.”\n\nAccording to the Money Advice Service, there are now 8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts while the government’s official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted that unsecured consumer debt – which includes loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car financing – will soar as a proportion of national income over the next four years back above its previous peak in 2007.\n\nReeves, Labour MP for Leeds West – who was speaking in a personal capacity – said she was shocked at the sharp rise in borrowing to finance new car purchases and soaring credit card debts.\n\n“It is the government’s responsibility to understand the extent of the issue and who is the worst affected,” she said.\n\n“When you have people right up the income scale being told by the banks not to worry that they can’t afford the price of a car, just borrow the money anyway,” Reeves said.\n\nAndrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, on Monday called on the government to help craft a sustainable solution to enable vulnerable borrowers to obtain finance.\n\nReeves and Field said they were concerned that there were large gaps in the remits of the regulators given responsibility for monitoring Britain’s debts.\n\nNeither the Bank of England, which monitors the banking sector, the FCA nor the OBR has an overarching responsibility to report to government about the UK’s debt position.\n\nReeves said the financial services industry needed to be more transparent about the level of indebtedness and subprime lending.\n\nField said regulators need to be more explicit about the extent of the damage to households and the economy from a shock that could be caused by an increase in unemployment or increased interest rates.\n\nThe detail of the Treasury select committee inquiry is still being worked out but Morgan said her ambition was take evidence “not just sitting in London”.\n\nWhen she was standing to become chair of the committee after the election, Morgan had flagged the issue of household debt as one of the areas she felt needed closer examination. She wanted to look at “what it is about our households that accumulate debt”.\n\nThe aim was to “add something intelligent to the policy debate”, said Morgan.\n\nA Treasury spokeswoman said the government was focused on supporting the growth of secure and better-paid jobs as the route out of debt. The increase in full-time jobs in the past two years and a higher minimum wage meant that fewer people were coping with low and erratic wages. She added that tighter rules on the financial services industry provided consumers with greater protection than before the 2008 crash.\n\nShe said: “We have fundamentally reformed the consumer credit market so that the Financial Conduct Authority now [has] robust powers to help consumers, such as protecting 760,0000 people with the new cap on payday loans. A record number of people are in work and we are helping them keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes and raising the ‘national living wage’.”\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Labour is deeply worried by the concerns raised by the Bank of England over the high levels of personal debt.”\n\nA senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, recently told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risked fresh action against reckless lending and warned of a looming “spiral of complacency” about mounting consumer debt.

The increase in full-time jobs in the past two years and a higher minimum wage meant that fewer people were coping with low and erratic wages. She added that tighter rules on the financial services industry provided consumers with greater protection than before the 2008 crash.</p>\n<p>She said: “We have fundamentally reformed the consumer credit market so that the Financial Conduct Authority now [has] robust powers to help consumers, such as protecting 760,0000 people with the new cap on payday loans. A record number of people are in work and we are helping them keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes and raising the ‘national living wage’.” <br></p>\n<p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Labour is deeply worried by the concerns raised by the Bank of England over the high levels of personal debt.” </p>\n<p>A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, recently told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risked fresh action against reckless lending and warned of a looming “spiral of complacency” about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/21/uk-credit-debit-card-spending-borrowing-earnings"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">mounting consumer debt</a>. He added: “Household debt – like most things that are good in moderation – can be dangerous in excess.”</p>\n<p>McDonnell said: “We believe this is an area where there is a need for government intervention, and we will be bring forward policy proposals on this matter. </p>\n<p>“The last seven years has seen the Tories fail to tackle the fall in wages, which has also witnessed a surge in unsecured lending; as many families have been forced into debt in order to just make ends meet.”</p>\n<p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, also supported calls for a public inquiry, adding that it would prove futile if it ignores “an economically destructive extreme Brexit that will push the indebted over the edge”.</p>\n<p>Cable added: “The government must also immediately implement its manifesto commitment to introduce a ‘breathing space’ for people with problematic debt, conveniently forgotten since the election but now more urgent than ever.”</p>\n<div class=""after-article

households</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“</strong>Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,” said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that “unstable personal finances” often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough.</p>\n\n<p>The £200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same level it reached <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/31/fca-unauthorised-overdrafts-car-loan-market"" data-link-name=""in body link"">before the 2008 financial crisis</a> and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/migration-brexit-inflation-mark-carney-bank-of-england-wages"" data-link-name=""in body link"">interest rates were likely to rise</a> in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages.</p>\n\n<p>Field said people in his Birkenhead constituency on the Wirral were being pushed into destitution by the actions of loan sharks and finance companies that heaped extra pain on low income households with sky-high interest charges.</p>\n\n<p>He said: “We need a commission to assess the current situation. There are so many moving parts that a proper investigation goes beyond the remit of any single committee.”</p>\n\n<figure data-component=""image"" data-media-id=""de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e""><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households#img-2"" data-link-name=""Launch Article Lightbox"" data-is-ajax="""">\n\n\n\n<source sizes=""620px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7e585dcdb5bea95c55dfd4a8b48ac8a3 1240w"">\n<source sizes=""620px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f9bac7bc4c73d9eabcad264e77fecdd4 620w"">\n<source sizes=""605px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=efed3489e9aedae0da216c29e2062475 1210w"">\n<source sizes=""605px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bb6acdc5a492afc88adf769ac29150d5 605w"">\n<source sizes=""445px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=88149b1792235722c9a1e0101f2761bf 890w"">\n<source sizes=""445px"" srcset=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0953f3b615056b42fc60876d17702e0a 445w"">\n\n<img alt=""Frank Field: ‘We need a commission to assess the current situation.’"" src=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5bbd619890d685325f90161e0d2cf341f63e9e/0_319_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1949591888657f434007c5ae60ddadb2"">\n</source></source></source></source></source></source>\n  </a>\n\n<figcaption>\n\n\n\n  Frank Field: ‘We need a commission to assess the current situation.’ Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>According to the Money Advice Service, there are now <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/britain-debt-timebomb-fca-chief-crisis"" data-link-name=""in body link"">8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts</a> while the government’s official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted that unsecured consumer debt – which includes loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car financing – will soar as a proportion of national income over the next four years back above its previous peak in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West – who was speaking in a personal capacity – said she was shocked at the sharp rise in borrowing to finance <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/car-finance-debt-dealers-consumer-credit"" data-link-name=""in body link"">new car purchases</a> and soaring credit card debts.</p>\n\n<p>“It is the government’s responsibility to understand the extent of the issue and who is the worst affected,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>“When you have people right up the income scale being told by the banks not to worry that they can’t afford the price of a car, just borrow the money anyway,” Reeves said.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, on Monday called on the government to help craft a sustainable solution to enable vulnerable borrowers to obtain finance.<br></p>\n\n<p>Reeves and Field said they were concerned that there were large gaps in the remits of the regulators given responsibility for monitoring Britain’s debts.</p>\n\n<p>Neither the Bank of England, which monitors the banking sector, the FCA nor the OBR has an overarching responsibility to report to government about the UK’s debt position.</p>\n\n<p>Reeves said the financial services industry needed to be more transparent about the level of indebtedness and subprime lending.</p>\n\n<p>Field said regulators need to be more explicit about the extent of the damage to households and the economy from a shock that could be caused by an increase in unemployment or increased interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>The detail of the Treasury select committee inquiry is still being worked out but Morgan said her ambition was take evidence “not just sitting in London”.</p>\n\n<p>When she was standing to become chair of the committee after the election, Morgan had flagged the issue of household debt as one of the areas she felt needed closer examination. She wanted to look at “what it is about our households that accumulate debt”.<br></p>\n\n<p>The aim was to “add something intelligent to the policy debate”, said Morgan.</p>\n\n<p>A Treasury spokeswoman said the government was focused on supporting the growth of secure and better-paid jobs as the route out of debt. The increase in full-time jobs in the past two years and a higher minimum wage meant that fewer people were coping with low and erratic wages. She added that tighter rules on the financial services industry provided consumers with greater protection than before the 2008 crash.</p>\n\n<p>She said: “We have fundamentally reformed the consumer credit market so that the Financial Conduct Authority now [has] robust powers to help consumers, such as protecting 760,0000 people with the new cap on payday loans. A record number of people are in work and we are helping them keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes and raising the ‘national living wage’.” <br></p>\n\n<p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Labour is deeply worried by the concerns raised by the Bank of England over the high levels of personal debt.”</p>\n\n<p>A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, recently told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risked fresh action against reckless lending and warned of a looming “spiral of complacency” about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/21/uk-credit-debit-card-spending-borrowing-earnings"" data-link-name=""in body link"">mounting consumer debt</a>. He added: “Household debt – like most things that are good in moderation – can be dangerous in excess.”</p>\n\n<p>McDonnell said: “We believe this is an area where there is a need for government intervention, and we will be bring forward policy proposals on this matter.</p>\n\n<p>“The last seven years has seen the Tories fail to tackle the fall in wages, which has also witnessed a surge in unsecured lending; as many families have been forced into debt in order to just make ends meet.”</p>\n\n<p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, also supported calls for a public inquiry, adding that it would prove futile if it ignores “an economically destructive extreme Brexit that will push the indebted over the edge”.</p>\n\n<p>Cable added: “The government must also immediately implement its manifesto commitment to introduce a ‘breathing space’ for people with problematic debt, conveniently forgotten since the election but now more urgent than ever.”</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2017-11-27T16:47:46+0000', 'datePublishedRaw': '2017-09-19T13:50:07+0100'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	1	Doesnt contain any keywords but document's topic is mostly aligned with finance/taxes.

156	Sebastien			https://www.barrons.com/news/unafraid-pope-to-escalate-vatican-corruption-fight-01604071805	"Pope Francis is preparing to ramp up his fight against corruption in the Vatican, he said in an interview on Friday, weeks after the shock ousting of a cardinal over embezzlement accusations.

""I have had to change many things, and many more will soon change,"" the Argentine pontiff told Italy's Adnkronos news agency when asked about his anti-corruption strategy.

Pope Francis, elected in 2013 on a mandate of cleaning up after a series of scandals in the centuries-old institution, has reformed laws and fired top financial officials to bring the Vatican into line with international standards on transparency and money laundering.

In September, the 83-year old forced the resignation of Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a close adviser who has been accused of syphoning off funds destined for the poor to family members -- a charge he denies.

The pope's reforms have met fierce opposition, particularly among the Church's old guard.

Francis said in the interview that he had been warned years ago that if he ever became pope he should get a dog, and make sure it tasted all of his food -- and survived -- before eating it himself.

""Am I reckless? A bit careless? I wouldn't know,"" he said. ""I don't fear consequences against me. I'm not afraid of anything.""

241	Dan	Philip Righter	Person	https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-california-man-sold-fake-works-basquiat-warhol-sentenced-prison	"A California man has been sentenced to five years in prison for selling forged artworks. Philip Righter pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three felony charges of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax fraud as part of a counterfeit art scheme that he ran for roughly two years.

Topmost among Righter’s offenses is the sale of works he falsely claimed were originals by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol. Between 2016 and 2018, Righter used counterfeit paintings to conduct transactions in both his own name and under other people’s identities. To support his claims that the works were real, Righter created false provenance documents, going so far as to impersonate a member of Basquiat’s estate in his creation of a fraudulent certificate of authenticity. Over the course of his scheme, Righter attempted to sell roughly $6 million in counterfeit art.

He also attempted to use the fraudulent works as collateral for loans he later defaulted on, and also used their falsified value for write-offs on a tax return. One victim was defrauded of $24,000 after attempting to sell a fake Basquiat that Righter had used as loan collateral at auction. He also provided an online auction site with a Basquiat piece that sold for $50,000, which the site had to refund the buyer after the piece was proven to be fake. All told, Righter’s scheme cost victims at least $758,265, and the government around $100,000 in taxes.

Mexico’s General Law of Administrative Accountability, set to go into effect next week, is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico and will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement.

On July 19, 2017, Mexico’s General Law of Administrative Accountability will go into effect. It is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico or considering doing business in Mexico.

When the General Law of Administrative Accountability goes into effect, it will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement. Whereas the 2012 Public Contracting Anti-Corruption Law – the law repealed and replaced by the General Law of Administrative Accountability – was limited to the federal procurement space, the new law’s prohibitions apply to more conduct and in a wider business context.

First and foremost, the new law broadly defines prohibited “bribery” as: (1) where a private party offers or gives money or another gift to a public official to cause the official to do or refrain from doing any act related to the official’s functions; or (2) where a public official, directly or indirectly, solicits or receives for himself or another person, money or another gift in exchange for doing or refraining from doing any act related to the official’s functions. In turn, “public official” is broadly defined as any individual that has employment, a position, or a charge of any type in the Mexican government; government majority-owned companies; public trusts; or that handles federal economic resources.

Other notable prohibitions under the new law include: using or attempting to use influence or economic or political power on a public official in order to obtain a benefit or advantage or to damage any person; using false information during an administrative proceeding in order to obtain an authorization, benefit or advantage, or to damage any person; taking joint action with other private parties to obtain a benefit or advantage in a federal, state or municipal public procurement process; participating in administrative proceedings after being prohibited from doing so due to prior misconduct; misusing public resources (material, human, or financial); and hiring current or former government officials with privileged information for competitive advantage.

The new law applies to public servants and private parties, including both legal entities and individuals. This includes companies in Mexico and those based outside of Mexico, their affiliates and their officers who do business in Mexico and have direct or indirect contacts with Mexican officials. Further, a legal entity may be liable for offenses committed by its employees or third parties acting on behalf of the entity in order to obtain benefits for the entity.

Penalties for violating the new law can be severe. Individuals and companies face sanctions up to twice the amount of any acquired benefits, compensatory and/or punitive damages and/or a temporary ban on participating in procurement, leases, services or state-owned projects (e.g., projects with Pemex). Companies further face the brand new penalties of a temporary suspension of operations or dissolution.

However, Mexico’s new law also provides that sanctions shall be mitigated by 50-70 percent where a company self-reports past or ongoing misconduct and has implemented and enforced an adequate “Integrity Policy.” An “Integrity Policy” is defined to include, at a minimum: (1) a document setting forth the functions and responsibilities of each of the company’s areas, the leadership throughout the company and a clear chain of command; (2) a code of conduct with enforcement protocol; (3) control and audit systems that regularly supervise standards of compliance within the organization; (4) internal whistleblower and reporting systems that allow for appropriate reporting to enforcement authorities and disciplinary procedures for employees acting contrary to company policy or Mexican law; and (5) human resources policies for preventing the hiring of persons that may pose compliance risks to the organization.

Companies doing business or seeking to do business in Mexico should take action to inform themselves of the legal implications of the National Anti-Corruption System. This includes developing, implementing, enforcing and documenting an Integrity Policy that applies many of the risk assessment-based procedures and controls that are the hallmarks of a modern and effective compliance program."

It is the final part of a historic package of far-reaching anti-corruption laws, dubbed the National Anti-Corruption System, that were passed last year. Taken as a whole, the National Anti-Corruption System will have far-flung consequences for those doing business in Mexico or considering doing business in Mexico.</p>\n<p>When the General Law of Administrative Accountability goes into effect, it will expand the scope of potential anti-corruption enforcement. Whereas the 2012 Public Contracting Anti-Corruption Law – the law repealed and replaced by the General Law of Administrative Accountability – was limited to the federal procurement space, the new law’s prohibitions apply to more conduct and in a wider business context.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, the new law broadly defines prohibited “bribery” as: (1) where a private party offers or gives money or another gift to a public official to cause the official to do or refrain from doing any act related to the official’s functions; or (2) where a public official, directly or indirectly, solicits or receives for himself or another person, money or another gift in exchange for doing or refraining from doing any act related to the official’s functions. In turn, “public official” is broadly defined as any individual that has employment, a position, or a charge of any type in the Mexican government; government majority-owned companies; public trusts; or that handles federal economic resources.</p>\n<p>Other notable prohibitions under the new law include: using or attempting to use influence or economic or political power on a public official in order to obtain a benefit or advantage or to damage any person; using false information during an administrative proceeding in order to obtain an authorization, benefit or advantage, or to damage any person; taking joint action with other private parties to obtain a benefit or advantage in a federal, state or municipal public procurement process; participating in administrative proceedings after being prohibited from doing so due to prior misconduct; misusing public resources (material, human, or financial); and hiring current or former government officials with privileged information for competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>The new law applies to public servants and private parties, including both legal entities and individuals. This includes companies in Mexico and those based outside of Mexico, their affiliates and their officers who do business in Mexico and have direct or indirect contacts with Mexican officials. Further, a legal entity may be liable for offenses committed by its employees or third parties acting on behalf of the entity in order to obtain benefits for the entity.</p>\n<p>Penalties for violating the new law can be severe. Individuals and companies face sanctions up to twice the amount of any acquired benefits, compensatory and/or punitive damages and/or a temporary ban on participating in procurement, leases, services or state-owned projects (e.g., projects with Pemex). Companies further face the brand new penalties of a temporary suspension of operations or dissolution.</p>\n<p>However, Mexico’s new law also provides that sanctions shall be mitigated by 50-70 percent where a company self-reports past or ongoing misconduct and has implemented and enforced an adequate “Integrity Policy.” An “Integrity Policy” is defined to include, at a minimum: (1) a document setting forth the functions and responsibilities of each of the company’s areas, the leadership throughout the company and a clear chain of command; (2) a code of conduct with enforcement protocol; (3) control and audit systems that regularly supervise standards of compliance within the organization; (4) internal whistleblower and reporting systems that allow for appropriate reporting to enforcement authorities and disciplinary procedures for employees acting contrary to company policy or Mexican law; and (5) human resources policies for preventing the hiring of persons that may pose compliance risks to the organization.</p>\n<p>Companies doing business or seeking to do business in Mexico should take action to inform themselves of the legal implications of the National Anti-Corruption System.

Lopez Obrador's comments follow the Oct. 15 arrest of former Mexican army chief Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering on a warrant issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

""We have to review all of this: how these arrest warrants are issued, who is intervening, what agreements there are with U.S. agents who operate in Mexico,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lopez Obrador has criticized the DEA's historic role in his country, and last week Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard also expressed dismay at the United States' failure to tell Mexico it was going to arrest Cienfuegos. ""We have to be grateful, and I have said this before, that President Trump has been respectful (toward Mexico),"" Lopez Obrador said.

""But there are still issues we want to clarify. We're only waiting for the elections to pass,"" he said of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term. Lopez Obrador has held up the case of Cienfuegos, who is being held without bail, as an example of rampant corruption in past governments. But he characterized the case as an ""isolated"" event and defended the army's role in Mexico.

Cienfuegos was head of the army from 2012 to 2018."

70	Canberk	Nym Health	Company	https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/nym-health-raises-14-million-for-its-auditable-machine-learning-tools-for-automating-hospital-billing/	"A little less than two years after raising its seed round, the Israeli-based Nym Health has added another $16.5 million to its cash haul so it can roll out its technology developing auditable machine learning tools for automating hospital billing.

The new financing came from investors, including GV (the investment arm of Google previously known as Google Ventures), and will be used by the company to expand its technology development and sales and marketing efforts across the U.S.

Billing has been a huge problem for healthcare systems in the U.S., thanks to complicated coding that needs to be entered to ensure insurance providers pay for the services medical professionals give to patients.

Nym claims to have solved the problem by developing technologies that can convert medical charts and electronic medical records from physician’s consultations into proper billing codes automatically. The company uses natural language processing and taxonomies that were specifically developed to understand clinical language to determine the optimal charge for each procedure, examination and diagnostic conducted for a patient, according to Nym.

The company was founded in 2018 by two former members of Israel’s 8200 cybersecurity unit of the army. Adam Rimon and Amihai Neiderman both wanted to work on something together and Neiderman was set on doing something in the medical space involving natural language processing. Rimon had just finished a doctorate in computational linguistics, so the move into charting and medical coding seemed natural.

“Because of our approach we can generate full audit trails,” said Neiderman. “We can explain how we understood everything in patient charts.”

Having automated processes that are also auditable is important for healthcare providers in case they need to provide justification to insurance companies for the services they performed.

Nym’s software can’t address fraud if physicians are padding their bills with services they didn’t offer, but it can provide an audit and justification for the services that a hospital coded for — and potentially wring more money for hospitals that lose out thanks to improperly coded bills. “On the medical decision-making we never intervene. We assume that the physician is trying to do their best and they’re sticking to the protocol,” said Neiderman.

Interest in developing better billing systems for healthcare is high among venture investors, considering that coding related denials of payment can cost hospitals $15 billion, according to Nym. It’s a service that brought attention not just from GV, but Bessemer Venture Partners, Dynamic Loop Capital, Lightspeed, Tiger Global, and angel investors including Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner from Flatiron Health.

“Inaccurate coding is bad for everybody,” says Ben Robbins, a venture partner at GV.

Nym charges between $1 and $4 per chart it analyzes, and is already working with around 40 medical providers in the U.S., according to the company."

302	Sebastien	Brian Mulroney	individual	https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroney-from-scandal-adjacent-elitist-to-magnanimous-statesman/	"In March 2014, Mila Mulroney threw a surprise 75th birthday party for her husband at Palm Beach’s private Club Colette, a glitzy event that garnered gush from American gossip columns. “Billionaires party with former Canadian prime minister,” New York Post ’s Page Six announced, listing some of the Canadian and U.S. one-percenters present: oil baron and Tea Party funder David Koch; Seagram scion Charles Bronfman; investor Wilbur Ross; Galen Weston, executive chairman of George Weston Ltd.; and Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of New York-based Blackstone Group, the world’s largest private equity firm. Allies from his political days, including former Mulroney government cabinet minister and Quebec premier Jean Charest, mingled with newer friends like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. The Palm Beach Daily News counted “so many more richy-richies that if the ground had opened up beneath the building, Congress would have to rewrite the tax code.”

At the epicentre was Brian Mulroney, Canada’s 18th prime minister, regaling the crowd with a tale about announcing a political return to his wife: “I had been out of politics for some time, but I was really unhappy with some things that were going on in Canada,” he said. “So I sat her down and said, ‘Mila, I’m considering running for office again. How do you feel about that?’ And she answered, ‘Honey, I want you to do whatever makes you happy. And I’m sure your new wife will feel the same way.’ ”

The punchline drew riotous laughter. Even funnier was the notion that Mulroney would consider a return to politics given the circumstances around his departure—and the wealth and influence he’d amassed since leaving office three decades earlier: he was senior partner in the Montreal office of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright; he sat on the boards of Archer Daniels Midland, Barrick Gold Corp., Power Corp., Blackstone and Quebecor Inc., among many others; he pulled in more than $1 million a year on the speakers circuit; he and Mila had lived comfortably part of the year among the Palm Beach rich since they bought a house there in 1997.

Still, Mulroney couldn’t resist sparking political nostalgia as he joined the Canadian Tenors on stage for When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, the song he notoriously sang with former U.S. president Ronald Reagan at the 1985 “Shamrock Summit” in Quebec City, foreplay to the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

No one could have predicted that, within three years of that night, Mulroney would be back in the partisan spotlight with Donald Trump’s arrival to the U.S. presidency. A scrambling Liberal government led by the son of Mulroney’s Meech Lake nemesis, Pierre Trudeau, called on Mulroney for advice on how to handle Trump and renegotiate NAFTA. Later, Mulroney’s stirring eulogy for another U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, won plaudits and made Canadians proud.

It’s a measure of the political moment that the qualities Mulroney was pilloried for while in office—alliances with elites and American business, friendships with U.S. presidents, a gift for blarney—suddenly became national assets. Amid global volatility, an old-style Irish pol, a master of negotiating sometimes dodgy reciprocal relationships, offered comfort. In the process, the man once known as “Lyin’ Brian” is being recast as an elder statesman. It’s an unprecedented comeback, a reminder of how history hinges on which stories we tell or are told. With Mulroney, we’re watching reputation refurbishment in real time—awards, policy reassessment, the construction of the Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S.

It’s a focus that can’t help but cast light on conservative tradition in Canada. One odd twist to Mulroney’s return is how Liberals use his progressive environmental legislation to attack current Conservatives. Last December, Gerry Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, tweeted: “The Conservative party won’t have a plan for the environment. They haven’t had leadership that cares about it since Brian Mulroney. It’s not going to change in the Scheer/Ford/Kenney era.” Those with longer memories see the Mulroney legacy revamp as more complicated. Peter McInnis, associate professor and chair of history at StFX evokes another U.S. president: “I would describe it as the most ambitious effort for rehabilitation since Richard Nixon.”

In June 1993, Brian Mulroney made a safe, if wishful, prediction about “the beauty of historical judgment” to the Montreal Gazette: “It bears no relationship to today’s headlines.” He’d just resigned after almost nine years in office, months before a federal election, with the lowest polling approval rating ever of a Canadian PM. It was a stunning reversal for a politician who swept the Progressive Conservatives to a historic landslide majority in 1984, and a record second majority in 1988. Canadians, mired in recession, harboured a list of grievances: introduction of the GST and free trade; sending an ill-equipped Canadian military to fight in the Gulf War; a stream of scandals that saw 10 cabinet ministers resign. Mulroney was seen as too showy, too pro-business, too obsequious to power, not the way Canadians saw themselves. Mila Mulroney’s shopping habits won her the mocking nickname “Imelda” after Imelda Marcos. The Mulroneys’ taxpayer-funded global tour—London, Paris, Moscow—to bid farewell to world leaders summoned outrage. Two doomed constitutional initiatives—the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords—left the country divided and the Progressive Conservative party decimated. Lucien Bouchard defected to form the Bloc Québécois. The Kim Campbell-led Progressive Conservatives were crushed in the 1993 election, winning two seats; the party would only recover after a contentious 2003 merger created the Conservative Party of Canada.

The Mulroney years—the lobbyists, the conflicts of interest, the backroom deals, with cameos from arms dealers—were a goldmine for investigative journalists; Stevie Cameron’s 1994 On the Take and Marci McDonald’s 1995 Yankee Doodle Dandy were bestsellers. Historian Michael Bliss captured the sentiment in his 1995 book Right Honourable Men: The Descent of Canadian Politics from Macdonald to Mulroney: “Brian Mulroney knew how to lead elites—how to get premiers on side, business groups in his pocket and unity in his caucus, but when he urged Canadians to go over the top with him, they shot him in the back.”

That year, an aggrieved Mulroney filed an unprecedented $50-million lawsuit against the people he once represented after a Department of Justice letter to the Swiss government on behalf of the RCMP was leaked. It requested information related to allegations that Mulroney and others were involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud taxpayers involving the $1.8-billion purchase of 34 Airbus A320 passenger planes from a European consortium in 1988, with “improper commissions” allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber. “I never had any dealings with him,” Mulroney said under oath. He was awarded $2.1 million for legal and PR costs and the government was ordered to apologize in an out-of-court settlement.

Mulroney’s frustration over being underappreciated and misunderstood was writ large in Peter C. Newman’s 2005 book The Secret Mulroney Tapes, which captured him in unguarded moments: “You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none,” he is quoted as saying. A more modest, self-deprecating version of history appeared in Mulroney’s bestselling Memoirs, published in 2007. Its 1,100 pages included no mention of Schreiber, then suing Mulroney for the $300,000 he alleged he’d paid the politician for lobbying a German manufacturer of armoured vehicles—work he claimed Mulroney didn’t do.

In 2007, Stephen Harper ordered a public inquiry, which revealed that Mulroney not only knew Schreiber, who helped fund his leadership bid in 1983, but he accepted no less than $225,000 from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994. Justice Jeffrey Oliphant ruled in his 2010 report that Mulroney did not break any laws or use his influence while prime minister on the contract. Still, the takeaway imagery was tawdry: Mulroney met with Schreiber in three hotel rooms, one in New York City, and was handed envelopes filled with $1,000 bills. Oliphant’s report found “many inappropriate aspects,” including the lack of a paper trail, to deposit it in a bank or pay income tax on it until 2000. The judge also criticized Mulroney for a “heavy-handed” campaign to block a journalist’s story “to protect his reputation.”

Before the inquiry report was published, that reputation was declared irreparably damaged. “Regardless of what happens now, Brian Mulroney’s credibility and reputation is shattered,” the Tyee wrote in 2007.

But time passes, and people forget. Time provides hindsight and context, former prime minister Kim Campbell tells Maclean’s. She expresses no bitterness toward Mulroney for leaving her with an unwinnable election and a decimated party: “I don’t blame someone for being human,” she says. “People who make a mark are complicated,” Campbell says. “Brian Mulroney is complicated. He has great skills and annoying flaws.” Campbell was proud to serve in the Mulroney government, she says, where she held a number of cabinet portfolios; she was also the first woman appointed as Canada’s minister of justice and attorney general, where she oversaw key revisions to sexual assault legislation and advocated for more women in the judiciary.

Campbell cites one Mulroney flaw: his thin skin. He called her former chief of staff to complain about her 1996 political memoir, Time and Chance. She thought she’d treated him fairly: “People said, ‘Why were you so nice to Brian Mulroney?’ I said, ‘I just wrote it as I saw it.’ ” Mulroney was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, says Campbell, one of the women Mulroney appointed to powerful cabinet positions.

Reputations do not rely only on the sands of time. Money and powerful friends can also burnish the record. So can an able PR strategist. (In late 2007, Mulroney hired Robin Sears, a communications and policy consultant with Ottawa-based Earnscliffe Strategy Group.) In her 2012 book Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else, Chrystia Freeland, then a journalist, now minister of foreign affairs, wrote of politics as a path to big money: “One thing that isn’t in dispute is the material value of a political career after leaving office.” Few have been as successful as Mulroney, says Derek Burney, Mulroney’s former chief of staff and former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Retiring politicians of all stripes travel to Montreal for advice on post-political life, he says, as well as the hope of a few connections.

The powerful networks Mulroney assiduously cultivated before and during his stint in office were there for him afterwards. Mulroney “always noticed people worth noting,” says former Ontario Liberal premier David Peterson, who met Mulroney in Quebec in the ’60s. One of Mulroney’s great successes was identifying George H.W. Bush as the next president, says John Baird, a former minister of foreign affairs and the environment in the Harper government: “He advanced a very warm professional relationship before 1988.”

People who like Mulroney hold him in great, if not unflinching, affection. “I liked him even when I was mad at him,” says Peterson. “That doesn’t mean I love everything about him. But if I phone Brian Mulroney and say, ‘I need help,’ he’d be the first guy to line up.”

Mulroney sought common ground to both befriend and as a negotiating tool. Hugh Segal, a former senator who was Mulroney’s chief of staff, recalls asking Mulroney why he requested extensive intel on foreign leaders. “He said, ‘Huey, there’s not a single leader in the world—corporate or political—who wakes up in the morning, turns to his spouse and says: “I wonder how Canada is doing today?” Nobody cares about us. I have to look through that material to find linkages, so if I have to call the president of France or somebody in Africa because some Canadian is in prison, I have a relationship I can build on.’”

With his bountiful Rolodex, Mulroney nimbly forged connections between corporate shared interests. He sat on the international advisory board of Beijing-based China International Trust Investment Corp., a state-owned conglomerate that specializes in joint ventures with non-Chinese partners; later, he’d play matchmaker for a Barrick-Power joint venture to develop gold deposits in China.

Time found some Mulroney policies prescient. In 2006, he was hailed the “greenest” prime minister by the Canadian magazine Corporate Knights for the 1987 Montreal Protocol and the 1991 acid rain treaty. The 25th anniversary of the once-contentious free trade agreement brought more tributes. Ian MacDonald, Mulroney’s main speechwriter in the ’80s, later became the editor of Inside Policy magazine and devoted its first issue to a laudatory free-trade anniversary package. The University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs hosted a symposium.

Awards and tributes can be a way for the powerful to applaud one another. In 2012, Mulroney, Canada’s first working-class PM, received the Horatio Alger Award, named after the prolific 19th-century American dime-store novelist known for tales of young boys rising from poverty through hard work and honest living. (Other recipients include Ronald Reagan, Fred Trump, Maya Angelou and Leonardo DiCaprio.) Mulroney added “VP of the Horatio Alger Association of Canada” to his crammed CV in 2012. It provided an opportunity to talk publicly about scholarships for poor, worthy students—even if media wanted to revisit the past. In a 2015 Maclean’s interview, Mulroney deflected a question about the Oliphant inquiry, saying he’d not read the report. “I’ve been investigated more than any prime minister in Canadian history,” he said. “I have never been charged with a parking ticket.”

Mulroney’s gift for blarney also inspired devotion, and could even reshape reality. Jean Charest recalls attending caucus as an MP when the government was down in the polls: “We’d walk in at 15 per cent and we’d walk out, in our minds, at 80 per cent,” he told Maclean’s. “He was inspirational every single week.”

Campbell wonders if one of Mulroney’s perceived failings was appearing to “want it too much.” “He took great pleasure in becoming prime minister. He wasn’t Cincinnatus, who had to be persuaded away from his plough.” History can distort, she says: “People mythologize Pierre Trudeau as a reluctant PM. But, like Mulroney, he also wanted to be PM from an early age.”

Post-politics, Mulroney was never far from political action, helping with the Harper government transition and dispensing advice across the partisan spectrum, including advising former NDP leader Jack Layton on caucus management. “He never went away,” says Peterson. Harper told his cabinet to keep their distance from Mulroney after the Schreiber inquiry began. They didn’t. “It was one of the great secrets of the Harper era that as many as a dozen cabinet ministers would call Mr. Mulroney regularly to complain,” says a Mulroney friend. Mulroney offered advice and valuable contacts, reports Baird, who hosted a private reception for him in 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the acid rain treaty, attended by Bob Rae and Elizabeth May.

The shock of Trump made Mulroney newly relevant. “The government was scrambling like mad to find a point of traction with the new administration,” says Burney. Mulroney had known Trump for decades. They lunched occasionally in New York; he also often speaks with Jared Kushner, says Burney. His friend Wilbur Ross was named secretary of commerce. Schwarzman, of Blackstone, whose board he’d sat on since 2007, was named head of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

Initial talks between the government and Mulroney focused on the new U.S. government, says Burney (Mulroney declined Maclean’s interview request). He and Mulroney were invited to brief a cabinet committee on NAFTA; they brought together members of their original free-trade team to talk to Freeland, her chief negotiator and people from the PMO. “We each had several discussions with various players over the course of the negotiations,” he says. Mulroney’s message was consistent, Burney says: “Don’t pay attention to the bombast. Don’t play the Twitter game with the guy. Just stick to your guns and stare them down.” They shared their “No deal’s better than a bad deal” mantra from the first round. “I think they appreciated hearing it,” he says. “A lot of members of the cabinet were not even born when the free-trade agreement was concluded.”

Mulroney provided the public image of a steady hand at the tiller. “There’s movement going on between Canada and the United States at the moment, led by the Prime Minister, and I think it’s all positive,” he told CBC’s Power & Politics in December 2016. He also flattered Trump, calling him “a very solid citizen.” U.S.-Canada trade is “a perfect model,” he said. “They have no problems with us. I think they’re talking mostly about Mexico”—a comment soon seen to have no grounding in reality.

Mulroney also arranged for Schwarzman, nicknamed “Trump’s China whisperer” for his contacts with that country, to speak at the Liberal caucus retreat in Calgary in January 2017. (Blackstone’s first executive hire in Canada in 2014 was Mulroney’s son-in-law, Andrew Lapham.) In what would be a case of universes colliding, Freeland also met with Schwarzman and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser who sits on Barrick’s international advisory board with Mulroney. As a journalist, Freeland interviewed Schwarzman for Plutocrats, which described his ostentatious 60th birthday party in 2007, just before a market meltdown.

In March 2017, the Mulroneys dined with Trump and his wife, Melania, at a cancer research fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago; Mulroney reprised history, singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling for another president.

When the NAFTA deal appeared in peril in September, Mulroney fielded media questions. “Have we missed a chance? You never do in life,” he said. “There’s always another chance.” Weeks later, the deal was signed. It was a big win for Canada, and for Mulroney, says Baird: “All the wins we got in this renegotiation were keeping things he had successfully fought for in the original trade deal.” Baird sees the Liberal validation of Mulroney’s record as a vindication: “[Margaret] Thatcher was once asked what her greatest accomplishment was,” Baird says. “Her response was ‘Tony Blair.’ And in many ways, one of Mr. Mulroney’s greatest accomplishments was to get the Liberal government to be such a champion of free trade.”

Mulroney was not paid for his advisory role, says a PMO spokesperson. Asked if there was any discussion or screening of potential conflict of interest given Mulroney’s directorships with companies that could be affected by the treaty, the PMO declined to answer. (Liberal legislation did pave the way for another Mulroney board seat—announced on Oct. 17, 2018, the day cannabis was legalized—with New York City-based cannabis company Acreage Holdings.)

Post-politics, foreign governments honoured Mulroney, who was handed the highest civilian awards from Ukraine, Japan, South Africa and France. His return to the public eye in 2016 provided a moment to highlight his accomplishments on the world stage, says Fen Hampson, professor of international affairs at Carleton University, and author of Master of Persuasion: Brian Mulroney’s Global Legacy, published in 2018. Hampson, who has co-authored op-eds and a 2014 book with Burney, saw a void, he tells Maclean’s: “We remember Mulroney for, shall we say, his indiscretions. But that’s overshadowed by a much more substantiative policy legacy that requires sober second analysis.” The glowing foreword, by former U.S. secretary of state James A. Baker III, sets the tone: “Under Brian Mulroney’s leadership Canada punched well above its weight on the world’s stage.” Hampson writes of Mulroney’s “moral crusade for justice,” highlighting his advocacy to end apartheid in South Africa, which saw him spar with Thatcher, and also giving Canada a respected voice at the G7. “He operated on the theory that ‘I’m not dealing with what’s going to be popular today, I’m doing things that are going to be good for the country in 10 years’ time,’ ” says Hampson, who notes Mulroney sat with him for interviews.

Last year, Mulroney received yet another honour: entry into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame for his “extraordinary contribution to enriching the quality of life for Canadians with physical disabilities.” As PM, Mulroney instructed his finance minister to provide something in the budget for Canadians with disabilities, Burney says, noting Mulroney had three cousins with disabilities; he presents a heroic picture of a young Mulroney carrying them to the shrine of Baie-Comeau’s Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in search of a miracle.

Another church, the Washington National Cathedral, would provide a defining Mulroney moment as he represented Canada at the funeral of George H.W. Bush with cabinet minister Scott Brison and U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton. With Trump in the first row, Mulroney employed strategic hyperbole to celebrate the U.S. (“in my judgment, the greatest democratic republic that God has ever placed on the face of this Earth”) and Bush Sr. (“no occupant of the Oval Office was more courageous, more principled and more honourable”). He emphasized their shared legislative legacy—the Clean Air Act that resulted in the acid rain treaty was “a splendid gift to future generations of Americans and Canadians”; NAFTA was “recently modernized and improved by new administrations,” which “created the largest and richest free-trade area in the history of the world.” Bush’s first Gulf War “will rank with the most spectacular and successful international initiatives ever undertaken in modern history,” he said, as sanitized a view of that conflict as could be imagined. Mulroney ended with an Irish proverb: There are wooden ships / There are sailing ships / There are ships that sail the sea / But the best ships are friendships / And may they always be. It was cringingly sentimental. It was also pitch-perfect amid unprecedented political polarity.

The Mulroney Institute of Government, set to open officially this year at StFX, has been in the works for more than a decade. The institute is the closest Canada has come to erecting a U.S.-style presidential library; Mulroney has called the school, which will offer an undergraduate degree in public policy, a “mini version” of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former British prime minister Tony Blair will lecture, he promised.

Cladding on the site featured photos of Mulroney with Reagan and Thatcher, and with Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela. Mulroney Hall will house academic and research labs and offices as well as Mulroney memorabilia, including selected correspondence and a replica of his office as PM. Fundraising began in 2012, with Mulroney collecting close to $60 million himself (he has close ties to StFX, having graduated with a political science B.A. in 1959). His friends were generous, among them Koch, Ross, Gerald Schwartz, Weston, Ron Joyce, Paul Desmarais and Segal. Mulroney personally contributed $1 million. Nova Scotia gave $5 million. In April 2017, the federal government announced $30 million in funding for three campus projects, including the institute. Harper was urged to pony up by members of his cabinet, but did not.

The legacy project again put investigative journalists to work—and created the headlines associated with Mulroney: proximity to unseemly activities, but no conviction. An international consortium of journalists who looked into donors found two with links to arms sales and tax havens. Victor Dahdaleh, a British-Canadian businessman, and Wafic Saïd, who contributed a combined $5.5 million, both received honorary doctorates from StFX in 2015, though neither attended the university nor has connection to the province. Mulroney sat on the board of the Bermuda-based Said Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2012, according to the Paradise Papers. (In an email, StFX president Kent MacDonald writes that protocols for giving honorary degrees were followed and both men have histories of donating to education internationally.)

The influx of cash has been transformative on campus, says history professor McInnis. Still, he expresses concern about the sources of some funding, noting commerce secretary Ross’s ties to Russia. How much control donors will have of the curriculum is unclear, he says. “Obviously donors get a say to a certain point. But if it crosses the line into infringing on academic freedom, that’s a concern.” Koch runs the Koch Foundation, whose donations were found to come with a say in the hiring and firing of professors at Virginia’s George Mason University.

McInnis sees burnishing of not only Mulroney’s reputation but of the Conservative party more generally, pointing to controversy on campus concerning Mulroney receiving the former desk of John A. Macdonald as a parting gift to the PC party in 1993. Macdonald’s role as a leading Conservative and the architect of residential schools is problematic, he says, given the pressure on the university under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with Indigenous issues. (The Mulroney Institute will fund a $1-million bursary for Indigenous students.)

Burney refers to Mulroney as “the patriarch of the Conservative party,” even though the party he led no longer exists. “The PC party was a big-tent party that encompassed a lot of different people—Red Tories and social conservatives—and we all had to work together,” says Campbell. “That made it a challenge to lead. It also meant it was a pretty centrist political institution.” Campbell couldn’t survive in today’s Conservative party, she says: “It’s too intolerant; it’s too right-wing.”

In recent interviews, Mulroney too has drawn a line, emphasizing his government’s record of increasing the flow of immigrants and refugees into the country. He told Power & Politics of his “firm belief that Canada and other democracies only prosper with great waves of immigration . . . Anything that varies from what I just said should be unacceptable.”

Mulroney’s association with the current Conservatives is complex. He avidly supported his daughter Caroline Mulroney’s run for leadership of the Ontario Conservatives—and the creation of a possible Mulroney political dynasty. In Patrick Brown’s 2018 book Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown, the deposed Ontario Conservative leader reveals that Mulroney promised Brown a place “at the centre” of his daughter’s government if he swung his organizational clout to her campaign for leader—and then for premier. Brown didn’t. Caroline Mulroney, a political neophyte, lost the leadership race but won a seat and was named attorney general in the Doug Ford government.

Tensions are also said to exist between Andrew Scheer’s team and Mulroney. Scheer spokesperson Daniel Schow is vague when asked about the relationship: “They’ve spoken. They have friends in common. They’re both Conservative politicians.” Mulroney will be diplomatically quiet during the federal election, his spokesperson Sears predicts: “No one expects him to be completely silent. But I think he’ll be more circumspect and less frequent.” Speaking up is a delicate matter, given his daughter’s place in the Ford government. “He is used as a club to beat her with by the Liberals and New Dems,” Sears says. (Friends say Mulroney is not happy about Butt’s tweets that criticize his daughter’s rejection of a carbon tax.) Sears laments Canada’s treatment of retired politicians: “I find it so distressing that when we have a former leader pass from the stage we put them on the iceberg and let them float gently out to sea.” In a conversation held before Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum’s exit, Sears proposes that Mulroney’s skill set could be useful in the current standoff with China. “[Jean] Chrétien and Brian have forgotten more about Canada-China relations than these kids would know in the next 10 years,” he says. “Why not call either of them to make a discreet visit to Beijing to express our sympathies for the unhappiness this situation has caused the both of us and say, ‘Are there any messages you want to convey privately?’ ” Using former U.S. presidents to broker such matters is a time-honoured American trick. It’s telling of the political moment, and of Mulroney’s reputational rehab, that it’s an idea not unworthy of consideration.

Allies from his political days, including former Mulroney government cabinet minister and Quebec premier Jean Charest, mingled with newer friends like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. The Palm Beach Daily News counted “so many more richy-richies that if the ground had opened up beneath the building, Congress would have to rewrite the tax code.”\n\nAt the epicentre was Brian Mulroney, Canada’s 18th prime minister, regaling the crowd with a tale about announcing a political return to his wife: “I had been out of politics for some time, but I was really unhappy with some things that were going on in Canada,” he said. “So I sat her down and said, ‘Mila, I’m considering running for office again. How do you feel about that?’ And she answered, ‘Honey, I want you to do whatever makes you happy. And I’m sure your new wife will feel the same way.’ ”\n\nThe punchline drew riotous laughter. Even funnier was the notion that Mulroney would consider a return to politics given the circumstances around his departure—and the wealth and influence he’d amassed since leaving office three decades earlier: he was senior partner in the Montreal office of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright; he sat on the boards of Archer Daniels Midland, Barrick Gold Corp., Power Corp., Blackstone and Quebecor Inc., among many others; he pulled in more than $1 million a year on the speakers circuit; he and Mila had lived comfortably part of the year among the Palm Beach rich since they bought a house there in 1997.\n\nStill, Mulroney couldn’t resist sparking political nostalgia as he joined the Canadian Tenors on stage for When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, the song he notoriously sang with former U.S. president Ronald Reagan at the 1985 “Shamrock Summit” in Quebec City, foreplay to the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.\n\nNo one could have predicted that, within three years of that night, Mulroney would be back in the partisan spotlight with Donald Trump’s arrival to the U.S. presidency. A scrambling Liberal government led by the son of Mulroney’s Meech Lake nemesis, Pierre Trudeau, called on Mulroney for advice on how to handle Trump and renegotiate NAFTA. Later, Mulroney’s stirring eulogy for another U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, won plaudits and made Canadians proud.\n\nIt’s a measure of the political moment that the qualities Mulroney was pilloried for while in office—alliances with elites and American business, friendships with U.S. presidents, a gift for blarney—suddenly became national assets. Amid global volatility, an old-style Irish pol, a master of negotiating sometimes dodgy reciprocal relationships, offered comfort. In the process, the man once known as “Lyin’ Brian” is being recast as an elder statesman. It’s an unprecedented comeback, a reminder of how history hinges on which stories we tell or are told. With Mulroney, we’re watching reputation refurbishment in real time—awards, policy reassessment, the construction of the Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S.\n\nIt’s a focus that can’t help but cast light on conservative tradition in Canada. One odd twist to Mulroney’s return is how Liberals use his progressive environmental legislation to attack current Conservatives. Last December, Gerry Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, tweeted: “The Conservative party won’t have a plan for the environment. They haven’t had leadership that cares about it since Brian Mulroney. It’s not going to change in the Scheer/Ford/Kenney era.” Those with longer memories see the Mulroney legacy revamp as more complicated. Peter McInnis, associate professor and chair of history at StFX evokes another U.S. president: “I would describe it as the most ambitious effort for rehabilitation since Richard Nixon.”\n\nIn June 1993, Brian Mulroney made a safe, if wishful, prediction about “the beauty of historical judgment” to the Montreal Gazette: “It bears no relationship to today’s headlines.” He’d just resigned after almost nine years in office, months before a federal election, with the lowest polling approval rating ever of a Canadian PM. It was a stunning reversal for a politician who swept the Progressive Conservatives to a historic landslide majority in 1984, and a record second majority in 1988. Canadians, mired in recession, harboured a list of grievances: introduction of the GST and free trade; sending an ill-equipped Canadian military to fight in the Gulf War; a stream of scandals that saw 10 cabinet ministers resign. Mulroney was seen as too showy, too pro-business, too obsequious to power, not the way Canadians saw themselves. Mila Mulroney’s shopping habits won her the mocking nickname “Imelda” after Imelda Marcos. The Mulroneys’ taxpayer-funded global tour—London, Paris, Moscow—to bid farewell to world leaders summoned outrage. Two doomed constitutional initiatives—the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords—left the country divided and the Progressive Conservative party decimated. Lucien Bouchard defected to form the Bloc Québécois. The Kim Campbell-led Progressive Conservatives were crushed in the 1993 election, winning two seats; the party would only recover after a contentious 2003 merger created the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nThe Mulroney years—the lobbyists, the conflicts of interest, the backroom deals, with cameos from arms dealers—were a goldmine for investigative journalists; Stevie Cameron’s 1994 On the Take and Marci McDonald’s 1995 Yankee Doodle Dandy were bestsellers. Historian Michael Bliss captured the sentiment in his 1995 book Right Honourable Men: The Descent of Canadian Politics from Macdonald to Mulroney: “Brian Mulroney knew how to lead elites—how to get premiers on side, business groups in his pocket and unity in his caucus, but when he urged Canadians to go over the top with him, they shot him in the back.”\n\nThat year, an aggrieved Mulroney filed an unprecedented $50-million lawsuit against the people he once represented after a Department of Justice letter to the Swiss government on behalf of the RCMP was leaked. It requested information related to allegations that Mulroney and others were involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud taxpayers involving the $1.8-billion purchase of 34 Airbus A320 passenger planes from a European consortium in 1988, with “improper commissions” allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber. “I never had any dealings with him,” Mulroney said under oath. He was awarded $2.1 million for legal and PR costs and the government was ordered to apologize in an out-of-court settlement.\n\nMulroney’s frustration over being underappreciated and misunderstood was writ large in Peter C. Newman’s 2005 book The Secret Mulroney Tapes, which captured him in unguarded moments: “You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none,” he is quoted as saying. A more modest, self-deprecating version of history appeared in Mulroney’s bestselling Memoirs, published in 2007. Its 1,100 pages included no mention of Schreiber, then suing Mulroney for the $300,000 he alleged he’d paid the politician for lobbying a German manufacturer of armoured vehicles—work he claimed Mulroney didn’t do.\n\nIn 2007, Stephen Harper ordered a public inquiry, which revealed that Mulroney not only knew Schreiber, who helped fund his leadership bid in 1983, but he accepted no less than $225,000 from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994. Justice Jeffrey Oliphant ruled in his 2010 report that Mulroney did not break any laws or use his influence while prime minister on the contract. Still, the takeaway imagery was tawdry: Mulroney met with Schreiber in three hotel rooms, one in New York City, and was handed envelopes filled with $1,000 bills. Oliphant’s report found “many inappropriate aspects,” including the lack of a paper trail, to deposit it in a bank or pay income tax on it until 2000. The judge also criticized Mulroney for a “heavy-handed” campaign to block a journalist’s story “to protect his reputation.”\n\nBefore the inquiry report was published, that reputation was declared irreparably damaged. “Regardless of what happens now, Brian Mulroney’s credibility and reputation is shattered,” the Tyee wrote in 2007.\n\nBut time passes, and people forget. Time provides hindsight and context, former prime minister Kim Campbell tells Maclean’s. She expresses no bitterness toward Mulroney for leaving her with an unwinnable election and a decimated party: “I don’t blame someone for being human,” she says. “People who make a mark are complicated,” Campbell says. “Brian Mulroney is complicated. He has great skills and annoying flaws.” Campbell was proud to serve in the Mulroney government, she says, where she held a number of cabinet portfolios; she was also the first woman appointed as Canada’s minister of justice and attorney general, where she oversaw key revisions to sexual assault legislation and advocated for more women in the judiciary.\n\nCampbell cites one Mulroney flaw: his thin skin. He called her former chief of staff to complain about her 1996 political memoir, Time and Chance. She thought she’d treated him fairly: “People said, ‘Why were you so nice to Brian Mulroney?’ I said, ‘I just wrote it as I saw it.’ ” Mulroney was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, says Campbell, one of the women Mulroney appointed to powerful cabinet positions.\n\nReputations do not rely only on the sands of time. Money and powerful friends can also burnish the record. So can an able PR strategist. (In late 2007, Mulroney hired Robin Sears, a communications and policy consultant with Ottawa-based Earnscliffe Strategy Group.) In her 2012 book Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else, Chrystia Freeland, then a journalist, now minister of foreign affairs, wrote of politics as a path to big money: “One thing that isn’t in dispute is the material value of a political career after leaving office.” Few have been as successful as Mulroney, says Derek Burney, Mulroney’s former chief of staff and former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Retiring politicians of all stripes travel to Montreal for advice on post-political life, he says, as well as the hope of a few connections.\n\nThe powerful networks Mulroney assiduously cultivated before and during his stint in office were there for him afterwards. Mulroney “always noticed people worth noting,” says former Ontario Liberal premier David Peterson, who met Mulroney in Quebec in the ’60s. One of Mulroney’s great successes was identifying George H.W. Bush as the next president, says John Baird, a former minister of foreign affairs and the environment in the Harper government: “He advanced a very warm professional relationship before 1988.”\n\nPeople who like Mulroney hold him in great, if not unflinching, affection. “I liked him even when I was mad at him,” says Peterson. “That doesn’t mean I love everything about him. But if I phone Brian Mulroney and say, ‘I need help,’ he’d be the first guy to line up.”\n\nMulroney sought common ground to both befriend and as a negotiating tool. Hugh Segal, a former senator who was Mulroney’s chief of staff, recalls asking Mulroney why he requested extensive intel on foreign leaders. “He said, ‘Huey, there’s not a single leader in the world—corporate or political—who wakes up in the morning, turns to his spouse and says: “I wonder how Canada is doing today?” Nobody cares about us. I have to look through that material to find linkages, so if I have to call the president of France or somebody in Africa because some Canadian is in prison, I have a relationship I can build on.’”\n\nWith his bountiful Rolodex, Mulroney nimbly forged connections between corporate shared interests. He sat on the international advisory board of Beijing-based China International Trust Investment Corp., a state-owned conglomerate that specializes in joint ventures with non-Chinese partners; later, he’d play matchmaker for a Barrick-Power joint venture to develop gold deposits in China.\n\nTime found some Mulroney policies prescient. In 2006, he was hailed the “greenest” prime minister by the Canadian magazine Corporate Knights for the 1987 Montreal Protocol and the 1991 acid rain treaty. The 25th anniversary of the once-contentious free trade agreement brought more tributes. Ian MacDonald, Mulroney’s main speechwriter in the ’80s, later became the editor of Inside Policy magazine and devoted its first issue to a laudatory free-trade anniversary package. The University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs hosted a symposium.\n\nAwards and tributes can be a way for the powerful to applaud one another. In 2012, Mulroney, Canada’s first working-class PM, received the Horatio Alger Award, named after the prolific 19th-century American dime-store novelist known for tales of young boys rising from poverty through hard work and honest living. (Other recipients include Ronald Reagan, Fred Trump, Maya Angelou and Leonardo DiCaprio.) Mulroney added “VP of the Horatio Alger Association of Canada” to his crammed CV in 2012. It provided an opportunity to talk publicly about scholarships for poor, worthy students—even if media wanted to revisit the past. In a 2015 Maclean’s interview, Mulroney deflected a question about the Oliphant inquiry, saying he’d not read the report. “I’ve been investigated more than any prime minister in Canadian history,” he said. “I have never been charged with a parking ticket.”\n\nMulroney’s gift for blarney also inspired devotion, and could even reshape reality. Jean Charest recalls attending caucus as an MP when the government was down in the polls: “We’d walk in at 15 per cent and we’d walk out, in our minds, at 80 per cent,” he told Maclean’s. “He was inspirational every single week.”\n\nCampbell wonders if one of Mulroney’s perceived failings was appearing to “want it too much.” “He took great pleasure in becoming prime minister. He wasn’t Cincinnatus, who had to be persuaded away from his plough.” History can distort, she says: “People mythologize Pierre Trudeau as a reluctant PM. But, like Mulroney, he also wanted to be PM from an early age.”\n\nPost-politics, Mulroney was never far from political action, helping with the Harper government transition and dispensing advice across the partisan spectrum, including advising former NDP leader Jack Layton on caucus management. “He never went away,” says Peterson. Harper told his cabinet to keep their distance from Mulroney after the Schreiber inquiry began. They didn’t. “It was one of the great secrets of the Harper era that as many as a dozen cabinet ministers would call Mr. Mulroney regularly to complain,” says a Mulroney friend. Mulroney offered advice and valuable contacts, reports Baird, who hosted a private reception for him in 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the acid rain treaty, attended by Bob Rae and Elizabeth May.\n\nThe shock of Trump made Mulroney newly relevant. “The government was scrambling like mad to find a point of traction with the new administration,” says Burney. Mulroney had known Trump for decades. They lunched occasionally in New York; he also often speaks with Jared Kushner, says Burney. His friend Wilbur Ross was named secretary of commerce. Schwarzman, of Blackstone, whose board he’d sat on since 2007, was named head of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum.\n\nInitial talks between the government and Mulroney focused on the new U.S. government, says Burney (Mulroney declined Maclean’s interview request). He and Mulroney were invited to brief a cabinet committee on NAFTA; they brought together members of their original free-trade team to talk to Freeland, her chief negotiator and people from the PMO. “We each had several discussions with various players over the course of the negotiations,” he says. Mulroney’s message was consistent, Burney says: “Don’t pay attention to the bombast. Don’t play the Twitter game with the guy. Just stick to your guns and stare them down.” They shared their “No deal’s better than a bad deal” mantra from the first round. “I think they appreciated hearing it,” he says. “A lot of members of the cabinet were not even born when the free-trade agreement was concluded.”\n\nMulroney provided the public image of a steady hand at the tiller. “There’s movement going on between Canada and the United States at the moment, led by the Prime Minister, and I think it’s all positive,” he told CBC’s Power & Politics in December 2016. He also flattered Trump, calling him “a very solid citizen.” U.S.-Canada trade is “a perfect model,” he said. “They have no problems with us. I think they’re talking mostly about Mexico”—a comment soon seen to have no grounding in reality.\n\nMulroney also arranged for Schwarzman, nicknamed “Trump’s China whisperer” for his contacts with that country, to speak at the Liberal caucus retreat in Calgary in January 2017. (Blackstone’s first executive hire in Canada in 2014 was Mulroney’s son-in-law, Andrew Lapham.) In what would be a case of universes colliding, Freeland also met with Schwarzman and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser who sits on Barrick’s international advisory board with Mulroney. As a journalist, Freeland interviewed Schwarzman for Plutocrats, which described his ostentatious 60th birthday party in 2007, just before a market meltdown.\n\nIn March 2017, the Mulroneys dined with Trump and his wife, Melania, at a cancer research fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago; Mulroney reprised history, singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling for another president.\n\nWhen the NAFTA deal appeared in peril in September, Mulroney fielded media questions. “Have we missed a chance? You never do in life,” he said. “There’s always another chance.” Weeks later, the deal was signed. It was a big win for Canada, and for Mulroney, says Baird: “All the wins we got in this renegotiation were keeping things he had successfully fought for in the original trade deal.” Baird sees the Liberal validation of Mulroney’s record as a vindication: “[Margaret] Thatcher was once asked what her greatest accomplishment was,” Baird says. “Her response was ‘Tony Blair.’ And in many ways, one of Mr. Mulroney’s greatest accomplishments was to get the Liberal government to be such a champion of free trade.”\n\nMulroney was not paid for his advisory role, says a PMO spokesperson. Asked if there was any discussion or screening of potential conflict of interest given Mulroney’s directorships with companies that could be affected by the treaty, the PMO declined to answer. (Liberal legislation did pave the way for another Mulroney board seat—announced on Oct. 17, 2018, the day cannabis was legalized—with New York City-based cannabis company Acreage Holdings.)\n\nPost-politics, foreign governments honoured Mulroney, who was handed the highest civilian awards from Ukraine, Japan, South Africa and France. His return to the public eye in 2016 provided a moment to highlight his accomplishments on the world stage, says Fen Hampson, professor of international affairs at Carleton University, and author of Master of Persuasion: Brian Mulroney’s Global Legacy, published in 2018. Hampson, who has co-authored op-eds and a 2014 book with Burney, saw a void, he tells Maclean’s: “We remember Mulroney for, shall we say, his indiscretions. But that’s overshadowed by a much more substantiative policy legacy that requires sober second analysis.” The glowing foreword, by former U.S. secretary of state James A. Baker III, sets the tone: “Under Brian Mulroney’s leadership Canada punched well above its weight on the world’s stage.” Hampson writes of Mulroney’s “moral crusade for justice,” highlighting his advocacy to end apartheid in South Africa, which saw him spar with Thatcher, and also giving Canada a respected voice at the G7. “He operated on the theory that ‘I’m not dealing with what’s going to be popular today, I’m doing things that are going to be good for the country in 10 years’ time,’ ” says Hampson, who notes Mulroney sat with him for interviews.\n\nLast year, Mulroney received yet another honour: entry into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame for his “extraordinary contribution to enriching the quality of life for Canadians with physical disabilities.” As PM, Mulroney instructed his finance minister to provide something in the budget for Canadians with disabilities, Burney says, noting Mulroney had three cousins with disabilities; he presents a heroic picture of a young Mulroney carrying them to the shrine of Baie-Comeau’s Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in search of a miracle.\n\nAnother church, the Washington National Cathedral, would provide a defining Mulroney moment as he represented Canada at the funeral of George H.W. Bush with cabinet minister Scott Brison and U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton. With Trump in the first row, Mulroney employed strategic hyperbole to celebrate the U.S. (“in my judgment, the greatest democratic republic that God has ever placed on the face of this Earth”) and Bush Sr. (“no occupant of the Oval Office was more courageous, more principled and more honourable”). He emphasized their shared legislative legacy—the Clean Air Act that resulted in the acid rain treaty was “a splendid gift to future generations of Americans and Canadians”; NAFTA was “recently modernized and improved by new administrations,” which “created the largest and richest free-trade area in the history of the world.” Bush’s first Gulf War “will rank with the most spectacular and successful international initiatives ever undertaken in modern history,” he said, as sanitized a view of that conflict as could be imagined. Mulroney ended with an Irish proverb: There are wooden ships / There are sailing ships / There are ships that sail the sea / But the best ships are friendships / And may they always be. It was cringingly sentimental. It was also pitch-perfect amid unprecedented political polarity.\n\nThe Mulroney Institute of Government, set to open officially this year at StFX, has been in the works for more than a decade. The institute is the closest Canada has come to erecting a U.S.-style presidential library; Mulroney has called the school, which will offer an undergraduate degree in public policy, a “mini version” of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former British prime minister Tony Blair will lecture, he promised.\n\nCladding on the site featured photos of Mulroney with Reagan and Thatcher, and with Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela. Mulroney Hall will house academic and research labs and offices as well as Mulroney memorabilia, including selected correspondence and a replica of his office as PM. Fundraising began in 2012, with Mulroney collecting close to $60 million himself (he has close ties to StFX, having graduated with a political science B.A. in 1959). His friends were generous, among them Koch, Ross, Gerald Schwartz, Weston, Ron Joyce, Paul Desmarais and Segal. Mulroney personally contributed $1 million. Nova Scotia gave $5 million. In April 2017, the federal government announced $30 million in funding for three campus projects, including the institute. Harper was urged to pony up by members of his cabinet, but did not.\n\nThe legacy project again put investigative journalists to work—and created the headlines associated with Mulroney: proximity to unseemly activities, but no conviction. An international consortium of journalists who looked into donors found two with links to arms sales and tax havens. Victor Dahdaleh, a British-Canadian businessman, and Wafic Saïd, who contributed a combined $5.5 million, both received honorary doctorates from StFX in 2015, though neither attended the university nor has connection to the province. Mulroney sat on the board of the Bermuda-based Said Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2012, according to the Paradise Papers. (In an email, StFX president Kent MacDonald writes that protocols for giving honorary degrees were followed and both men have histories of donating to education internationally.)\n\nThe influx of cash has been transformative on campus, says history professor McInnis. Still, he expresses concern about the sources of some funding, noting commerce secretary Ross’s ties to Russia. How much control donors will have of the curriculum is unclear, he says. “Obviously donors get a say to a certain point. But if it crosses the line into infringing on academic freedom, that’s a concern.” Koch runs the Koch Foundation, whose donations were found to come with a say in the hiring and firing of professors at Virginia’s George Mason University.\n\nMcInnis sees burnishing of not only Mulroney’s reputation but of the Conservative party more generally, pointing to controversy on campus concerning Mulroney receiving the former desk of John A. Macdonald as a parting gift to the PC party in 1993. Macdonald’s role as a leading Conservative and the architect of residential schools is problematic, he says, given the pressure on the university under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with Indigenous issues. (The Mulroney Institute will fund a $1-million bursary for Indigenous students.)\n\nBurney refers to Mulroney as “the patriarch of the Conservative party,” even though the party he led no longer exists. “The PC party was a big-tent party that encompassed a lot of different people—Red Tories and social conservatives—and we all had to work together,” says Campbell. “That made it a challenge to lead. It also meant it was a pretty centrist political institution.” Campbell couldn’t survive in today’s Conservative party, she says: “It’s too intolerant; it’s too right-wing.”\n\nIn recent interviews, Mulroney too has drawn a line, emphasizing his government’s record of increasing the flow of immigrants and refugees into the country. He told Power & Politics of his “firm belief that Canada and other democracies only prosper with great waves of immigration . . . Anything that varies from what I just said should be unacceptable.”\n\nMulroney’s association with the current Conservatives is complex. He avidly supported his daughter Caroline Mulroney’s run for leadership of the Ontario Conservatives—and the creation of a possible Mulroney political dynasty. In Patrick Brown’s 2018 book Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown, the deposed Ontario Conservative leader reveals that Mulroney promised Brown a place “at the centre” of his daughter’s government if he swung his organizational clout to her campaign for leader—and then for premier. Brown didn’t. Caroline Mulroney, a political neophyte, lost the leadership race but won a seat and was named attorney general in the Doug Ford government.\n\nTensions are also said to exist between Andrew Scheer’s team and Mulroney. Scheer spokesperson Daniel Schow is vague when asked about the relationship: “They’ve spoken. They have friends in common. They’re both Conservative politicians.” Mulroney will be diplomatically quiet during the federal election, his spokesperson Sears predicts: “No one expects him to be completely silent. But I think he’ll be more circumspect and less frequent.” Speaking up is a delicate matter, given his daughter’s place in the Ford government. “He is used as a club to beat her with by the Liberals and New Dems,” Sears says. (Friends say Mulroney is not happy about Butt’s tweets that criticize his daughter’s rejection of a carbon tax.) Sears laments Canada’s treatment of retired politicians: “I find it so distressing that when we have a former leader pass from the stage we put them on the iceberg and let them float gently out to sea.” In a conversation held before Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum’s exit, Sears proposes that Mulroney’s skill set could be useful in the current standoff with China. “[Jean] Chrétien and Brian have forgotten more about Canada-China relations than these kids would know in the next 10 years,” he says. “Why not call either of them to make a discreet visit to Beijing to express our sympathies for the unhappiness this situation has caused the both of us and say, ‘Are there any messages you want to convey privately?’ ” Using former U.S. presidents to broker such matters is a time-honoured American trick. It’s telling of the political moment, and of Mulroney’s reputational rehab, that it’s an idea not unworthy of consideration.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story inaccurately stated that the John A.

(Jacquelyn Martin/CP)</p></div>\n<p>In March 2014, Mila Mulroney threw a surprise 75th birthday party for her husband at Palm Beach’s private Club Colette, a glitzy event that garnered gush from American gossip columns. “Billionaires party with former Canadian prime minister,” <em>New York Post</em>’s Page Six announced, listing some of the Canadian and U.S. one-percenters present: oil baron and Tea Party funder David Koch; Seagram scion Charles Bronfman; investor Wilbur Ross; Galen Weston, executive chairman of George Weston Ltd.; and Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of New York-based Blackstone Group, the world’s largest private equity firm. Allies from his political days, including former Mulroney government cabinet minister and Quebec premier Jean Charest, mingled with newer friends like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. The <em>Palm Beach Daily News </em>counted “so many more richy-richies that if the ground had opened up beneath the building, Congress would have to rewrite the tax code.”</p>\n<p>At the epicentre was Brian Mulroney, Canada’s 18th prime minister, regaling the crowd with a tale about announcing a political return to his wife: “I had been out of politics for some time, but I was really unhappy with some things that were going on in Canada,” he said. “So I sat her down and said, ‘Mila, I’m considering running for office again. How do you feel about that?’ And she answered, ‘Honey, I want you to do whatever makes you happy. And I’m sure your new wife will feel the same way.’\u2009”</p>\n<p>The punchline drew riotous laughter. Even funnier was the notion that Mulroney would consider a return to politics given the circumstances around his departure—and the wealth and influence he’d amassed since leaving office three decades earlier: he was senior partner in the Montreal office of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright; he sat on the boards of Archer Daniels Midland, Barrick Gold Corp., Power Corp., Blackstone and Quebecor Inc., among many others; he pulled in more than $1 million a year on the speakers circuit; he and Mila had lived comfortably part of the year among the Palm Beach rich since they bought a house there in 1997.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/hes-back-2/"">Brian Mulroney is back</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Still, Mulroney couldn’t resist sparking political nostalgia as he joined the Canadian Tenors on stage for When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, the song he notoriously sang with former U.S. president Ronald Reagan at the 1985 “Shamrock Summit” in Quebec City, foreplay to the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.</p>\n<p>No one could have predicted that, within three years of that night, Mulroney would be back in the partisan spotlight with Donald Trump’s arrival to the U.S. presidency. A scrambling Liberal government led by the son of Mulroney’s Meech Lake nemesis, Pierre Trudeau, called on Mulroney for advice on how to handle Trump and renegotiate NAFTA. Later, Mulroney’s stirring eulogy for another U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, won plaudits and made Canadians proud.</p>\n<p>It’s a measure of the political moment that the qualities Mulroney was pilloried for while in office—alliances with elites and American business, friendships with U.S. presidents, a gift for blarney—suddenly became national assets. Amid global volatility, an old-style Irish pol, a master of negotiating sometimes dodgy reciprocal relationships, offered comfort. In the process, the man once known as “Lyin’ Brian” is being recast as an elder statesman. It’s an unprecedented comeback, a reminder of how history hinges on which stories we tell or are told. With Mulroney, we’re watching reputation refurbishment in real time—awards, policy reassessment, the construction of the Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S.</p>\n<p>It’s a focus that can’t help but cast light on conservative tradition in Canada. One odd twist to Mulroney’s return is how Liberals use his progressive environmental legislation to attack current Conservatives. Last December, Gerry Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, tweeted: “The Conservative party won’t have a plan for the environment. They haven’t had leadership that cares about it since Brian Mulroney. It’s not going to change in the Scheer/Ford/Kenney era.” Those with longer memories see the Mulroney legacy revamp as more complicated. Peter McInnis, associate professor and chair of history at StFX evokes another U.S. president: “I would describe it as the most ambitious effort for rehabilitation since Richard Nixon.”</p>\n<p>In June 1993, Brian Mulroney made a safe, if wishful, prediction about “the beauty of historical judgment” to the <em>Montreal Gazette</em>: “It bears no relationship to today’s headlines.” He’d just resigned after almost nine years in office, months before a federal election, with the lowest polling approval rating ever of a Canadian PM. It was a stunning reversal for a politician who swept the Progressive Conservatives to a historic landslide majority in 1984, and a record second majority in 1988. Canadians, mired in recession, harboured a list of grievances: introduction of the GST and free trade; sending an ill-equipped Canadian military to fight in the Gulf War; a stream of scandals that saw 10 cabinet ministers resign. Mulroney was seen as too showy, too pro-business, too obsequious to power, not the way Canadians saw themselves. Mila Mulroney’s shopping habits won her the mocking nickname “Imelda” after Imelda Marcos. The Mulroneys’ taxpayer-funded global tour—London, Paris, Moscow—to bid farewell to world leaders summoned outrage. Two doomed constitutional initiatives—the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords—left the country divided and the Progressive Conservative party decimated. Lucien Bouchard defected to form the Bloc Québécois. The Kim Campbell-led Progressive Conservatives were crushed in the 1993 election, winning two seats; the party would only recover after a contentious 2003 merger created the Conservative Party of Canada.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-reminder-to-trudeau-canada-barely-survived-brian-mulroneys-constitutional-blunders/"">A reminder to Trudeau: Canada barely survived Brian Mulroney’s constitutional blunders</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Mulroney years—the lobbyists, the conflicts of interest, the backroom deals, with cameos from arms dealers—were a goldmine for investigative journalists; Stevie Cameron’s 1994 <em>On the Take </em>and Marci McDonald’s 1995 <em>Yankee Doodle Dandy </em>were bestsellers. Historian Michael Bliss captured the sentiment in his 1995 book <em>Right Honourable Men: The Descent of Canadian Politics from Macdonald to Mulroney</em>: “Brian Mulroney knew how to lead elites—how to get premiers on side, business groups in his pocket and unity in his caucus, but when he urged Canadians to go over the top with him, they shot him in the back.”</p>\n<p>That year, an aggrieved Mulroney filed an unprecedented $50-million lawsuit against the people he once represented after a Department of Justice letter to the Swiss government on behalf of the RCMP was leaked. It requested information related to allegations that Mulroney and others were involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud taxpayers involving the $1.8-billion purchase of 34 Airbus A320 passenger planes from a European consortium in 1988, with “improper commissions” allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber. “I never had any dealings with him,” Mulroney said under oath. He was awarded $2.1 million for legal and PR costs and the government was ordered to apologize in an out-of-court settlement.</p>\n<p>Mulroney’s frustration over being underappreciated and misunderstood was writ large in Peter C. Newman’s 2005 book <em>The Secret Mulroney Tapes</em>, which captured him in unguarded moments: “You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none,” he is quoted as saying. A more modest, self-deprecating version of history appeared in Mulroney’s bestselling <em>Memoirs</em>, published in 2007. Its 1,100 pages included no mention of Schreiber, then suing Mulroney for the $300,000 he alleged he’d paid the politician for lobbying a German manufacturer of armoured vehicles—work he claimed Mulroney didn’t do.</p>\n<p>In 2007, Stephen Harper ordered a public inquiry, which revealed that Mulroney not only knew Schreiber, who helped fund his leadership bid in 1983, but he accepted no less than $225,000 from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994. Justice Jeffrey Oliphant ruled in his 2010 report that Mulroney did not break any laws or use his influence while prime minister on the contract. Still, the takeaway imagery was tawdry: Mulroney met with Schreiber in three hotel rooms, one in New York City, and was handed envelopes filled with $1,000 bills. Oliphant’s report found “many inappropriate aspects,” including the lack of a paper trail, to deposit it in a bank or pay income tax on it until 2000. The judge also criticized Mulroney for a “heavy-handed” campaign to block a journalist’s story “to protect his reputation.”</p>\n<p>Before the inquiry report was published, that reputation was declared irreparably damaged. “Regardless of what happens now, Brian Mulroney’s credibility and reputation is shattered,” the<em> Tyee </em>wrote in 2007.</p>\n<p>But time passes, and people forget. Time provides hindsight and context, former prime minister Kim Campbell tells <em>Maclean’s</em>. She expresses no bitterness toward Mulroney for leaving her with an unwinnable election and a decimated party: “I don’t blame someone for being human,” she says. “People who make a mark are complicated,” Campbell says. “Brian Mulroney is complicated. He has great skills and annoying flaws.” Campbell was proud to serve in the Mulroney government, she says, where she held a number of cabinet portfolios; she was also the first woman appointed as Canada’s minister of justice and attorney general, where she oversaw key revisions to sexual assault legislation and advocated for more women in the judiciary.</p>\n<p>Campbell cites one Mulroney flaw: his thin skin. He called her former chief of staff to complain about her 1996 political memoir, <em>Time and Chance</em>. She thought she’d treated him fairly: “People said, ‘Why were you so nice to Brian Mulroney?’ I said, ‘I just wrote it as I saw it.’\u2009” Mulroney was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, says Campbell, one of the women Mulroney appointed to powerful cabinet positions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/brian-mulroney-talks-nafta-as-only-he-can/"">Brian Mulroney talks NAFTA as only he can</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Reputations do not rely only on the sands of time. Money and powerful friends can also burnish the record. So can an able PR strategist. (In late 2007, Mulroney hired Robin Sears, a communications and policy consultant with Ottawa-based Earnscliffe Strategy Group.) In her 2012 book <em>Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else</em>, Chrystia Freeland, then a journalist, now minister of foreign affairs, wrote of politics as a path to big money: “One thing that isn’t in dispute is the material value of a political career after leaving office.” Few have been as successful as Mulroney, says Derek Burney, Mulroney’s former chief of staff and former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Retiring politicians of all stripes travel to Montreal for advice on post-political life, he says, as well as the hope of a few connections.</p>\n<p>The powerful networks Mulroney assiduously cultivated before and during his stint in office were there for him afterwards. Mulroney “always noticed people worth noting,” says former Ontario Liberal premier David Peterson, who met Mulroney in Quebec in the ’60s. One of Mulroney’s great successes was identifying George H.W. Bush as the next president, says John Baird, a former minister of foreign affairs and the environment in the Harper government: “He advanced a very warm professional relationship before 1988.”</p>\n<p>People who like Mulroney hold him in great, if not unflinching, affection. “I liked him even when I was mad at him,” says Peterson. “That doesn’t mean I love everything about him. But if I phone Brian Mulroney and say, ‘I need help,’ he’d be the first guy to line up.”</p>\n<p>Mulroney sought common ground to both befriend and as a negotiating tool. Hugh Segal, a former senator who was Mulroney’s chief of staff, recalls asking Mulroney why he requested extensive intel on foreign leaders. “He said, ‘Huey, there’s not a single leader in the world—corporate or political—who wakes up in the morning, turns to his spouse and says: “I wonder how Canada is doing today?” Nobody cares about us. I have to look through that material to find linkages, so if I have to call the president of France or somebody in Africa because some Canadian is in prison, I have a relationship I can build on.’”</p>\n<div id=""attachment_1167221"" style=""width: 820px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BRIAN-MULRONEY-CONNECTIONS.jpg""><img data-sizes=""auto"" class=""size-featured-image-landscape wp-image-1167221 lazyload"" src=""https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BRIAN-MULRONEY-CONNECTIONS-810x445.jpg"" alt="""" width=""810"" height=""445""></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">A selective glimpse into Mulroney’s complex personal, social and business interconnections.

(Photo illustration by Lauren Cattermole)</p></div>\n<p>With his bountiful Rolodex, Mulroney nimbly forged connections between corporate shared interests. He sat on the international advisory board of Beijing-based China International Trust Investment Corp., a state-owned conglomerate that specializes in joint ventures with non-Chinese partners; later, he’d play matchmaker for a Barrick-Power joint venture to develop gold deposits in China.</p>\n<p>Time found some Mulroney policies prescient. In 2006, he was hailed the “greenest” prime minister by the Canadian magazine <em>Corporate Knights</em> for the 1987 Montreal Protocol and the 1991 acid rain treaty. The 25th anniversary of the once-contentious free trade agreement brought more tributes. Ian MacDonald, Mulroney’s main speechwriter in the ’80s, later became the editor of <em>Inside Policy</em> magazine and devoted its first issue to a laudatory free-trade anniversary package. The University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs hosted a symposium.</p>\n<p>Awards and tributes can be a way for the powerful to applaud one another. In 2012, Mulroney, Canada’s first working-class PM, received the Horatio Alger Award, named after the prolific 19th-century American dime-store novelist known for tales of young boys rising from poverty through hard work and honest living. (Other recipients include Ronald Reagan, Fred Trump, Maya Angelou and Leonardo DiCaprio.) Mulroney added “VP of the Horatio Alger Association of Canada” to his crammed CV in 2012. It provided an opportunity to talk publicly about scholarships for poor, worthy students—even if media wanted to revisit the past. In a 2015<em> Maclean’s </em>interview, Mulroney deflected a question about the Oliphant inquiry, saying he’d not read the report. “I’ve been investigated more than any prime minister in Canadian history,” he said. “I have never been charged with a parking ticket.”</p>\n<p>Mulroney’s gift for blarney also inspired devotion, and could even reshape reality. Jean Charest recalls attending caucus as an MP when the government was down in the polls: “We’d walk in at 15 per cent and we’d walk out, in our minds, at 80 per cent,” he told <em>Maclean’s</em>. “He was inspirational every single week.”</p>\n<p>Campbell wonders if one of Mulroney’s perceived failings was appearing to “want it too much.” “He took great pleasure in becoming prime minister. He wasn’t Cincinnatus, who had to be persuaded away from his plough.” History can distort, she says: “People mythologize Pierre Trudeau as a reluctant PM. But, like Mulroney, he also wanted to be PM from an early age.”</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FROM 2015: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-interview-brian-mulroney-on-politics-and-philanthropy/"">The Interview: Brian Mulroney on politics and philanthropy</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Post-politics, Mulroney was never far from political action, helping with the Harper government transition and dispensing advice across the partisan spectrum, including advising former NDP leader Jack Layton on caucus management. “He never went away,” says Peterson. Harper told his cabinet to keep their distance from Mulroney after the Schreiber inquiry began. They didn’t. “It was one of the great secrets of the Harper era that as many as a dozen cabinet ministers would call Mr. Mulroney regularly to complain,” says a Mulroney friend. Mulroney offered advice and valuable contacts, reports Baird, who hosted a private reception for him in 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the acid rain treaty, attended by Bob Rae and Elizabeth May.</p>\n<p>The shock of Trump made Mulroney newly relevant. “The government was scrambling like mad to find a point of traction with the new administration,” says Burney. Mulroney had known Trump for decades. They lunched occasionally in New York; he also often speaks with Jared Kushner, says Burney. His friend Wilbur Ross was named secretary of commerce. Schwarzman, of Blackstone, whose board he’d sat on since 2007, was named head of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum.</p>\n<p>Initial talks between the government and Mulroney focused on the new U.S. government, says Burney (Mulroney declined <em>Maclean’s </em>interview request). He and Mulroney were invited to brief a cabinet committee on NAFTA; they brought together members of their original free-trade team to talk to Freeland, her chief negotiator and people from the PMO. “We each had several discussions with various players over the course of the negotiations,” he says. Mulroney’s message was consistent, Burney says: “Don’t pay attention to the bombast. Don’t play the Twitter game with the guy. Just stick to your guns and stare them down.” They shared their “No deal’s better than a bad deal” mantra from the first round. “I think they appreciated hearing it,” he says. “A lot of members of the cabinet were not even born when the free-trade agreement was concluded.”</p>\n<p>Mulroney provided the public image of a steady hand at the tiller. “There’s movement going on between Canada and the United States at the moment, led by the Prime Minister, and I think it’s all positive,” he told CBC’s <em>Power &amp; Politics </em>in December 2016. He also flattered Trump, calling him “a very solid citizen.” U.S.-Canada trade is “a perfect model,” he said. “They have no problems with us. I think they’re talking mostly about Mexico”—a comment soon seen to have no grounding in reality.</p>\n<p>Mulroney also arranged for Schwarzman, nicknamed “Trump’s China whisperer” for his contacts with that country, to speak at the Liberal caucus retreat in Calgary in January 2017. (Blackstone’s first executive hire in Canada in 2014 was Mulroney’s son-in-law, Andrew Lapham.) In what would be a case of universes colliding, Freeland also met with Schwarzman and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser who sits on Barrick’s international advisory board with Mulroney. As a journalist, Freeland interviewed Schwarzman for <em>Plutocrats</em>, which described his ostentatious 60th birthday party in 2007, just before a market meltdown.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/mulroney-sings-for-trump-at-mar-a-lago/"">Mulroney sings for Trump at Mar-a-Lago</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In March 2017, the Mulroneys dined with Trump and his wife, Melania, at a cancer research fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago; Mulroney reprised history, singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling for another president.</p>\n<p>When the NAFTA deal appeared in peril in September, Mulroney fielded media questions. “Have we missed a chance? You never do in life,” he said. “There’s always another chance.” Weeks later, the deal was signed. It was a big win for Canada, and for Mulroney, says Baird: “All the wins we got in this renegotiation were keeping things he had successfully fought for in the original trade deal.” Baird sees the Liberal validation of Mulroney’s record as a vindication: “[Margaret] Thatcher was once asked what her greatest accomplishment was,” Baird says. “Her response was ‘Tony Blair.’ And in many ways, one of Mr. Mulroney’s greatest accomplishments was to get the Liberal government to be such a champion of free trade.”</p>\n<p>Mulroney was not paid for his advisory role, says a PMO spokesperson. Asked if there was any discussion or screening of potential conflict of interest given Mulroney’s directorships with companies that could be affected by the treaty, the PMO declined to answer. (Liberal legislation did pave the way for another Mulroney board seat—announced on Oct. 17, 2018, the day cannabis was legalized—with New York City-based cannabis company Acreage Holdings.)</p>\n<div id=""attachment_1165941"" style=""width: 820px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img data-sizes=""auto"" class=""wp-image-1165941 size-featured-image-landscape lazyload"" src=""https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BRIAN-MULRONEY-ANNE-KINGSTON02-810x445.jpg"" alt="""" width=""810"" height=""445""><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Former Canadian prime minster Brian Mulroney delivers remarks about former U.S. President George H. W. Bush. (ERIK S. LESSER/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Post-politics, foreign governments honoured Mulroney, who was handed the highest civilian awards from Ukraine, Japan, South Africa and France. His return to the public eye in 2016 provided a moment to highlight his accomplishments on the world stage, says Fen Hampson, professor of international affairs at Carleton University, and author of <em>Master of Persuasion: Brian Mulroney’s Global Legacy</em>, published in 2018. Hampson, who has co-authored op-eds and a 2014 book with Burney, saw a void, he tells <em>Maclean’s</em>: “We remember Mulroney for, shall we say, his indiscretions. But that’s overshadowed by a much more substantiative policy legacy that requires sober second analysis.” The glowing foreword, by former U.S. secretary of state James A. Baker III, sets the tone: “Under Brian Mulroney’s leadership Canada punched well above its weight on the world’s stage.” Hampson writes of Mulroney’s “moral crusade for justice,” highlighting his advocacy to end apartheid in South Africa, which saw him spar with Thatcher, and also giving Canada a respected voice at the G7. “He operated on the theory that ‘I’m not dealing with what’s going to be popular today, I’m doing things that are going to be good for the country in 10 years’ time,’\u2009” says Hampson, who notes Mulroney sat with him for interviews.</p>\n<p>Last year, Mulroney received yet another honour: entry into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame for his “extraordinary contribution to enriching the quality of life for Canadians with physical disabilities.” As PM, Mulroney instructed his finance minister to provide something in the budget for Canadians with disabilities, Burney says, noting Mulroney had three cousins with disabilities; he presents a heroic picture of a young Mulroney carrying them to the shrine of Baie-Comeau’s Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in search of a miracle.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroneys-eulogy-to-george-h-w-bush-full-transcript/"">Brian Mulroney’s eulogy to George H.W. Bush: Video</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Another church, the Washington National Cathedral, would provide a defining Mulroney moment as he represented Canada at the funeral of George H.W. Bush with cabinet minister Scott Brison and U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton. With Trump in the first row, Mulroney employed strategic hyperbole to celebrate the U.S. (“in my judgment, the greatest democratic republic that God has ever placed on the face of this Earth”) and Bush Sr. (“no occupant of the Oval Office was more courageous, more principled and more honourable”). He emphasized their shared legislative legacy—the Clean Air Act that resulted in the acid rain treaty was “a splendid gift to future generations of Americans and Canadians”; NAFTA was “recently modernized and improved by new administrations,” which “created the largest and richest free-trade area in the history of the world.” Bush’s first Gulf War “will rank with the most spectacular and successful international initiatives ever undertaken in modern history,” he said, as sanitized a view of that conflict as could be imagined. Mulroney ended with an Irish proverb: There are wooden ships / There are sailing ships / There are ships that sail the sea / But the best ships are friendships / And may they always be. It was cringingly sentimental. It was also pitch-perfect amid unprecedented political polarity.</p>\n<p>The Mulroney Institute of Government, set to open officially this year at StFX, has been in the works for more than a decade. The institute is the closest Canada has come to erecting a U.S.-style presidential library; Mulroney has called the school, which will offer an undergraduate degree in public policy, a “mini version” of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former British prime minister Tony Blair will lecture, he promised.</p>\n<div id=""attachment_1165939"" style=""width: 820px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img data-sizes=""auto"" class=""wp-image-1165939 size-featured-image-landscape lazyload"" src=""https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BRIAN-MULRONEY-ANNE-KINGSTON03-810x445.jpg"" alt="""" width=""810"" height=""445""><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Renderings for Mulroney Hall at StFX university (Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects)</p></div>\n<p>Cladding on the site featured photos of Mulroney with Reagan and Thatcher, and with Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela. Mulroney Hall will house academic and research labs and offices as well as Mulroney memorabilia, including selected correspondence and a replica of his office as PM. Fundraising began in 2012, with Mulroney collecting close to $60 million himself (he has close ties to StFX, having graduated with a political science B.A. in 1959). His friends were generous, among them Koch, Ross, Gerald Schwartz, Weston, Ron Joyce, Paul Desmarais and Segal. Mulroney personally contributed $1 million. Nova Scotia gave $5 million. In April 2017, the federal government announced $30 million in funding for three campus projects, including the institute. Harper was urged to pony up by members of his cabinet, but did not.</p>\n<p>The legacy project again put investigative journalists to work—and created the headlines associated with Mulroney: proximity to unseemly activities, but no conviction. An international consortium of journalists who looked into donors found two with links to arms sales and tax havens. Victor Dahdaleh, a British-Canadian businessman, and Wafic Saïd, who contributed a combined $5.5 million, both received honorary doctorates from StFX in 2015, though neither attended the university nor has connection to the province. Mulroney sat on the board of the Bermuda-based Said Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2012, according to the Paradise Papers. (In an email, StFX president Kent MacDonald writes that protocols for giving honorary degrees were followed and both men have histories of donating to education internationally.)</p>\n<p>The influx of cash has been transformative on campus, says history professor McInnis. Still, he expresses concern about the sources of some funding, noting commerce secretary Ross’s ties to Russia. How much control donors will have of the curriculum is unclear, he says. “Obviously donors get a say to a certain point. But if it crosses the line into infringing on academic freedom, that’s a concern.” Koch runs the Koch Foundation, whose donations were found to come with a say in the hiring and firing of professors at Virginia’s George Mason University.</p>\n<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">McInnis sees burnishing of not only Mulroney’s reputation but of the Conservative party more generally, pointing to controversy on campus concerning Mulroney receiving the former desk of John A. Macdonald as a parting gift to the PC party in 1993.\xa0Macdonald’s role as a leading Conservative and the architect of residential schools is problematic, he says, given the pressure on the university under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with Indigenous issues. (The Mulroney Institute will fund a $1-million bursary for Indigenous students.)</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Burney refers to Mulroney as “the patriarch of the Conservative party,” even though the party he led no longer exists. “The PC party was a big-tent party that encompassed a lot of different people—Red Tories and social conservatives—and we all had to work together,” says Campbell. “That made it a challenge to lead. It also meant it was a pretty centrist political institution.” Campbell couldn’t survive in today’s Conservative party, she says: “It’s too intolerant; it’s too right-wing.”</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FROM 2013: <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/general/got-7-95-million-the-mulroney-mansion-is-up-for-sale/"">Got $7.95 million? The Mulroney mansion is up for sale</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In recent interviews, Mulroney too has drawn a line, emphasizing his government’s record of increasing the flow of immigrants and refugees into the country. He told <em>Power &amp; Politics of his </em>“firm belief that Canada and other democracies only prosper with great waves of immigration\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Anything that varies from what I just said should be unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>Mulroney’s association with the current Conservatives is complex. He avidly supported his daughter Caroline Mulroney’s run for leadership of the Ontario Conservatives—and the creation of a possible Mulroney political dynasty. In Patrick Brown’s 2018 book <em>Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown</em>, the deposed Ontario Conservative leader reveals that Mulroney promised Brown a place “at the centre” of his daughter’s government if he swung his organizational clout to her campaign for leader—and then for premier. Brown didn’t. Caroline Mulroney, a political neophyte, lost the leadership race but won a seat and was named attorney general in the Doug Ford government.</p>\n<p>Tensions are also said to exist between Andrew Scheer’s team and Mulroney. Scheer spokesperson Daniel Schow is vague when asked about the relationship: “They’ve spoken. They have friends in common. They’re both Conservative politicians.” Mulroney will be diplomatically quiet during the federal election, his spokesperson Sears predicts: “No one expects him to be completely silent. But I think he’ll be more circumspect and less frequent.” Speaking up is a delicate matter, given his daughter’s place in the Ford government. “He is used as a club to beat her with by the Liberals and New Dems,” Sears says. (Friends say Mulroney is not happy about Butt’s tweets that criticize his daughter’s rejection of a carbon tax.) Sears laments Canada’s treatment of retired politicians: “I find it so distressing that when we have a former leader pass from the stage we put them on the iceberg and let them float gently out to sea.” In a conversation held before Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum’s exit, Sears proposes that Mulroney’s skill set could be useful in the current standoff with China. “[Jean] Chrétien and Brian have forgotten more about Canada-China relations than these kids would know in the next 10 years,” he says. “Why not call either of them to make a discreet visit to Beijing to express our sympathies for the unhappiness this situation has caused the both of us and say, ‘Are there any messages you want to convey privately?’\u2009” Using former U.S. presidents to broker such matters is a time-honoured American trick. It’s telling of the political moment, and of Mulroney’s reputational rehab, that it’s an idea not unworthy of consideration.</p>\n<p class=""x_MsoNormal""><strong><em>Correction</em></strong>: An earlier version of this story inaccurately stated that the John A.

Creating a body like the World Anti-Doping Agency to address financial corruption, match-fixing and the influence of organized crime in sport has been talked about for more than a decade without a detailed proposal.
""We at FIFA are ready to invest in it,"" Infantino said, suggesting ""maybe the creation of such an agency would help make sport safe in the decades to come.""
As Infantino spoke at a United Nations event in Austria, the corruption trial was opening in Switzerland of three men, including Qatari soccer and television executive Nasser al-Khelaifi and former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.
Their case arose from years-long American and Swiss investigations of suspected corruption in soccer that removed a generation of international leaders from office and helped lift Infantino to the FIFA presidency in 2016.
His funding pledge was made when signing a cooperation agreement between FIFA and the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which connects international officials and programs.
Speakers at the event included diplomats from Russia and Qatar, winners of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting votes in 2010 that FIFA later asked Swiss federal prosecutors to investigate.
No convictions have been secured in Switzerland, though criminal proceedings are also open against Infantino's predecessor Sepp Blatter and former UEFA President Michel Platini for alleged mismanagement of FIFA funds not directly linked to World Cup bidding. They were questioned in the past two weeks.
""Never again. Never again corruption in football,"" said Infantino, who is himself under investigation in Switzerland over meetings he had with then-attorney general Michael Lauber.
Lauber left office two weeks ago after being disciplined for failing to declare a June 2017 meeting with Infantino where he took no notes and misleading a subsequent internal investigation."

242	Canberk	Reza Zarrab	Person	https://www.duvarenglish.com/economy/2020/09/21/reza-zarrabs-global-money-laundering-scheme-revealed-in-leaked-us-files/	"Shady Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab’s money laundering scheme was revealed in leaked U.S. files.

According to the files, the United Arab Emirates’ central bank, UK-based Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank took part in Zarrab’s scheme.

The FinCEN files are a huge cache of secret reports detailing suspicious financial activity, filed by banks to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD).

BuzzFeed News obtained the files and shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Over the past 16 months, 400 journalists from 88 countries have been investigating the documents.

Leaked documents showed Dubai-based Gunes General Trading, which is alleged by the U.S. prosecutors of being a part of a network controlled by Zarrab that conducted hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under U.S. sanctions, processed $142m in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012.

The activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions, BBC reported.

Suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading

Banks based in the UAE rely on big U.S.-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments – a service known as “correspondent banking.”

Correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filing a document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR).

Among the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran.

SARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing.

The central bank told Standard Chartered that “the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities” and that “accounts were closed in September 2011.”

But Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to “continue its suspicious activity” by “utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks.”

In fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks – Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD).

The FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank.

In April 2013, the U.S. Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a U.S. government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran.

The FinCEN Files also suggest that Deutsche Bank continued to move money for people and companies deemed suspicious, as indicated by SAR filings from the bank, after it received a $258 million fine for violating U.S. sanctions in 2015, Deutsche Welle reported.

Deutsche Bank’s U.S. affiliate, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (TCA), submitted an SAR about a company with close ties to Zarrab to FinCEN in March 2017. The report states that the company, Nadir Döviz, which is involved in the gold trade, had more than $28 million transferred in its name.

Turkey ‘a high-risk country’

Deutsche Bank TCA filed its SAR because Nadir Döviz was being investigated for its involvement in a money-laundering scheme. The document says the transactions occurred between March 2016 and February 2017.

In its report, Deutsche Bank stated that the suspicious activities were intra-company payments dispersed between several Turkish banks. “This SAR is being filed because the transactions originated from a high-risk country [Turkey], there were multiple large, round dollar transactions, and no commercial purpose was identified through the transaction details,” it reads.

One of these suspicious transactions was for $1.5 million from Nadir Döviz in Turkey to Nadir Gold in Dubai on Sept. 12, 2016. No reason was provided for the transfer.

Upon receiving a catalogue of detailed questions from ICIJ, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the information contained in the files is “not new information to us or our regulators” and that these issues date back to the years prior to 2016, adding that Deutsche Bank is “a different bank now.”

In his statement from Sept. 9, the spokesman emphasized: “We acknowledged past weaknesses in our control environment, we apologized for this and accepted our respective fines. Most importantly: We learned from our mistakes, systematically tackled the issues and made changes to our business perimeter, our controls, and our personnel.”

The dates of the recorded Suspicious Activity Reports raise questions about how much Deutsche Bank knew about Döviz’s connection to Zarrab and the Turkish trader’s involvement in what turned out to be a gold for oil scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran.

Reza Zarrab’s billion-dollar scheme

When Iranian banks were cut off from the global SWIFT transaction system, the country’s companies could no longer use international banking transfers to receive payment for oil and gas exports.

To get around the ban, Iran began collecting gold as payments instead. Reza Zarrab played a key role in this billion-dollar scheme to help Iran evade sanctions.

Zarrab was first indicted and arrested in December 2013 in Turkey, as part of a larger corruption investigation aimed at ministers in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Among the charges directed at him were bribing ministers, money laundering and gold smuggling.

According to a report by Turkish prosecutors at the time, Zarrab used Nadir Döviz for buying gold. Zarrab’s bagman Adem Karahan later told Turkish daily Cumhuriyet, that he was a cash courier for money going from Dubai to Turkey and from Dubai to Iran.

One of the companies he received money from was Nadir Gold LLC, a subsidiary of Nadir Döviz in Dubai. It is precisely these two companies that Deutsche Bank lists in its March 2017 Suspicious Activity Report to FinCEN.

At the time, the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan refuted all allegations against Zarrab and likened the investigation to a coup attempt, purging and arresting the prosecutors who initiated it. After two and a half months in prison, Zarrab was released.

In March 2016 Zarrab was arrested again, this time in the U.S. while on route to Disney World with his family. U.S. authorities accused him of money laundering, fraud and helping the Iranian government to evade the economic sanctions.

He pleaded guilty and later testified as a protected star witness in a trial against a manager of Turkey’s Halkbank.

During this trial in November 2017, Zarrab claimed that Turkish government officials, including Erdoğan, had allowed Halkbank to create a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold to help Iran get around U.S. sanctions."

Over the past 16 months, 400 journalists from 88 countries have been investigating the documents.\n\nLeaked documents showed Dubai-based Gunes General Trading, which is alleged by the U.S. prosecutors of being a part of a network controlled by Zarrab that conducted hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under U.S. sanctions, processed $142m in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions, BBC reported.\n\nSuspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading\n\nBanks based in the UAE rely on big U.S.-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments – a service known as “correspondent banking.”\n\nCorrespondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filing a document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR).\n\nAmong the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran.\n\nSARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe central bank told Standard Chartered that “the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities” and that “accounts were closed in September 2011.”\n\nBut Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to “continue its suspicious activity” by “utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks.”\n\nIn fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks – Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD).\n\nThe FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank.\n\nIn April 2013, the U.S. Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a U.S. government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran.\n\nThe FinCEN Files also suggest that Deutsche Bank continued to move money for people and companies deemed suspicious, as indicated by SAR filings from the bank, after it received a $258 million fine for violating U.S. sanctions in 2015, Deutsche Welle reported.\n\nDeutsche Bank’s U.S. affiliate, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (TCA), submitted an SAR about a company with close ties to Zarrab to FinCEN in March 2017. The report states that the company, Nadir Döviz, which is involved in the gold trade, had more than $28 million transferred in its name.\n\nTurkey ‘a high-risk country’\n\nDeutsche Bank TCA filed its SAR because Nadir Döviz was being investigated for its involvement in a money-laundering scheme. The document says the transactions occurred between March 2016 and February 2017.\n\nIn its report, Deutsche Bank stated that the suspicious activities were intra-company payments dispersed between several Turkish banks. “This SAR is being filed because the transactions originated from a high-risk country [Turkey], there were multiple large, round dollar transactions, and no commercial purpose was identified through the transaction details,” it reads.\n\nOne of these suspicious transactions was for $1.5 million from Nadir Döviz in Turkey to Nadir Gold in Dubai on Sept. 12, 2016. No reason was provided for the transfer.\n\nUpon receiving a catalogue of detailed questions from ICIJ, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the information contained in the files is “not new information to us or our regulators” and that these issues date back to the years prior to 2016, adding that Deutsche Bank is “a different bank now.”\n\nIn his statement from Sept. 9, the spokesman emphasized: “We acknowledged past weaknesses in our control environment, we apologized for this and accepted our respective fines. Most importantly: We learned from our mistakes, systematically tackled the issues and made changes to our business perimeter, our controls, and our personnel.”\n\nThe dates of the recorded Suspicious Activity Reports raise questions about how much Deutsche Bank knew about Döviz’s connection to Zarrab and the Turkish trader’s involvement in what turned out to be a gold for oil scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran.\n\nReza Zarrab’s billion-dollar scheme\n\nWhen Iranian banks were cut off from the global SWIFT transaction system, the country’s companies could no longer use international banking transfers to receive payment for oil and gas exports.\n\nTo get around the ban, Iran began collecting gold as payments instead.

184	Carel	Eric Cantor	Individual	https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/16/177496734/how-congress-quietly-overhauled-its-insider-trading-law?t=1605298328331	"The legislative process on Capitol Hill is often slow and grinding. There are committee hearings, filibuster threats and hours of floor debate. But sometimes, when Congress really wants to get something done, it can move blindingly fast.

That's what happened when Congress moved to undo large parts of a popular law known as the STOCK Act last week.

A year ago, President Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act into law at a celebratory ceremony attended by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers.

""I want to thank all the members of Congress who came together and worked to get this done,"" he said.

The law wouldn't just outlaw trading on nonpublic information by members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs. It would greatly expand financial disclosures and make all of the data searchable so insider trading and conflicts of interest would be easier to detect.

But on Monday, when the president signed a bill reversing big pieces of the law, the emailed announcement was one sentence long. There was no fanfare last week either, when the Senate and then the House passed the bill in largely empty chambers using a fast-track procedure known as unanimous consent.

In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., shepherded the bill through. It was Friday afternoon at 12:52. Many members had already left for the weekend or were on their way out. The whole process took only 30 seconds. There was no debate.

""There weren't too many members of Congress who were aware of this legislation,"" says Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. ""And I suspect very, very few understood what a sweeping radical change it is to the STOCK Act.""

Records In The Basement

To understand how the law changed, I asked Holman to meet me in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building.

""This is where the public records are kept, for those who can handle traveling to Washington, D.C.,"" Holman explained.

That's right. If you want to look up the financial disclosure forms filed by high-level congressional staffers — say, to find out whether they've been using the privileges of their positions to make well-timed stock trades — you have to come to this office.

Holman showed me how it works. You have to enter your name and address into a computer, and then you can search. But you have to know the name of the person you are searching for. If he or she has filed a financial disclosure form, it will come up as a PDF, which you can print at a cost of 10 cents a page.

""The database itself is almost meaningless,"" says Holman. He says the only option for those who want to get a comprehensive look at what some 2,900 staffers have filed is to review the cases one by one. ""And that's just too big a job for anybody to do.""

The STOCK Act was supposed to make this task significantly easier. Records for members of Congress, the executive branch and their staffs were supposed to be posted online in a searchable, sortable and downloadable format.

If you wanted to see who traded health care stock just before a committee acted on a health care bill, it would be easy. No trips to the basement required.

But there were concerns, especially among the 28,000 executive branch staff who would be required to post their financial disclosures online.

Going Too Far?

""There were particular concerns about risks for those who either travel overseas on government business or work overseas,"" says Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, who represents many of those executive branch employees.

An independent study said there were also risks of identity theft, which she says the new law helps avoid.

""What has been eliminated now is the ability of people to go phishing, if you will,"" she says.

The White House cited the independent report in explaining why the president signed the bill. And a spokesman for Cantor said the House and Senate were simply following recommendations of the study. But Lisa Rosenberg, a lobbyist for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocated for the STOCK Act, says Congress went too far.

""It's really shocking that they used basically the situation of questions about whether some language in the bill was overbroad to just gut the bill — to gut the transparency measures that apply to themselves,"" she says.

Still, two major elements of the law remain. Insider trading is illegal, even for members of Congress and the executive branch. And for those who are covered by the now-narrower law, disclosures of large stock trades are required within 45 days. It will just be harder to get to them."

71	Sebastien	Lamine Diack	individual	https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/54176537	"Lamine Diack, the ex-head of athletics' governing body, has been jailed after being found guilty of corruption.

The Senegalese, 87, faced corruption and money-laundering charges linked to the Russian doping scandal.

Diack was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was sentenced to four years in prison, two of them suspended.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".

Diack, who was also given a maximum fine of 500,000 euros (£456,928), was investigated by French authorities for four years over claims he took payments of more than 3m euros to cover up cheating.

The judge said his actions had ""undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping"".

Diack has been under house arrest in Paris since November 2015.

Previously one of the most influential figures in world sport, Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics' Federations - now World Athletics - for 16 years until he was replaced by Britain's Lord Coe in August 2015.

Diack's son Papa Massata Diack - who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 - was sentenced to five years in prison and a given a 1m euros fine (£913,850).

After the ruling, World Athletics released a statement in which it said it was ""disappointed this happened in our sport"" but ""grateful for the strong and clear decisions that have been taken against the individuals involved"".

Athletics' governing body added that it would like to ""reassure everyone that the reforms our congress approved in 2016 will ensure that similar actions by individuals can never happen again in our sport"".

""We are grateful for the damages awarded by the Paris Criminal Court totalling 16m euros for embezzled funds and for reputational damage suffered as a direct consequence of these crimes and the resulting media coverage,"" it added.

""As the court acknowledged, this damage has impacted World Athletics' finances and had a negative impact on World Athletics' image and reputation in a deep and lasting way. We will do everything we can to recover the monies awarded, and return them to the organisation for the development of athletics globally."""

The 82-year-old former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was questioned for over six hours on October 19 in the case.

After the questioning on Monday, Abdullah had said he was not worried and would cooperate in the probe.

The last round of questioning took place four days after Jammu and Kashmir's mainstream political parties, including the NC and the PDP, met at Abdullah's residence and formed the People's Alliance for 'Gupkar Declaration'.

ED officials said Abdullah's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as in the past. He was questioned for the first time in July last year in Chandigarh.

The ED is understood to be questioning Abdullah about his role and decisions taken when the alleged fraud took place in the association when he was the JKCA president.

The agency's case is based on an FIR filed by the CBI, which booked former JKCA office-bearers, including general secretary Mohammed Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza.

The CBI had also filed a charge sheet in 2018 against Abdullah, Khan, Mirza as well as former JKCA treasurer Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali and former accountants Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh for the ""misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore"" from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to promote the sport in the erstwhile state between 2002 and 2011.

Present Bush today announced that the U.S. Treasury is designating five Hamas related charities and six senior Hamas leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), freezing any assets in the U.S. and prohibiting transactions with U.S. nationals. �By claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinian people,� President Bush stated.

�Hamas� leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands,� U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow stated. �Empty words cannot wash them clean. As they resist the road map for peace, Hamas is devastating the dreams of the Palestinian people for freedom, prosperity, and an independent state.�

The United States will continue to work with our allies to encourage the recognition of Hamas as a terrorist organization and to shut down their sources of funding and support.

The following individuals are designated as SDGTs by today�s action:

Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas in Gaza.
Imad Khalil Al-Alami, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria.
Usama Hamdan, a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon.
Khalid Mishaal, head of the Hamas Political Bureau and Executive Committee in Damascus, Syria.
Musa Abu Marzouk, Deputy Chief of the Political Bureau in Syria.
Abdel Aziz Rantisi, a Hamas leader in Gaza reporting to Sheik Yassin.

The following charities that provide support to Hamas and form part of its funding network in Europe are designated as well:

Commite de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (CBSP), of France.
The Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP), of Switzerland. (An organization related to CBSP)
The Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, or Interpal, headquartered in the United Kingdom.
The Palestinian Association in Austria, PVOE.
The Sanabil Association for Relief and Development, based in Lebanon .

Today�s action follows several actions taken against Hamas previously, including the designation of several entities that formed part of the Hamas network such as Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and the Al Aqsa Foundation, key sources of financial support for Hamas.

ATTACHED: Fact Sheet

HAMAS

HAMAS is a terrorist organization that has intentionally killed hundreds of innocent civilians and continues to kill and maim with the aim of terrorizing a civilian population. HAMAS was formed in 1987 as an outgrowth of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. HAMAS activists have conducted many attacks � including large-scale suicide bombings � against Israeli citizens and military targets. In the early 1990s, they also targeted U.S. citizens, suspected Palestinian collaborators and Fatah rivals.

During 2002, more than 370 persons � including 10 US citizens � were killed in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by acts of terrorism. HAMAS was responsible for carrying out more than 50 of these attacks, including shootings, suicide bombings, and standoff mortar-and-rocket attacks against civilian and military targets. The group was responsible for the most deadly Palestinian terrorist attack of the year � the suicide bombings of a Passover gathering at a Netanya hotel that killed 29 Israelis, including one dual US-Israeli citizen. HAMAS's bombing of a cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus, which killed nine, including five US citizens, demonstrated its willingness to stage operations in areas frequented by students and tourists, including US citizens.

In addition, HAMAS's rejectionist policies and terrorist actions are aimed at derailing the peace process in the Middle East. On April 30, 2003, the U.S. government released the roadmap for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, which constitutes a crucial step in international efforts to actively support movement towards peace in the region. HAMAS, however, has since the mid-90s purposefully worked against all regional peace efforts by engaging in suicide attacks and other acts of the most violent type of terrorism. On June 8 and June 11 HAMAS took credit for attacks against Israelis. The organization also took credit for four suicide bombings in a 24-hour period during the weekend preceding May 20th.

On June 29th, HAMAS and two other designated terrorist groups announced a cease-fire. On August 19th, a suicide bomber detonated his bomb in the back of a double-length city bus near the border between east and west Jerusalem. According to a CNN report, HAMAS said that it was committed to the cease-fire, but also claimed responsibility, stating that �the man was a member of its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and the attack came in revenge for the killing of two of its members.� As noted by the Human Rights Watch, �the Hamas leadership has pursued attacks against civilians as a conscious policy. A group that pursues multiple, intentional attacks against civilians as a matter of policy is responsible for crimes against humanity.� Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians at 67 (October 2002).

Under Executive Order 13224, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�

Yassin is the head of HAMAS in Gaza. He maintains a direct line of communication with other HAMAS leaders on coordination of HAMAS's military activities and openly admits that there is no distinguishing the political and military wings of Hamas. Yassin

also conveys messages about operational planning to other Palestinian terrorist organizations.

Surrounding Y

assin is an entourage of personal ""bodyguards,"" including many implicated in providing information and supplies to fugitives, recruiting personnel to undertake military operations, planning terrorist cells, attacking settlements, and manufacturing weapons and explosives.

I

mad Khalil AL-ALAMI

Imad al-Alami is a member of HAMAS's Political Bureau, located in Damascus, Syria and a military operations leader. As part of HAMAS's external leadership, he is part of the most effective and powerful wing of HAMAS because it controls the West Bank and prison branches of HAMAS and has gained total financial control.

Al-Alami has had oversight responsibility for the military wing of HAMAS within the Palestinian territories. As a HAMAS military leader, al-Alami directs sending personnel and funding to the West Bank and Gaza.

U

sama HAMDAN

Hamdan, a senior HAMAS official based in Lebanon, maintains contact with representatives with other terrorist organizations with the purpose of strengthening the ties between these organizations in order to strengthen an international Islamic Jihad. He has worked with other HAMAS and Hizballah leaders on initiatives to develop and activate the military network inside the Palestinian territories in support of the current intifada, including the movement of weapons, explosives and personnel to the West Bank and Gaza for HAMAS fighters.

Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian �martyrs� have been transferred to the bank account of Hamdan and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.

Khalid MISHAAL

Mishaal is the chief of HAMAS's Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria and heads HAMAS's Executive Committee and Special Office. Cells in the military wing based in the West Bank that are under Mishaal's control have been implicated in efforts by HAMAS to plan large attacks that would undermine the ""road map"" peace plan.

Mishaal has been responsible for supervising assassination operations, bombings and the killing of Israeli settlers. To execute HAMAS military activities, Mishaal maintains a direct link to Gaza-based HAMAS leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi (see below). He also provides instructions to other parts of the HAMAS military wing.

Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian martyrs have been transferred to the bank account of Mishaal and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.

Musa Abu MARZOUK

Musa Abu Marzouk is the Deputy Chief of HAMAS's Political Bureau based in Damascus, Syria. His activities include directing and coordinating terrorist acts by HAMAS against soldiers and civilians in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. Marzouk maintains relationships with other terrorist organizations.

The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001 based on its support of HAMAS, received start-up funding and instructions from Marzouk. Marzouk is implicated in receiving financing for HAMAS terrorist attacks, funds that have been used to mobilize military activity inside Israel and the West Bank/Gaza.

Abdel Aziz RANTISI

Rantisi is part of the HAMAS leadership in Gaza, operating directly under HAMAS Leader Shaykh Yassin (see above) with whom he maintains a direct line of communication for the coordination of military operations. Mishaal (see above) has also issued orders for HAMAS terrorist activities through R

antisi.

In October of 2002, Rantisi was reported in Al-Hayat as personally claiming responsibility for the assassination of a Palestinian Authority Police Colonel. In December 2002, he was calling for Iraq to prepare thousands of martyrdom cells to fight the United States and its allies in the event of war.

HAMAS Fundraising

HAMAS raises tens of millions or dollars per year throughout the world using charitable fundraising as cover. While HAMAS may provide money for legitimate charitable work, this work is a primary recruiting tool for the organization's militant causes. HAMAS relies on donations from Palestinian expatriates around the world and private benefactors located in moderate Arab states, Western Europe and North America. HAMAS uses a web of charities to facilitate funding and to funnel money. Charitable donations to non-governmental organizations are commingled, moved between charities in ways that hide the money trail, and then often diverted or siphoned to support terrorism.

The funds pouring into HAMAS coffers directly undermine the Middle East peace process. These funds allow the group to continue to foment violence, strengthen its terrorist infrastructure, and undermine responsible leadership.

The political leadership of HAMAS directs its terrorist networks just as they oversee their other activities. HAMAS leader Yassin confirms this relationship, stating to al-Sharq al-Awsat on August 12, 2002: ""When we make decisions on the political level and convey them to the military wing, it abides by it normally.� The intensity of this relationship is reflected in Yassin's words quoted by Reuters on May 12, 1998:

We can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. HAMAS is one body.

A report issued by Human Rights Watch has also noted the unified nature of HAMAS:

In the case of Hamas, there is abundant evidence that the military wing is accountable to a political steering committee . . . . Yassin himself, as well as Salah Shehadah, the late founder and commander of the �Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, have confirmed in public remarks that the military wing implements policies that are set by the political wing.� Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians at 63 (October 2002).

Fundraising may involve community solicitation in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Middle East or solicitations directly to wealthy donors. While some donors may be aware of the intended use of their donations, too many innocent donors who intend for their money to be used to provide humanitarian services here or abroad, are unwittingly funding acts of violence when these funds are diverted to terrorist causes.

HAMAS fundraising directly undermines Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas's ability to clamp down on this terrorist organization. One of the obstacles and threats to establishing a meaningful dialogue toward peace comes from terrorist groups such as HAMAS, which view peace discussions as inimical to their interests and are intent on undermining the multilateral work on the roadmap by fomenting violence. In order to support momentum towards peace, to strengthen the ability of the new Palestinian leadership to take the actions it must take against HAMAS, the assets of groups like HAMAS must be frozen, as well as the assets of organizations raising funds for such terrorist groups.

E.O. 13224 provides a means to disrupt the financial-support network funding terrorist attacks committed by HAMAS. Under this Order, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�

The United States government has credible evidence that the following five organizations are part of a web of charities raising funds on behalf of HAMAS and using humanitarians purposes as a cover for acts that support HAMAS. Funds are generated by, and flow through, these organizations on behalf of HAMAS.

C

ommite de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (CBSP) and Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP)

CBSP and ASP are primary fundraisers for HAMAS in France and Switzerland, respectively. Founded in France in the late 80s/early 90s, CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. ASP, a subsidiary of CBSP, was founded in Switzerland in 1994. The group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers to sub-organizations of HAMAS. Khalid Al-S

huli is the president of CBSP and ASP . nterpal)

Interpal, headquartered in the UK, has been a principal charity utilized to hide the flow of money to HAMAS. Reporting indicates it is the conduit through which money flows to HAMAS from other charities, e.g., the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated under EO 13224 on May 29th) and oversees the activities of other charities. For example, the Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (designated as part of this tranche), represents Interpal in Lebanon. Reporting indicates that Interpal is the fundraising coordinator of HAMAS. This role is of the type that includes supervising activities of charities, developing new charities in targeted areas, instructing how funds should be transferred from one charity to another, and even determining public relations policy.

PVOE is controlled by the leader of HAMAS in Austria. The money is targeted to support members of HAMAS and is funneled through other charities in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza or other areas of the Middle East in order to ensure the transfer of funds is undetected and reaches its intended recipients. PVOE is part of the HAMAS net work of charitable organizations that includes the Al Aqsa Foundation.

S

anabil Association for Relief and Development

The Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (Sanabil), based in Sidon, Lebanon, receives large quantities of funds raised by major HAMAS-affiliated charities in Europe and the Middle East and, in turn, provides funding to HAMAS. For example, Sanabil has received funding from the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in May 2003); the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001), and Interpal (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 as part of this tranche). HAMAS recruits permanent members from the religious and the poor by extending charity to them from organizations such as S

anabil.

At the request of a HAMAS political leader, Sanabil began opening offices in all of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August of 2001 in order to increase the foundation's role inside the camps. After starting by providing basic necessities the charity eventually began asking poor families within the camps to fill out application forms, particularly those who had worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-Haraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result of these efforts, S

anabil has increased its scope of influence within the camps."

As part of HAMAS\'s external leadership, he is part of the most effective and powerful wing of HAMAS because it controls the West Bank and prison branches of HAMAS and has gained total financial control.\n\nAl-Alami has had oversight responsibility for the military wing of HAMAS within the Palestinian territories. As a HAMAS military leader, al-Alami directs sending personnel and funding to the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nU\n\nsama HAMDAN\n\nHamdan, a senior HAMAS official based in Lebanon, maintains contact with representatives with other terrorist organizations with the purpose of strengthening the ties between these organizations in order to strengthen an international Islamic Jihad. He has worked with other HAMAS and Hizballah leaders on initiatives to develop and activate the military network inside the Palestinian territories in support of the current intifada, including the movement of weapons, explosives and personnel to the West Bank and Gaza for HAMAS fighters.\n\nFunds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian �martyrs� have been transferred to the bank account of Hamdan and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.\n\nKhalid MISHAAL\n\nMishaal is the chief of HAMAS\'s Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria and heads HAMAS\'s Executive Committee and Special Office. Cells in the military wing based in the West Bank that are under Mishaal\'s control have been implicated in efforts by HAMAS to plan large attacks that would undermine the ""road map"" peace plan.\n\nMishaal has been responsible for supervising assassination operations, bombings and the killing of Israeli settlers. To execute HAMAS military activities, Mishaal maintains a direct link to Gaza-based HAMAS leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi (see below). He also provides instructions to other parts of the HAMAS military wing.\n\nFunds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian martyrs have been transferred to the bank account of Mishaal and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.\n\nMusa Abu MARZOUK\n\nMusa Abu Marzouk is the Deputy Chief of HAMAS\'s Political Bureau based in Damascus, Syria. His activities include directing and coordinating terrorist acts by HAMAS against soldiers and civilians in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. Marzouk maintains relationships with other terrorist organizations.\n\nThe Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001 based on its support of HAMAS, received start-up funding and instructions from Marzouk. Marzouk is implicated in receiving financing for HAMAS terrorist attacks, funds that have been used to mobilize military activity inside Israel and the West Bank/Gaza.\n\nAbdel Aziz RANTISI\n\nRantisi is part of the HAMAS leadership in Gaza, operating directly under HAMAS Leader Shaykh Yassin (see above) with whom he maintains a direct line of communication for the coordination of military operations. Mishaal (see above) has also issued orders for HAMAS terrorist activities through R\n\nantisi.\n\nIn October of 2002, Rantisi was reported in Al-Hayat as personally claiming responsibility for the assassination of a Palestinian Authority Police Colonel. In December 2002, he was calling for Iraq to prepare thousands of martyrdom cells to fight the United States and its allies in the event of war.\n\nHAMAS Fundraising\n\nHAMAS raises tens of millions or dollars per year throughout the world using charitable fundraising as cover. While HAMAS may provide money for legitimate charitable work, this work is a primary recruiting tool for the organization\'s militant causes. HAMAS relies on donations from Palestinian expatriates around the world and private benefactors located in moderate Arab states, Western Europe and North America. HAMAS uses a web of charities to facilitate funding and to funnel money. Charitable donations to non-governmental organizations are commingled, moved between charities in ways that hide the money trail, and then often diverted or siphoned to support terrorism.\n\nThe funds pouring into HAMAS coffers directly undermine the Middle East peace process. These funds allow the group to continue to foment violence, strengthen its terrorist infrastructure, and undermine responsible leadership.\n\nThe political leadership of HAMAS directs its terrorist networks just as they oversee their other activities. HAMAS leader Yassin confirms this relationship, stating to al-Sharq al-Awsat on August 12, 2002: ""When we make decisions on the political level and convey them to the military wing, it abides by it normally.� The intensity of this relationship is reflected in Yassin\'s words quoted by Reuters on May 12, 1998:\n\nWe can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. HAMAS is one body.\n\nA report issued by Human Rights Watch has also noted the unified nature of HAMAS:\n\nIn the case of Hamas, there is abundant evidence that the military wing is accountable to a political steering committee . . . . Yassin himself, as well as Salah Shehadah, the late founder and commander of the �Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, have confirmed in public remarks that the military wing implements policies that are set by the political wing.� Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians at 63 (October 2002).\n\nFundraising may involve community solicitation in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Middle East or solicitations directly to wealthy donors. While some donors may be aware of the intended use of their donations, too many innocent donors who intend for their money to be used to provide humanitarian services here or abroad, are unwittingly funding acts of violence when these funds are diverted to terrorist causes.\n\nHAMAS fundraising directly undermines Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas\'s ability to clamp down on this terrorist organization. One of the obstacles and threats to establishing a meaningful dialogue toward peace comes from terrorist groups such as HAMAS, which view peace discussions as inimical to their interests and are intent on undermining the multilateral work on the roadmap by fomenting violence. In order to support momentum towards peace, to strengthen the ability of the new Palestinian leadership to take the actions it must take against HAMAS, the assets of groups like HAMAS must be frozen, as well as the assets of organizations raising funds for such terrorist groups.\n\nE.O. 13224 provides a means to disrupt the financial-support network funding terrorist attacks committed by HAMAS. Under this Order, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�\n\nThe United States government has credible evidence that the following five organizations are part of a web of charities raising funds on behalf of HAMAS and using humanitarians purposes as a cover for acts that support HAMAS. Funds are generated by, and flow through, these organizations on behalf of HAMAS.\n\nC\n\nommite de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (CBSP) and Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP)\n\nCBSP and ASP are primary fundraisers for HAMAS in France and Switzerland, respectively. Founded in France in the late 80s/early 90s, CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. ASP, a subsidiary of CBSP, was founded in Switzerland in 1994. The group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers to sub-organizations of HAMAS. Khalid Al-S\n\nhuli is the president of CBSP and ASP . nterpal)\n\nInterpal, headquartered in the UK, has been a principal charity utilized to hide the flow of money to HAMAS. Reporting indicates it is the conduit through which money flows to HAMAS from other charities, e.g., the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated under EO 13224 on May 29th) and oversees the activities of other charities. For example, the Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (designated as part of this tranche), represents Interpal in Lebanon. Reporting indicates that Interpal is the fundraising coordinator of HAMAS. This role is of the type that includes supervising activities of charities, developing new charities in targeted areas, instructing how funds should be transferred from one charity to another, and even determining public relations policy.\n\nPVOE is controlled by the leader of HAMAS in Austria. The money is targeted to support members of HAMAS and is funneled through other charities in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza or other areas of the Middle East in order to ensure the transfer of funds is undetected and reaches its intended recipients. PVOE is part of the HAMAS net work of charitable organizations that includes the Al Aqsa Foundation.\n\nS\n\nanabil Association for Relief and Development\n\nThe Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (Sanabil), based in Sidon, Lebanon, receives large quantities of funds raised by major HAMAS-affiliated charities in Europe and the Middle East and, in turn, provides funding to HAMAS. For example, Sanabil has received funding from the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in May 2003); the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001), and Interpal (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 as part of this tranche). HAMAS recruits permanent members from the religious and the poor by extending charity to them from organizations such as S\n\nanabil.\n\nAt the request of a HAMAS political leader, Sanabil began opening offices in all of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August of 2001 in order to increase the foundation\'s role inside the camps. After starting by providing basic necessities the charity eventually began asking poor families within the camps to fill out application forms, particularly those who had worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-Haraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result of these efforts, S\n\nanabil has increased its scope of influence within the camps.', 'authorsList': ['Sheik Ahmed YASSIN'], 'breadcrumbs': [{'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Home'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Press Center'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/default.aspx', 'name': 'Press Releases'}, {'link': 'https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js672.aspx', 'name': 'U.S. Designates Five Charities Funding Hamas and Six Senior Hamas Leaders as Terrorist Entities'}], 'description': 'Present Bush today announced that the U.S. Treasury is designating five Hamas related charities and six senior Hamas leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), freezing any assets in the U.S. and prohibiting transactions with U.S. nationals. �By claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinian people,� President Bush stated.

the U.S. Treasury is designating five Hamas related charities and six senior Hamas leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), freezing any assets in the U.S. and prohibiting transactions with U.S. nationals. �By claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinian people,� President Bush stated.</p>\n\n<p>�Hamas� leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands,� U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow stated. �Empty words cannot wash them clean. As they resist the road map for peace, Hamas is devastating the dreams of the Palestinian people for freedom, prosperity, and an independent state.�</p>\n\n<p>The United States will continue to work with our allies to encourage the recognition of Hamas as a terrorist organization and to shut down their sources of funding and support.</p>\n\n<p>The following individuals are designated as SDGTs by today�s action:</p>\n\n<ol><li><strong>Sheik Ahmed Yassin</strong>, the leader of Hamas in Gaza. </li>\n<li><strong>Imad Khalil Al-Alami</strong>, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria. </li>\n<li><strong>Usama Hamdan</strong>, a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon. </li>\n<li><strong>Khalid Mishaal</strong>, head of the Hamas Political Bureau and Executive Committee in Damascus, Syria. </li>\n<li><strong>Musa Abu Marzouk</strong>, Deputy Chief of the Political Bureau in Syria. </li>\n<li><strong>Abdel Aziz Rantisi, </strong>a Hamas leader in Gaza reporting to Sheik Yassin. </li></ol>\n\n<p>The following charities that provide support to Hamas and form part of its funding network in Europe are designated as well:</p>\n\n<ol><li><strong>Commite de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (CBSP), </strong>of France. </li>\n<li><strong>The Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP), </strong>of Switzerland. (An organization related to CBSP) </li>\n<li><strong>The Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, or Interpal, </strong>headquartered in the United Kingdom. </li>\n<li><strong>The Palestinian Association in Austria, </strong>PVOE. </li>\n<li><strong>The Sanabil Association for Relief and Development, </strong>based in Lebanon <strong>.</strong></li></ol>\n\n<p>Today�s action follows several actions taken against Hamas previously, including the designation of several entities that formed part of the Hamas network such as Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and the Al Aqsa Foundation, key sources of financial support for Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>ATTACHED: Fact Sheet</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>HAMAS </strong></u></p>\n\n<p>HAMAS is a terrorist organization that has intentionally killed hundreds of innocent civilians and continues to kill and maim with the aim of terrorizing a civilian population. \xa0 HAMAS was formed in 1987 as an outgrowth of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. \xa0 HAMAS activists have conducted many attacks � including large-scale suicide bombings � against Israeli citizens and military targets. \xa0 In the early 1990s, they also targeted U.S. citizens, suspected Palestinian collaborators and Fatah rivals.</p>\n\n<p>During 2002, more than 370 persons � including 10 US citizens � were killed in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by acts of terrorism. \xa0\xa0 HAMAS was responsible for carrying out more than 50 of these attacks, including shootings, suicide bombings, and standoff mortar-and-rocket attacks against civilian and military targets. \xa0 The group was responsible for the most deadly Palestinian terrorist attack of the year � the suicide bombings of a Passover gathering at a Netanya hotel that killed 29 Israelis, including one dual US-Israeli citizen. \xa0\xa0 HAMAS\'s bombing of a cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus, which killed nine, including five US citizens, demonstrated its willingness to stage operations in areas frequented by students and tourists, including US citizens.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, HAMAS\'s rejectionist policies and terrorist actions are aimed at derailing the peace process in the Middle East. \xa0 On April 30, 2003, the U.S. government released the roadmap for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, which constitutes a crucial step in international efforts to actively support movement towards peace in the region. \xa0\xa0 HAMAS, however, has since the mid-90s purposefully worked against all regional peace efforts by engaging in suicide attacks and other acts of the most violent type of terrorism. \xa0\xa0 On June 8 and June 11 HAMAS took credit for attacks against Israelis. \xa0 The organization also took credit for four suicide bombings in a 24-hour period during the weekend preceding May 20th.</p>\n\n<p>On June 29th, HAMAS and two other designated terrorist groups announced a cease-fire. On August 19th, a suicide bomber detonated his bomb in the back of a double-length city bus near the border between east and west Jerusalem. \xa0 According to a CNN report, HAMAS said that it was committed to the cease-fire, but also claimed responsibility, stating that �the man was a member of its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and the attack came in revenge for the killing of two of its members.� \xa0 As noted by the Human Rights Watch, �the Hamas leadership has pursued attacks against civilians as a conscious policy. \xa0 A group that pursues multiple, intentional attacks against civilians as a matter of policy is responsible for crimes against humanity.� <em>Erased in a Moment: \xa0 Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians </em>at 67 (October 2002).</p>\n\n<p>Under Executive Order 13224, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. \xa0 HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�</p>\n\n<p>Yassin is the head of HAMAS in Gaza. \xa0 He maintains a direct line of communication with other HAMAS leaders on coordination of HAMAS\'s military activities and openly admits that there is no distinguishing the political and military wings of Hamas. \xa0 Yassin</p>\n\n<p>also conveys messages about operational planning to other Palestinian terrorist organizations.</p>\n\n<p>Surrounding Y</p>\n\n<p>assin is an entourage of personal ""bodyguards,"" including many implicated in providing information and supplies to fugitives, recruiting personnel to undertake military operations, planning terrorist cells, attacking settlements, and manufacturing weapons and explosives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\nmad Khalil AL-ALAMI </strong></p>\n\n<p>Imad al-Alami is a member of HAMAS\'s Political Bureau, located in Damascus, Syria and a military operations leader. \xa0 As part of HAMAS\'s external leadership, he is part of the most effective and powerful wing of HAMAS because it controls the West Bank and prison branches of HAMAS and has gained total financial control.</p>\n\n<p>Al-Alami has had oversight responsibility for the military wing of HAMAS within the Palestinian territories. \xa0 As a HAMAS military leader, al-Alami directs sending personnel and funding to the West Bank and Gaza.</p>\n\n<p><strong>U</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\nsama HAMDAN </strong></p>\n\n<p>Hamdan, a senior HAMAS official based in Lebanon, maintains contact with representatives with other terrorist organizations with the purpose of strengthening the ties between these organizations in order to strengthen an international Islamic Jihad. \xa0 He has worked with other HAMAS and Hizballah leaders on initiatives to develop and activate the military network inside the Palestinian territories in support of the current intifada, including the movement of weapons, explosives and personnel to the West Bank and Gaza for HAMAS fighters.</p>\n\n<p>Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian �martyrs� have been transferred to the bank account of Hamdan and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Khalid MISHAAL </strong></p>\n\n<p>Mishaal is the chief of HAMAS\'s Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria and heads HAMAS\'s Executive Committee and Special Office. \xa0\xa0 Cells in the military wing based in the West Bank that are under Mishaal\'s control have been implicated in efforts by HAMAS to plan large attacks that would undermine the ""road map"" peace plan.</p>\n\n<p>Mishaal has been responsible for supervising assassination operations, bombings and the killing of Israeli settlers. \xa0 To execute HAMAS military activities, Mishaal maintains a direct link to Gaza-based HAMAS leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi <em>(see </em>below). \xa0 He also provides instructions to other parts of the HAMAS military wing.</p>\n\n<p>Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian martyrs have been transferred to the bank account of Mishaal and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Musa Abu MARZOUK </strong></p>\n\n<p>Musa Abu Marzouk is the Deputy Chief of HAMAS\'s Political Bureau based in Damascus, Syria. \xa0 His activities include directing and coordinating terrorist acts by HAMAS against soldiers and civilians in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. \xa0\xa0 Marzouk maintains relationships with other terrorist organizations.</p>\n\n<p>The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001 based on its support of HAMAS, received start-up funding and instructions from Marzouk. \xa0 Marzouk is implicated in receiving financing for HAMAS terrorist attacks, funds that have been used to mobilize military activity inside Israel and the West Bank/Gaza.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abdel Aziz RANTISI </strong></p>\n\n<p>Rantisi is part of the HAMAS leadership in Gaza, operating directly under HAMAS Leader Shaykh Yassin <em>(see </em>above) with whom he maintains a direct line of communication for the coordination of military operations. \xa0 Mishaal <em>(see </em>above) has also issued orders for HAMAS terrorist activities through R</p>\n\n<p>antisi.</p>\n\n<p>In October of 2002, Rantisi was reported in Al-Hayat as personally claiming responsibility for the assassination of a Palestinian Authority Police Colonel. \xa0 In December 2002, he was calling for Iraq to prepare thousands of martyrdom cells to fight the United States and its allies in the event of war.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>HAMAS Fundraising </u></strong></p>\n\n<p>HAMAS raises tens of millions or dollars per year throughout the world using charitable fundraising as cover. \xa0 While HAMAS may provide money for legitimate charitable work, this work is a primary recruiting tool for the organization\'s militant causes. \xa0 HAMAS relies on donations from Palestinian expatriates around the world and private benefactors located in moderate Arab states, Western Europe and North America. \xa0 HAMAS uses a web of charities to facilitate funding and to funnel money. \xa0 Charitable donations to non-governmental organizations are commingled, moved between charities in ways that hide the money trail, and then often diverted or siphoned to support terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>The funds pouring into HAMAS coffers directly undermine the Middle East peace process. \xa0 These funds allow the group to continue to foment violence, strengthen its terrorist infrastructure, and undermine responsible leadership.</p>\n\n<p>The political leadership of HAMAS directs its terrorist networks just as they oversee their other activities. \xa0 HAMAS leader Yassin confirms this relationship, stating to al-Sharq al-Awsat on August 12, 2002: ""When we make decisions on the political level and convey them to the military wing, it abides by it normally.� \xa0 The intensity of this relationship is reflected in Yassin\'s words quoted by Reuters on May 12, 1998:</p>\n\n<p>We can not separate the wing from the body. \xa0 If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. \xa0 HAMAS is one body.</p>\n\n<p>A report issued by Human Rights Watch has also noted

140	Darya	PMC Bank	company	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2671AK	"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s fraud-hit PMC Bank has approached other banks over a possible merger even as its efforts to recover funds from a big borrower have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the bank’s administrator said in a court filing seen by Reuters.

Authorities started investigating Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) for fraud last year and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of it after detecting financial irregularities. Thousands of PMC depositors have been unable to access their deposits for a year as the RBI has capped withdrawals at 100,000 rupees ($1,359).

PMC has “tried to engage with the major banks of the country to request for a merger”, the bank’s administrator said in a Sept. 10 filing at the Delhi High Court, without identifying the banks or giving other details.

The bulk of PMC’s loan book was found to be disbursed to one Indian real estate company, HDIL, and an RBI-appointed administrator, Jai Bhagwan Bhoria, has been trying to recover the dues in a bid to rescue the lender. Authorities have been investigating officials of both PMC and HDIL.

HDIL and its associates owe 69.81 billion rupees ($949 million) to PMC, but at 11.6 billion rupees ($157.56 million), the realisable value of its securities was “grossly insufficient”, Bhoria said in the filing of the case brought forward by two aggrieved PMC depositors.

Other legal processes to sell certain securities have also been hit as courts have not been fully operational during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the filing said.

Bhoria and the RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HDIL, which has denied any wrongdoing, also did not respond.

Set up in 1984, PMC is a regional co-operative lender with 137 branches across six states in India, and its sudden downfall in late September 2019, has left thousands of its depositors struggling.

In his filing, Bhoria said a push to sell an HDIL yacht had also been hit as it was anchored in Sri Lanka and interested bidders had not been able to inspect it due to COVID-19 travel curbs.

Separately, two of HDIL’s aircraft could not be auctioned swiftly as the Mumbai International Airport - where they have been parked - was closed to visitors, the filing said."

(The firm, whose leaked records span 40 years and make up the Panama Papers, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), issued a statement to the ICIJ denying any unlawful activities. In addition, it stated that ties to offshore companies is not an implication of wrongdoing.)

On January 27 Brazil's Federal Police, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash (""Operação Lava Jato""), accused the firm of helping clients create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. Prosecutors alleged that the firm was using real estate company OAS Empreendimentos Imobiliários S/A to help cover up money made in the criminal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Six temporary arrests were made and 16 search warrants were issued. Lawyers representing those arrested denied any wrongdoing or irregularities. FORBES has been unable to reach the firm for comment. Aside from its office in Brazil, the firm also has branches in 40 other cities.

According to the ICIJ, which on Sunday began sharing information on the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca's cofounder Ramón Fonseca, an adviser to Panama's president, ""took a leave of absence as presidential adviser in March after his firm was implicated in the Brazil scandal and ICIJ and its partners began to ask questions about the law firm’s practices.""

At least 29 billionaires and former billionaires have been outed for allegedly having ties to offshore wealth (see story here). No Brazilian billionaires have been named so far. According to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de São Paulo, several current and former Brazilian government officials belonging to almost every political party are allegedly implicated. Among them, João Lyra, a former deputy and once Brazil's richest parliament member according to the ICIJ, was named for not disclosing an offshore holding or Swiss bank account. According to Brazilian law, individuals are allowed to have offshore accounts as long as they are registered in the country for tax purposes. Lyra has not commented on the leak. Idalécio de Castro Rodrigues de Oliveira, a Portuguese business executive accused of allegedly supplying cash used to bribe Eduardo Cunha, the president of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, was also named for creating offshore companies right before the alleged bribe took place. De Oliveira didn't comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.

In addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz Galvão family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo Petrópolis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz Galvão released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.

Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as “Lula” (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and refuses to step down, claiming that she is the victim of a coup attempt by rivals."

De Oliveira didn\'t comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.\n\nIn addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz Galvão family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo Petrópolis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz Galvão released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.\n\nOperation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as “Lula” (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government. Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and refuses to step down, claiming that she is the victim of a coup attempt by rivals.', 'authorsList': ['kblankfeld@gmail.com'], 'description': ""Two months before one of the world's largest data leaks dubbed Panama Papers was made public this Sunday, Brazilian prosecutors accused the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at the center of the leak, of corruption."", 'probability': 0.90991783, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/', 'dateModified': '2016-04-04T20:04:43-04:00', 'datePublished': '2016-04-04T17:12:00-04:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div class=""article-body fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article""><div class=""article-sharing""><ul class=""article-sharing__container""><li class=""article-sharing__item""><a class=""social-icon facebook"" onclick=""window.open(&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkerenblankfeld%2F2016%2F04%2F04%2Flaw-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january%2F&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')"" aria-label=""Share Facebook"" data-ga-track=""Facebook Click""><span class=""screen-reader-text"">Share to Facebook</span><svg class=""fs-icon fs-icon--facebook"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewbox=""0 0 60 60""><path d=""M32.9 49H25V30h-3.9v-6.6H25v-3.9c0-5.4 2.2-8.5 8.5-8.5h5.2v6.6h-3.3c-2.5 0-2.6.9-2.6 2.6v3.3h5.9l-.5 6.5H33v19h-.1z""></path></svg></a></li><li class=""article-sharing__item""><a class=""social-icon twitter"" onclick=""window.open(&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkerenblankfeld%2F2016%2F04%2F04%2Flaw-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january%2F&amp;text=Law%20Firm%20At%20Center%20of%20Panama%20Papers%20Leak%20Was%20Implicated%20In%20Brazil%20Corruption%20Scandal%20In%20January%20via%20%40forbes&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')"" aria-label=""Share Twitter"" data-ga-track=""Twitter Click""><span class=""screen-reader-text"">Share to Twitter</span><svg class=""fs-icon fs-icon--twitter"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewbox=""0 0 60 60""><path d=""M22.2 38.9c-3.4-.3-6.1-1.7-7.5-5.1h3.6c-3.9-1.4-5.6-4.3-5.9-8.4 1.2.6 2.3.7 3.5.7-2.1-1.6-3.6-3.4-3.7-6.1-.1-1.5.5-2.8 1.3-4 4.4 5 9.7 8.3 16.5 8.9v-2.7c.1-1.9.6-3.6 1.9-5.1 2.5-2.8 6.9-3.1 9.8-.7.2.2.5.4.7.6.2.2.4.2.7.2 1.1-.3 2-.9 3-1.4.5-.3 1.1-.6 1.7-1-.4 1.1-.9 2-1.5 2.8-.6.8-1.3 1.6-2.2 2.2 1.6-.2 3.2-.6 4.8-1.1-.3.4-.6.8-.9 1.1l-2.7 2.4c-.1.1-.2.3-.2.4.1 3.3-.6 6.5-1.9 9.6-1.9 4.2-4.7 7.5-8.6 9.9-2.5 1.5-5.2 2.4-8.1 2.9-5.5.8-10.5-.5-15.1-3.3-.1 0-.1-.1-.2-.1h.2c1.1.5 2.2.4 3.3.3 2.3-.2 4.5-.9 6.6-2.1l.9-.6v-.3z""></path></svg></a></li><li class=""article-sharing__item""><a class=""social-icon linkedin"" onclick=""window.open(&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkerenblankfeld%2F2016%2F04%2F04%2Flaw-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january%2F&amp;title=Law%20Firm%20At%20Center%20of%20Panama%20Papers%20Leak%20Was%20Implicated%20In%20Brazil%20Corruption%20Scandal%20In%20January&amp;summary=Two%20months%20before%20one%20of%20the%20world\'s%20largest%20data%20leaks%20dubbed%20Panama%20Papers%20was%20made%20public%20this%20Sunday%2C%20Brazilian%20prosecutors%20accused%20the%20Panama%20law%20firm%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20at%20the%20center%20of%20the%20leak%2C%20of%20corruption.&quot;, \'window\', \'width=400,height=500\')"" aria-label=""Share Linkedin"" data-ga-track=""Linkedin Click""><span class=""screen-reader-text"">Share to Linkedin</span><svg class=""fs-icon fs-icon--linkedin"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewbox=""0 0 60 60""><path d=""M44.9 33.2v11h-6.4V34c0-2.6-.9-4.3-3.2-4.3-1.8 0-2.8 1.2-3.3 2.3-.2.4-.2 1-.2 1.6v10.7h-6.4s.1-17.4 0-19.2h6.4V27.9v-.1c.8-1.3 2.4-3.2 5.8-3.2 4.1 0 7.3 2.7 7.3 8.6zM18.7 15.8c-2.2 0-3.6 1.4-3.6 3.3 0 1.8 1.4 3.3 3.5 3.3 2.2 0 3.6-1.5 3.6-3.3 0-1.9-1.3-3.3-3.5-3.3zm-3.2 28.4h6.4V25h-6.4v19.2z""></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div id=""attachment_518038678"" class=""wp-caption wp-caption-wrap alignnone""> \n <div class=""article-body-image""> \n  <progressive-image class=""dam-image getty size-large wp-image-518038678"" src=""https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/518038678/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"" alt=""Brazil\'s Federal Police accused Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at center of Panama Papers leak of...

411	Sebastien			https://globalcompliancenews.com/malaysia-extra-territorial-effect-of-new-corporate-liability-for-corruption-offences03092020/	"In brief

The new corporate liability provision under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (“ Section 17A “) has come into force on 1 June 2020. As highlighted in our earlier client alert (see Link), a company may be held criminally liable under this new provision for acts of bribery committed by its directors, employees or other associated persons. The only defence available is for the company to prove that it has put in place adequate procedures designed to prevent these corrupt acts.

This new corporate liability provision applies not only to Malaysian companies, but also to foreign companies with businesses in Malaysia.

Impact on Foreign Companies

The new Section 17A applies to all foreign companies and partnerships which carry on businesses in Malaysia. Although the Act is silent as to what amounts to “carrying out business” in Malaysia, it is likely that a foreign entity will fall within the ambit of Section 17A if it carries on business in Malaysia through an agent or intermediary such as a distributor or reseller and/or through a subsidiary.

The following are examples of two scenarios where a foreign company may be exposed to liability under Section 17A:

Foreign company’s employees or agents pay a bribe in Malaysia

A foreign company may be liable for an offence under Section 17A of the Act if its employees, agents or persons associated with it bribes or attempts to give a bribe in Malaysia to obtain or retain business or business advantage for the company.

Foreign company’s subsidiary pays a bribe in Malaysia

A foreign company may also be liable if its subsidiary bribes or attempts to give a bribe in Malaysia to obtain or retain business or business advantage. This is illustrated in the first prosecution under the UK Bribery Act 2020 in the case of R v Sweett Group plc (“ Sweett “) (unreported)(2015), whereby a subsidiary of Sweett paid a bribe in the Middle East to secure a project. Notwithstanding that, the subsidiary engaged in the bribery without the involvement or knowledge of its parent company and that the contract was awarded to the subsidiary, the judge took into account the fact that the subsidiary was not autonomous but was effectively operated by Sweett as a division in the Middle East.

For completeness, we wish to highlight that liability may not accrue through simple corporate ownership or investment, or through the payment of dividends or provision of loans by a subsidiary to its parents. The degree of control of the Malaysian subsidiary will be a relevant factor whether liability is extended to a foreign holding company under Section 17A.

Action to consider

The penalties arising from liability under Section 17A is a fine not less than 10 times the value of the bribe or MYR 1 million (whichever is higher) and/or imprisonment of a term not exceeding 20 years.

In light of this, foreign companies with businesses in Malaysia should take steps to assess their risk and to consider putting in place the required adequate procedures which is the only defence available for corporates arising from liability under Section 17A. Please refer to our previous client alert here on how to comply with the requisite adequate procedures under Section 17A."

Canberk		Malaysia: Extra Territorial Effect of New Corporate Liability for Corruption Offences
81	Canberk	Danske Bank	Company	https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history	"The Russian-speaking caller refused to give a name but the threat was explicit: “Do you really feel you can walk home safely at night?”

It was 2013 and officers at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank were beginning to realise they had taken on some very unpleasant customers. After a tipoff, a member of staff had travelled to Moscow and started asking questions. The team was trying to trace the identity of people hiding behind anonymous corporate vehicles, which had opened accounts and were now using them to transfer huge sums of money. That was when its staff began to receive anonymous threats. “This bank will sink,” one caller warned.

Today, Danske is still very much in business, but its chief executive, Thomas Borgen, has resigned. He fell on his sword after a report produced by lawyers for his board, published on Wednesday, revealed the full extent of problems at the Estonian branch. It had thousands of suspicious customers, responsible for €200bn (£180bn) of transactions over a nine-year period. The realisation is dawning that what has been uncovered is probably the largest ever money-laundering scandal in history.

“Europe has a major money-laundering problem,” said anti-corruption expert Nienke Palstra, at campaign group Global Witness. “Until we see senior executives held fully accountable for criminal wrongdoing and serious fines for the banks involved, this kind of scandal will continue for decades to come.”

Regulators and law enforcement agencies are slowly beginning to respond. Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed it is investigating an anonymous corporate vehicle linked to the scandal. For the moment, this is a civil, not a criminal case, which means no individuals will be prosecuted.

The US is taking an interest. The justice department, the treasury department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US stock markets, are reportedly involved.

Denmark’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, has reopened an investigation that it had closed in May. Its first inquiry resulted in a reprimand, but no fine. Now the authority will look at whether management should face legal action. Its head, Jesper Berg, told the Financial Times: “It’s easy to understand that there’s a lot of public uproar. It’s a continuation of the financial crisis. There’s this sense of unmet consequences for the financial sector.”

Before being rewarded with the top job, Borgen had been responsible for Estonia as Danske’s head of international operations from 2009-12. The chief executive, in his resignation statement, said the report concluded he had “lived up” to his legal obligations. There are concerns, however, that the person at the helm during a catastrophic failure of the bank’s internal controls is not leaving immediately. Borgen is being retained until a replacement is found and, as part of his contract, he is entitled to collect a year’s pay.

Many questions remain unanswered. Even as the number of law enforcement agencies trying to tackle the Danske problem grows, doubts are mounting about their ability to bring prosecutions. Money laundering is a transnational crime. The Danske scandal involves 32 currencies, companies from Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands and the Seychelles. Customers of the Estonian branch have been traced to Russia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

One scheme run through the branch reportedly involved Azerbaijan’s ruling elite, and a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) fund used to pay European politicians and lobbyists.

“Money laundering is a globalised industry and if you operate on a domestic basis you might as well not bother,” said Tom Keatinge, the director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. A former investment banker, Keatinge worked at JP Morgan for 20 years before turning his attention to combating fraud. “The borders are immaterial to you when you are structuring these transactions, whereas the borders are not immaterial for the cops who are trying to chase you.”

Last week, the European commission put forward proposals to create the EU’s first genuine cross-border anti-money laundering force. The European Banking Authority will see its relevant investigations team increased from two people to 10, and the agency is to be handed the power to intervene where it believes national regulators are failing. But its mandate is limited to taking action against banks – it cannot prosecute their criminal customers.

Neither this week’s 87-page report, produced for Danske by an independent law firm, Bruun and Hjejle, nor a 19-page memorandum by the Danish FSA outlining Danske’s failings in May, have confirmed the names of any of the bank’s suspicious clients. Five years after staff in Estonia began raising the alarm, the only revelations in this area have come from investigative reporters.

The Bruun and Hjejle report makes a glancing reference to the most eye-catching name: the Putin family. It confirms that in December 2013, a whistleblower’s account was sent to a member of Danske’s executive board. The whistleblower named a UK registered company with an account at Danske whose beneficial owners were suspected to include “the Putin family and the FSB”.

Bruun and Hjejle referenced reporting by the Danish newspaper Berlingske, which last year named Igor Putin, a businessman and cousin of the Russian president, and a number of his associates, as the individuals suspected by Danske staff of having transacted money through its Estonian accounts. Putin did not respond to a request for comment from Berlingske.

The transactions centred on a UK-registered company called Lantana Trade LLP. England’s limited liability partnerships are notoriously popular for money laundering, because the information they are obliged to disclose is minimal. Companies House lists 50,000 active LLPs.

Lantana had filed accounts claiming to be dormant, according to the Danish FSA report from May. But Danske staff noticed in the summer of 2012 that it had an extensive history of transactions and a credit balance of nearly $1m. The alarm was raised with managers, but instead of closing the account, they allowed Lantana to remain a client until September 2013.

The NCA will not name the company it is investigating. The only detail given is that it is an LLP. In a statement, the agency did acknowledge the role often played by English companies in illegal schemes. “The threat posed by the use of UK company structures as a route for money laundering is widely recognised and the NCA is working with partners across government to restrict the ability of criminals to use them in this way.”

The government says it is considering how to bolster the ability of the Companies House team to check the information provided by entities on its register. But for Keatinge, information gathering is not enough. “We know that supervision doesn’t get the bad guys,” he said. “It’s investigation that gets the bad guys.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605050834208-421aab2f07a3411a', 'domain': 'theguardian.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history', 'author': 'Juliette Garside', 'images': ['https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0826ff40d0e84fe396ff86848dbe6f7596fdb4/0_435_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04bdd6d376edc331511414696576d63e', 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0826ff40d0e84fe396ff86848dbe6f7596fdb4/0_435_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fccad12145bba5a61042a2840a6b8e30'], 'headline': 'Is money-laundering scandal at Danske Bank the largest in history?', 'mainImage': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0826ff40d0e84fe396ff86848dbe6f7596fdb4/0_435_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0051239b84d05aae4876acaeae2536d6', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'The Russian-speaking caller refused to give a name but the threat was explicit: “Do you really feel you can walk home safely at night?”\n\nIt was 2013 and officers at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank were beginning to realise they had taken on some very unpleasant customers.

300	Canberk	Bernard Ebbers	Person	https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/bernard-ebbers-ex-ceo-convicted-in-worldcom-scandal-dies.html	"The former chief of WorldCom, convicted in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history, died just over a month after his early release from prison. Bernard Ebbers was 78.

The Canadian-born former telecommunications executive died Sunday in Brookhaven, Mississippi, surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

WorldCom Inc. collapsed and went into bankruptcy in 2002, following revelations of an $11 billion accounting fraud that included pressure by top executives on subordinates to inflate numbers to make the company seem more profitable. The collapse caused losses to stockholders, including those who had invested through retirement plans.

Ebbers was convicted in New York in 2005 on securities fraud and other charges and received a 25-year sentence. A federal appeals court judge who upheld Ebbers' conviction in 2006 wrote that WorldCom's fraudulent accounting practices were ""specifically intended to create a false picture of profitability even for professional analysts that, in Ebbers' case, was motivated by his personal financial circumstances.""

Before establishing himself in telecommunications, Ebbers had a diverse career that started in sports. He received a basketball scholarship at Mississippi College, where he majored in physical education. After graduating, he coached high school teams for a year before investing in a hotel; he eventually amassed a chain of Best Westerns in Mississippi and Texas, as well as a car dealership in Columbia, Mississippi.

Following the advice of friends and knowing little about the phone business, he invested in a small long-distance company, LDDS, in 1983. He eventually took over the day-to-day operations and bought up competitors, transforming LDDS — which was later renamed WorldCom, based in Clinton, Mississippi — into the fourth-largest long-distance company by 1996.

He was considered to be a ""no-nonsense"" man with a brash attitude who preferred jeans to a suit. One analyst cited in an early profile in the late nineties said Bernie Ebbers was ""the telephone equivalent of Bill Gates.""

By the time of its collapse over its accounting fraud scandal in 2002, WorldCom was the nation's second-largest long-distance business. Ebbers left that year and following his conviction, was imprisoned from September 2006 until Dec. 21, when he was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.

In the meantime, WorldCom reemerged as MCI, taken over by Verizon, and relocated to Ashburn, Virginia.

U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said late last year that it fell within her discretion to order the early release of Ebbers after a lawyer cited severe medical problems and said that Ebbers had experienced severe weight loss. At over 6 feet tall, he had dropped in weight from above 200 pounds to 147 pounds. Attorney Graham Carner told the judge it was possible his client might not live another 18 months.

Among other ailments, Ebbers had heart disease, Carner said. Ebbers was not in court when Caproni announced her ruling on Dec. 18; his lawyers said he was hospitalized.

""While Mr. Ebbers is physically alive ... his quality of life is gone,"" Carner said in December. ""If he was released today, Mr. Ebbers is not going to be playing tennis or running a business.""

In court papers in September, his lawyers said Ebbers unintentionally bumped into another prisoner while walking in the facility in September of 2017, only to have the prisoner go to Ebbers' open cell later in the day and physically attack him.

The papers said the attack fractured the bones around Ebbers' eyes and caused blunt head trauma and other injuries. They also said Ebbers was put into solitary confinement because his ""severely limited eyesight"" made him unable to identify the attacker.

In July 2019, one of Ebbers' daughters submitted a request that her father receive compassionate release from a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Court papers say a Bureau of Prisons official denied that request in August. The family statement said that the Bureau of Prisons ""had no diagnosis or treatment plan in place"" and Ebbers experienced a ""rapid decline"" in October, followed by multiple hospitalizations in November and December.

While prosecutors agreed that Ebbers' health had deteriorated in prison, they opposed an early release. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Cowley told the judge that such a move would send ""a terrible message to the rule of law"" because it would cut Ebbers' sentence in half.

The family statement acknowledged resistance to Ebbers' early release from victims of WorldCom's collapse, but said that many victims also expressed their support.

""Many stockholders and employees lost their investments in the fall of WorldCom. Many of our friends — and many in our family — did too,"" the statement read. ""Thankfully, Judge Caproni agreed with us — keeping Dad in prison, especially in his unexplained and undiagnosed deteriorated condition, would not bring back anyone's investments.""

The family said they would pray for the victims. The statement, which repeatedly praised Caproni, said family members plan to eventually advocate for others ""who are deserving of compassionate release to their families."""

346	Karl			https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sanctions-moneylaundering-idUSKCN12B2GW	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States blacklisted four men and their companies based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, for purported ties to an organization accused of laundering money for drug traffickers and Chinese, Colombian and Mexican crime groups.

Among them was Pakistani national Obaid Khanani, whose father Altaf Khanani was arrested by U.S. authorities in September 2015 and accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of laundering billions of dollars for the Taliban and other groups.

The department said in a statement that Obaid Khanani, 29, continued to help lead his father’s money laundering organization after the arrest. Altaf Khanani is set to be tried on money laundering charges in Miami this month, according to federal court records.

Another man on the list, Hozaifa Khanani, also 29, is Altaf Khanani’s nephew and was involved in real estate investments on behalf of his uncle’s organization, the Treasury Department said. Muhammad Javed Khanani, Altaf Khanani’s brother, was “heavily involved in laundering criminal proceeds via money service businesses” Treasury said. It said a fourth man, Atif Polani, helped move funds on behalf of Khanani’s organization.

The sanctions block any assets the men or companies might have had in the United States, and bars Americans from dealing with them.

“Treasury remains committed to combating illicit money laundering networks around the world and today’s action is the result of close coordination with our partners in the United Arab Emirates,” said John E. Smith, acting director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which imposes sanctions.

The department also blacklisted several businesses based in Pakistan and Dubai for either being owned by the men or being linked to money laundering."

The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a new tool to detect fraudulent activity and better understand how it happens across the payments industry.

The FraudClassifier model is a set of tools and materials that create a more consistent way to classify fraud. It was developed by the Fraud Definitions Work Group.

According to the U.S. central bank, the tool will help organizations classify fraud independently of payment type, payment channel or other payment characteristics.

Payment fraud typically involves the use of stolen credentials or the exploitation of a security vulnerability in credit and debit card networks, including non-prepaid and prepaid debit card networks, the automated clearinghouse transfer system, and the check clearing system.

The overall rate of payments fraud, by value, has risen in the U.S. in recent years. And as the number of payments has risen, so too has the likelihood that a payment is fraudulent. Still, in 2018, payments fraud remained rare and represented just a fraction -- 1 percent -- of the total value of all payments.

The new tool unveiled by the Fed presents a series of questions to users, starting with who initiated the payment to determine whether it was an authorized or unauthorized user."

126	Canberk	ACI Worldwide	Company	https://fintech-bulletin.com/aci-worldwide-showcases-new-machine-learning-kit-for-fraud-management/	"Payments technology provider ACI Worldwide has debuted its new Incremental Learning technology – a new approach to machine learning that it hopes will enhance fraud protection for merchants, financial institutions and their customers.

ACI has filed a patent application for its ‘Incremental Learning’ technology, which is being implemented in machine learning models within ACI’s fraud prevention solutions. This includes Proactive Risk Manager, which delivers enterprise fraud management capabilities for financial institutions and intermediaries, and ACI ReD Shield, which underpins ACI’s secure eCommerce and merchant fraud management capabilities.

ACI claims it’s Incremental Learning’ technology represents ‘a significant advancement’ over current machine learning models that need to be retrained as fraud patterns change. Incremental Learning models are able ‘to think for themselves’ and make small adjustments on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain relevant, even as fraudsters and genuine consumers change their behaviours, it says.

A series of tests, carried out over 13-months on data from three major retail customers, revealed that while traditionally trained models began to degrade after three months, ACI’s incremental models maintained their performance over the full period of the test.

“As fraudsters become more sophisticated, we need to continuously advance our models to beat them at their own game,” said Jimmy Hennessy, director of Data Science, ACI Worldwide. “Our global data science team has created a game-changing piece of machine learning technology that can be seamlessly integrated and future-proofs the precision and operational efficiency for over 5,000 institutions protected by our solutions today.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605094597421-2eeac366f4a43991', 'domain': 'fintech-bulletin.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://fintech-bulletin.com/aci-worldwide-showcases-new-machine-learning-kit-for-fraud-management/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://fintech-bulletin.com/aci-worldwide-showcases-new-machine-learning-kit-for-fraud-management/', 'images': ['https://fintech-bulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/christian-dubovan-Y_x747Yshlw-unsplash-678x381.jpg'], 'headline': 'ACI Worldwide showcases new machine learning kit for fraud management', 'mainImage': 'https://fintech-bulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/christian-dubovan-Y_x747Yshlw-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Payments technology provider ACI Worldwide has debuted its new Incremental Learning technology – a new approach to machine learning that it hopes will enhance fraud protection for merchants, financial institutions and their customers.\n\nACI has filed a patent application for its ‘Incremental Learning’ technology, which is being implemented in machine learning models within ACI’s fraud prevention solutions.

279	Sebastien	Enrique Peña Nieto	individual	https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/08/pena-nieto-mexico-pri-ayotzinapa	"Ayotzinapa: Debunking the “Historic Truth”

On July 7, the attorney general’s office announced that the University of Innsbruck — a collaborating institute in the investigation into the 2014 kidnapping and disappearance of forty-three students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teaching College — had identified the remains of one of the bodies. Crucially, the remains were not found where the Peña Nieto government had insisted the killings occurred but nearly a kilometer away, in a ravine known as the Barranca de la Carnicería.

Ayotzinapa marked the beginning of the end for Peña Nieto, not least because his government insisted on pushing a version of events, famously referred to as the “ historic truth,” that was clearly self-serving. In its version, the students were apprehended by local police in the town of Iguala, turned over to the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos, and killed and burned in a garbage dump in the nearby town of Cocula. But this so-called “historic truth” had always been hotly contested, not least by the families of the victims, and when an international team of experts known as the GIEI got too hot under the collar for the government with its own investigation, it was bounced out of the country in 2016.

On July 10, extradition proceedings were initiated for Tomás Zerón, the former head of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) who had been instrumental in formulating the “historic truth,” on charges of torture, forced disappearance, altering a crime scene, and the loss and concealment of proof in the case. Zerón had fled to Canada in March.

Meanwhile, new evidence based on fresh witness testimony alleges what the Peña administration always strenuously denied: that the army — specifically the 27th and 41st Battalions — was intimately involved in the detention of the students on the fateful night of September 26. Not only that, but a number of the members of these battalions were to have been directly on the payroll of the Guerreros Unidos in order to allow the transport of drugs, arms, and money throughout the region, as well as participating in the disappearance of the forty-three students.

In fact, it is suspected that one of the main reasons the army got involved in the first place was that the students had inadvertently seized a pair of buses that contained a shipment of heroin worth two million dollars.

These accusations put President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) in a delicate spot. From the outset of his administration, he has leaned on the armed forces for everything from the construction of the new Mexico City airport to the transport of gasoline to, recently, sending the navy to seize control of the nation’s ports in a bid to fight corruption there.

Historically answerable only to a series of complicit presidents, the Mexican army is among the most hermetic of institutions, with its own court system and a secretary of defense who has always been an active-duty soldier. Whether AMLO will be able to pry it open to allow the corruption in its own ranks to be investigated will be a stiff test for his resolve.

Most urgently, it is Enrique Peña Nieto who is feeling the heat. On July 20, he celebrated his 54th birthday in seclusion, without the fanfare and hoopla of previous years. It’s not without irony that one hopes he enjoyed it. His coming year stands to be significantly less pleasant than the last."

249	Sebastien	Umar Akmal	individual	https://www.sportsmax.tv/index.php/cricket/cricket-international/item/61485-umar-akmal-banned-for-three-years-from-all-forms-of-cricket	"Umar Akmal has been banned from all forms of cricket for three years, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed.

The batsman faced a hearing in Lahore on Monday over two alleged breaches of the PCB's anti-corruption code.

The 29-year-old was accused of ""failing to disclose to the PCB vigilance and security department (without unnecessary delay) full details of any approaches or invitations received by the participant to engage in corrupt conduct under this anti-corruption code"".

Akmal, who was provisionally suspended on February 20, was facing a maximum of a lifetime ban if found guilty.

107	Darya	Lamine Diack	individual	https://www.france24.com/en/20200915-former-global-athletics-boss-lamine-diack-faces-judgement-day	"The verdicts in the corruption trial of former global athletics chief Lamine Diack, his son and four others will be handed down in a Paris court on Wednesday.

The older Diack, an 87-year-old Senegalese, who was in charge of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now renamed World Athletics, between 1999 and 2015, is charged with ""giving and receiving bribes"", ""breach of trust"" and ""organised money laundering"".

The prosecution alleged that Diack obtained $1.5 million of Russian funds in exchange for the IAAF's anti-doping arm covering up or delaying offences by 23 Russians to allow them to compete in the 2012 London Olympics and the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow.

Prosecutors have called for Diack to serve four years in prison and be fined up to 500,000 euros ($560,000).

Diack told the court it was his decision to delay bans after the athletes failed tests in 2011, but he denied knowing that officials from the body had directly or indirectly asked those athletes for hundreds of thousands of euros to hush up their cases.

He said he was acting to safeguard ""the financial health of the IAAF"" because the federation was negotiating major sponsorship contracts with Russian bank VTB and a Russian broadcaster at the time.

Diack, who was decorated in the Kremlin in late 2011, denied taking Russian funds to finance the successful campaign by Macky Sall for the Senegal presidency.

His son Papa Massata Diack, who worked as a marketing consultant to the IAAF, remains in Senegal, which refuses to extradite him. He has been tried in absentia on charges including corruption and money laundering.

In a press conference in Senegal's capital Dakar on Monday, Papa Massata, who is 55, declared himself ""innocent"" and argued that the French court had no jurisdiction.

He said he was not a French resident and that his companies are registered in his native Senegal.

Senegalese authorities are conducting their own investigation and he is facing similar charges to the ones filed in France.

Papa Massata accused British authorities of being behind the charges -- which he termed ""the biggest lie in the history of world sport"" -- in a bid to secure the IAAF presidency.

Sebastian Coe, who took over from Lamine Diack, is British and a double Olympic gold medallist at 1,500 metres.

- 'In the evening of his life' -

The court has heard that World Athletics is claiming 41.2 million euros compensation from the Diacks for loss of sponsorship.

Prosecutors are also seeking prison sentences for the former head of anti-doping at the IAAF, Gabriel Dolle, lawyer Habib Cisse who was Lamine Diack's advisor, as well as two Russian officials tried in their absence, the former president of the national athletics federation Valentin Balakhnichev and the former coach Alexei Melnikov.

Diack gave often inaudible and confused testimony. One of his lawyers, William Bourdon, asked that the judges ""do not take a decision that stops him from dying with dignity, surrounded by his loved ones, on his native land"".

The prosecution asked the court to punish a ""huge breach of probity that has caused worldwide damage"", even if Diack is ""in the evening of his life"".

The verdict will not mark the end of the Diacks' dealings with the French justice system. The father, a former International Olympic Committee member, and son are subjects of a second investigation on suspicions of corruption in the allocation of the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the postponed 2020 Games to Tokyo.

210	Darya	Endo International Plc	company	https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2020/06/11/571849.htm	"New York state filed civil charges on Wednesday accusing Endo International Plc of insurance fraud for misrepresenting the safety and efficacy of its opioid drugs, adding fuel to the nation’s opioid crisis.

Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges brought by New York’s Department of Financial Services are the second in that regulator’s probe into the opioid industry, following similar charges against Mallinckrodt Plc on April 21.

New York said Endo, which made 18.4% of opioids distributed from 2006 to 2014 in the state, downplayed the risks of addiction and abuse of opioids such as its Opana ER, giving patients greater comfort about using them to relieve pain.

It also said Endo knew it was contributing to a “massive” surge in opioid prescriptions, leading to payments of fraudulent insurance claims on medically unnecessary prescriptions.

“All these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Their greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable.”

Endo removed a reformulated Opana ER from the market in July 2017 after a request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

New York charged Endo with violating two state insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Its shares closed down 66.5 cents, or 14.7%, at $3.845 on the Nasdaq, with most of the decline in late trading after the charges were announced.

The company is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Endo said in a recent regulatory filing it faced more than 3,200 opioid-related lawsuits, mainly by cities, counties and other municipalities.

The financial services department ordered Endo to attend an Oct. 26 hearing at its offices in Albany, New York."

221	Shakshi	Santos Isidro RIVERA MARADIAGA	Individual	https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/us-treasury-names-names-sort-of-in-honduras-case/	"The Honduras government, working closely with US authorities, has cracked down on one of Honduras’ largest drug transport organizations, the Cachiros, seizing properties and businesses and in the process painting a picture of a group whose reach may extend to Honduras’ political and possibly its financial elite.

Honduras police and military have identified 61 properties, 4 commercial establishments, and 24 vehicles in two provinces for seizure, as well as 64 dollar and lempira bank accounts to be frozen at the US Treasury Department’s behest, La Prensa reported.

The US Treasury estimated the value of the assets at $500 million, the newspaper said.

In a statement, the Treasury said the Cachiros is headed by Javier and Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, and its members include their father, Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona, mother, Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez, sister, Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga, and brother, Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga. They do not face charges in Honduras and no formal indictment has been released in the United States.

As opposed to its July 1 statement, in which it named the group as “specially designated narcotics traffickers” without providing details, the Treasury this time identified several companies the group controls, among them a mining operation, a cattle ranch, an African Palm oil processor and a zoo.

An anonymous Treasury source told El Heraldo that there were “dozens” of companies and proxies laundering money for the organization.

The money comes from the group’s lucrative drug trafficking business, which the Treasury detailed in its statement.

“Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel,” the Treasury said. “Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.”

InSight Crime Analysis

If you look at the organizational chart provided by the Treasury (see below, or for complete version see attachment), you might mistake this group for a small, rural band of gangsters. But this organization has deep contacts in the country’s elite that keep their money safe and the judicial authorities at bay. It also has a distribution network that stretches into three countries.

At least part of their reach came to light in a cable released by Wikileaks in which outgoing Ambassador Charles Ford spoke candidly about then President Manuel Zelaya. In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups “have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own” to a high level post in the Security Ministry.

One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros’ candidate for the ministry job.

The Treasury also does not mention the family’s possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros.
The club counts Banco Continental — a company managed by one of the country’s wealthiest families — as one of its other sponsors.

The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams.

The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south.

However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala – Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime’s estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province.

The Cachiros are the second large organization from Honduras that the US Treasury has outed in recent months. The other is led by Jose Miguel “Chepe” Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after the US added him to the same list the Cachiros made in July.

As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged. The head of the Senate’s banking committee called on banks to stop doing business with money launderers; a frontrunner in November’s presidential elections said all candidates should “abstain from using dirty money.”

But sincerity is in short supply in Honduras. Santos Isidro Rivera was arrested briefly earlier this year on weapons charges but released. Leonel was arrested in 2011, but also released.

The Honduran state has largely collapsed, leaving a rich stew of corruption and drug trafficking, which is now boiling over. Witness the fact that the Cachiros have a road construction business, the perfect way to feed corrupt politicians and launder illicit proceeds at the same time.

Drug traffickers still appear to fear the United States, especially the prospect of extradition, which the Honduras government recently green-lighted. However, only one person, who was not a Honduran, has been extradited since, and while the United States is pressuring the Honduran government to start capturing and extraditing local suspects, the subject appears to be too sensitive, especially with presidential elections coming.

To be sure, the United States, despite providing millions in support for the security and judicial authorities in Honduras, seems to have run out of ways to pressure the Honduran state to reform its own institutions and to take action on its own. And while efforts such as the move to tackle the Cachiros are an important first step, they came at the behest of a powerful outsider, not a reform-minded, courageous Honduran seeking to change the direction of this nation.

They do not face charges in Honduras and no formal indictment has been released in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to its <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20130531.aspx"">July 1 statement</a>, in which it named the group as “specially designated narcotics traffickers” without providing details, the Treasury this time identified several companies the group controls, among them a mining operation, a cattle ranch, an African Palm oil processor and a zoo.</p>\n\n<p>An <a href=""https://elheraldo.hn/Secciones-Principales/Pais/Hay-decenas-de-lavadores-y-testaferros-ligados-a-Los-Cachiros"">anonymous Treasury source told El Heraldo</a>\xa0that there were “dozens” of companies and proxies laundering money for the organization.</p>\n\n<p>The money comes from the group’s lucrative drug trafficking business, which the Treasury detailed in its statement.</p>\n\n<p>“Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel,” the Treasury said. “Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.”</p>\n\n<h2>InSight Crime Analysis</h2>\n\n<p>If you look at the organizational chart provided by the Treasury (see below, or for complete version see attachment), you might mistake this group for a small, rural band of gangsters. But this organization has deep contacts in the country’s elite that keep their money safe and the judicial authorities at bay. It also has a distribution network that stretches into three countries.</p>\n\n<p>At least part of their reach came to light in a <a href=""https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08TEGUCIGALPA459_a.html"">cable released by Wikileaks</a>\xa0in which outgoing Ambassador Charles Ford spoke candidly about then President Manuel Zelaya. In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups “have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own” to a high level post in the Security Ministry.</p>\n\n<p>One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. <a href=""https://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2006/05/03/hoy/mundo/587460.html"">Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated</a> shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros’ candidate for the ministry job.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury also does not mention the family’s possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros. <br>The club counts Banco Continental — a company managed by one of the country’s wealthiest families — as one of its other sponsors.</p>\n\n<p>The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities <a href=""https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/263104"">arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron</a> last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the <a href=""https://nuevaya.com.ni/2013/04/presentan-nuevas-pruebas-contra-supuesto-narco-del-cartel-del-valle-de-colombia/"">Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala – Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime’s estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province.</p>\n\n<p>The Cachiros are the second large organization from Honduras that the US Treasury has outed in recent months. The other is led by Jose Miguel “Chepe” Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after <a href=""https://www.insightcrime.org/news/briefs/honduras-congressional-hopeful-added-to-us-kingpin-list"">the US added him to the same list</a> the Cachiros made in July.</p>\n\n<p>As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged.

Additional information:

Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman, also known as Abu Jibril, has been a close associate of Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, a.k.a. Hambali (QDi.087). He was Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)'s (QDe.092) primary recruiter and second in command - running JI operations and heading its regional “shura” before his arrest by Malaysian authorities in June 2001. He was also reportedly a financial conduit for Al-Qaida (QDe.004) in the region.

Abdurrahman has been part of the leadership of Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia (KMM, Malaysian Mujahideen Organization), which has close ties to JI and was established in 1995 at a meeting of Afghanistan veterans. KMM leadership has included Abu Bakar Ba’asyir (QDi.217) and Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin.

Abdurrahman was elected deputy leader of the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI) in 2008. MMI was founded, inter alia, by Ba’asyir and chaired by Ifran Suryahadi Awas who was the younger brother of Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman. MMI was associated with the JI organization in Indonesia, which came to be known as Mantiqi II and was headed by Abdullah Anshori (QDi.216). Anshori and Ba’asyir used MMI as a financial conduit to support JI’s goals and to bring together the various like-minded groups within South-East Asia. MMI’s board members included Agus Dwikarna (QDi.111) and other JI members. Abdurrahman also controls Ar-Rahmah Media, a pro-JI video production company.

Abdurrahman and Agus Dwikarna were also part of the leadership of the Laskar Mujahideen and the Laskar Jundullah, two paramilitary organizations established by JI to engage in sectarian conflict in 1999-2001. The former was closely linked to JI and Al-Qaida.

Abdurrahman was deported from Malaysia in May 2004 and taken into custody in Indonesia where he served a five and a half-month sentence for immigration offenses and forgery."

85	Dan	John McAfee	Person	https://time.com/5896775/john-mcafee-arrested-tax-evasion/	"Elusive cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee was arrested in Spain for tax evasion in the U.S., the Justice Department in Washington said.

McAfee is accused of failing to file U.S. tax returns from 2014 to 2018 and hiding assets including real estate, a vehicle and a yacht in the name of others, prosecutors said. An indictment returned in June was unsealed on Tuesday after he was taken into custody. He’s being held pending extradition, the Justice Department said.

He was arrested on Oct. 3 at Barcelona airport while traveling to Istanbul, according to an official at Spain’s national police force, who can’t be identified under internal policies.

U.S. prosecutors claim McAfee earned millions of dollars through the promotion of cryptocurrencies, speaking engagements, consulting jobs and the sale of the rights to his life story for a documentary, but never filed tax returns. Instead, his income was paid into accounts held in the names of others, prosecutors claim. He faces as long as five years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and a year if found guilty of failing to file taxes.

It’s the latest legal complication for the eccentric software mogul, who was a person of interest in a murder in Belize, though not charged with a crime, and last year he was detained in the Dominican Republic for entering the country with a cache of firearms and ammunition. He was also briefly a candidate for president in this year’s U.S. election, ending his run from abroad in March.

The criminal charges were announced just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued McAfee for promoting the sale of cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.

The commission claims McAfee recommended at least seven initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers from at least November 2017 to February 2018 without revealing that he earned more than $23 million to boost them. He’s also accused of denying that he was being paid when asked by investors.

The SEC is seeking to force McAfee to disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, and to prohibit him from taking part in the issuance, purchase or sale of any digital asset securities and unspecified monetary penalties.

McAfee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The commission also accused McAfee of claiming to be an investor or technical advisor, “creating the impression that he had vetted these companies, that they were benefiting from his technical expertise, and that he was willing to invest in the ventures.”

When a blogger exposed that he was being paid, McAfee was still holding “virtually worthless” securities from the offerings he promoted and encouraged investors to buy them — without revealing that they were his own securities and he had paid a third party to recommend them, according to the complaint.

McAfee also engaged in a practice called scalping, in which he accumulated large amounts of digital securities and promoted them on Twitter without disclosing his intention to sell, the SEC said.

McAfee founded his epynonymous software firm in 1987. Intel Corp., seeking to build security features directly into its chips, bought the company for $7.7 billion in 2010, with TPG and Thoma Bravo taking stakes later. In 2016, Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51% stake in the business to TPG for $1.1 billion. The company filed to go public last month.

Department in Washington said.</p>\n\n<p>McAfee is accused of failing to file U.S. tax returns from 2014 to 2018 and hiding assets including real estate, a vehicle and a yacht in the name of others, prosecutors said. An indictment returned in June was unsealed on Tuesday after he was taken into custody. He’s being held pending extradition, the Justice Department said.</p>\n\n<p>He was arrested on Oct. 3 at Barcelona airport while traveling to Istanbul, according to an official at Spain’s national police force, who can’t be identified under internal policies.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. prosecutors claim McAfee earned millions of dollars through the promotion of cryptocurrencies, speaking engagements, consulting jobs and the sale of the rights to his life story for a documentary, but never filed tax returns. Instead, his income was paid into accounts held in the names of others, prosecutors claim. He faces as long as five years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and a year if found guilty of failing to file taxes.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the latest legal complication for the eccentric software mogul, who was a person of interest in a murder in Belize, though not charged with a crime, and last year he was detained in the Dominican Republic for entering the country with a cache of firearms and ammunition. He was also briefly a candidate for president in this year’s U.S. election, ending his run from abroad in March.</p>\n\n<p>The criminal charges were announced just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued McAfee for promoting the sale of cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The commission claims McAfee recommended at least seven initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers from at least November 2017 to February 2018 without revealing that he earned more than $23 million to boost them. He’s also accused of denying that he was being paid when asked by investors.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC is seeking to force McAfee to disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, and to prohibit him from taking part in the issuance, purchase or sale of any digital asset securities and unspecified monetary penalties.</p>\n\n<p>McAfee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The commission also accused McAfee of claiming to be an investor or technical advisor, “creating the impression that he had vetted these companies, that they were benefiting from his technical expertise, and that he was willing to invest in the ventures.”</p>\n\n<p>When a blogger exposed that he was being paid, McAfee was still holding “virtually worthless” securities from the offerings he promoted and encouraged investors to buy them — without revealing that they were his own securities and he had paid a third party to recommend them, according to the complaint.</p>\n\n<p>McAfee also engaged in a practice called scalping, in which he accumulated large amounts of digital securities and promoted them on Twitter without disclosing his intention to sell, the SEC said.</p>\n\n<p>McAfee founded his epynonymous software firm in 1987. Intel Corp., seeking to build security features directly into its chips, bought the company for $7.7 billion in 2010, with TPG and Thoma Bravo taking stakes later. In 2016, Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51% stake in the business to TPG for $1.1 billion. The company filed to go public last month.</p>\n\n<p>–With assistance from Olga Kharif, Thomas Gualtieri and Laura Millan Lombrana.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-10-06T09:55:37.000Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-10-06T09:55:37.000Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	0		Karl		Cybersecurity Pioneer John McAfee Arrested in Spain on U.S. Tax Evasion Charges
383	Sebastien	Augustine Chihuri	individual	https://www.myzimbabwe.co.zw/news/64638-us32-million-chihuris-shady-deals-exposed-state-orders-him-to-explain-how-he-acquired-his-assets.html	"Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a “syndicated criminal mafia” meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Police’s revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;

571 Zengeza Township;

9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);

Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and

431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.

Four vehicles are also listed under assets that need explanation. Two combine harvesters, six tractors, two planters, three motorbikes and a boom spray were found at Chihuri’s farms at Shamva and Darwendale."

Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.</p>\n\n<p>During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.</p>\n\n<p>So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.</p>\n\n<p>Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.</p>\n\n<p>In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a “syndicated criminal mafia” meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Police’s revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.</p>\n\n<p>Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.</p>\n\n<p>Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.</p>\n\n<p>Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.</p>\n\n<p>Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.</p>\n\n<p>ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.</p>\n\n<p>Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.</p>\n\n<p>The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:</p>\n\n<p>Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;</p>\n\n<p>571 Zengeza Township;</p>\n\n<p>9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);</p>\n\n<p>Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and</p>\n\n<p>431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.</p>\n\n<p>Four vehicles are also listed under assets that need explanation. Two combine harvesters, six tractors, two planters, three motorbikes and a boom spray were found at Chihuri’s farms at Shamva and Darwendale.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-05-20T08:43:25+02:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-05-20T08:28:38+02:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	0	court order	Carel		US$32 million: Chihuri’s shady deals exposed, State orders him to explain how he acquired his assets
113	Canberk	Elavon, Featurespace	Company	https://thefintechtimes.com/elavon-featurespace/	"Elavon, the payments provider, today announces a partnership with Featurespace, to help tackle fraud attacks in real-time and simplify the online payments experience for consumers.

With the use of Featurespace’s innovative ARIC™ Platform, Elavon is developing a fraud network to detect fraudulent activity using adaptive behavioural analytics.

Elavon’s fraud network comes as Europe prepares for the second Payments Services Directive (PSD2) that requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to have affect from September 2019. PSD2 will compel processors, merchants and banks to adopt more effective security checks for online payments in order to reduce card fraud in Europe.

According to a report published by the European Central Bank, Card-Not-Present fraud made up 73% of all card fraud in Europe. Two-factor authentication will be compulsory for all eCommerce transactions above €30, unless an acquirer exempts the payment from additional authentication with the issuer.

Elavon’s network detects instances of fraud to help mitigate the need for additional security checks, which can make the online shopping experience more complicated. Research from Elavon’s report, “ Pocket Shoppers: eCommerce on the Move ” found that two-thirds of consumers will abandon an online purchase if the process is too difficult, leading to a higher rate of cart abandonment.

Combining the Featurespace ARIC™ platform and Elavon’s 3DS service enables merchants to use an advanced, layered approach to fraud prevention. The ARIC™ platform uses machine learning transaction monitoring to build individual behavioural profiles for cardholders and merchants in real-time. This system works to detect anomalies and prevent fraud across all payment methods and channels.

Hannah Fitzsimons, EVP and General Manager of Elavon Merchant Services commented: “Elavon is delighted to work with Featurespace to bring top fraud prevention solutions to market to protect merchants and consumers. We are committed to developing the most innovative fraud and security solutions in the payments industry.”

Martina King, CEO of Featurespace said: “1.3 million customers worldwide rely on Elavon to safeguard their businesses. Working together means we will be staying one step ahead of criminals at all times. It is an honour to have been selected to protect Elavon and their clients.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605094421013-304b1b4b59833300', 'domain': 'thefintechtimes.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/elavon-featurespace/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/elavon-featurespace/', 'author': 'Mark Walker', 'images': ['https://thefintechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-18-at-16.37.52.jpg'], 'headline': 'Elavon Partners with Featurespace to Build Fraud Prevention Network', 'mainImage': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-18-at-16.37.52.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Elavon, the payments provider, today announces a partnership with Featurespace, to help tackle fraud attacks in real-time and simplify the online payments experience for consumers.\n\nWith the use of Featurespace’s innovative ARIC™ Platform, Elavon is developing a fraud network to detect fraudulent activity using adaptive behavioural analytics.\n\nElavon’s fraud network comes as Europe prepares for the second Payments Services Directive (PSD2) that requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to have affect from September 2019.

187	Shakshi	Sergey Yevgeniyevich MOSKALENKO	Individual	https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2196.aspx	"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six individuals and four entities linked to the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Today’s actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle in February 2012. Today’s designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasury’s efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.

“The key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothers’ Circle, is exposing the network behind the group’s leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Today’s action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers’ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Targets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev

Vladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Vladislav Leontyev is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking. He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Grigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Igor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Targets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov

In February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.

Artur Badalyan

Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.

Today’s actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle in February 2012. Today’s designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasury’s efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.\n\n“The key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothers’ Circle, is exposing the network behind the group’s leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.\n\nThe Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Today’s action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.\n\nThe Brothers’ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.\n\nToday’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nTargets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev\n\nVladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Vladislav Leontyev is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking. He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:\n\nVadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;\n\nGrigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;\n\nIgor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;\n\nGurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.\n\nTargets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov\n\nIn February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.\n\nArtur Badalyan\n\nArtur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.\n\nFor a chart detailing Treasury actions against the Brothers’ Circle click here.\n\nIdentifying Information:\n\nName: Artur Badalyan\n\na.k.a.: Arthur Badalyan\n\nDOB: 09 Sep 1963\n\nName: Fasten Tourism LLC\n\na.k.a.: Fasten Tours LLC\n\na.k.a.: Fasten Tourism Dubai\n\nAddress: P.O.

9	Carel	Frans Timmermans	Individual	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1732	"The Juncker Commission has made the fight against tax avoidance, money laundering and terrorism financing one of its priorities.

Today, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive enters into force. It strengthens the existing rules and will make the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing more effective. It also improves transparency to prevent tax avoidance. This entry into force comes as discussions with the European Parliament and the Council on extra measures further reinforcing the Directive are already at an advanced stage.

Today the Commission also publishes a report which will support Member State authorities in better addressing money laundering risks in practice. As required by the new directive, the Commission assessed the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of different sectors and financial products. The report published today identifies the areas most at risk and the most widespread techniques used by criminals to launder illicit funds.

Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President said: ""Laundered money is oxygen to crime, terrorism and tax-avoidance. We need to cut off its supply as best we can. Today's stronger rules are a big step forward but we now need quick agreement on the further improvements the Commission proposed last July.""

Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality said: “Terrorists and criminals still find ways to finance their activities and to launder illicit gains back into the economy. The new rules as of today are crucial to closing further loopholes. I urge all Member States to put them in place without delay: lower standards in one country will weaken the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing across the EU. I also call for quick agreement on the further revisions proposed by the Commission following the ""Panama Papers"" to increase transparency of beneficial ownership.""

Strengthening the existing rules

The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering  reinforces the existing rules by introducing the following changes:

reinforcing the risk assessment obligation for banks, lawyers, and accountants;
setting clear transparency requirements about beneficial ownership for companies. This information will be stored in a central register, such as commercial registers, and will be available to national authorities and obliged entities
facilitating cooperation and exchange of information between Financial Intelligence Units from different Member States to identify and follow suspicious transfers of money to prevent and detect crime or terrorist activities;
establishing a coherent policy towards non-EU countries that have deficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules;
reinforcing the sanctioning powers of competent authorities.
In July 2016, the Commission adopted a proposal to further reinforce these EU rules on anti-money laundering to counter terrorist financing and increase transparency about who really owns companies and trusts. The Commission calls on the European Parliament and the Council to finalise this legislative work as soon as possible, so the new rules can enter into force quickly. Building on the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, these new rules will create a robust EU anti-money laundering framework.

Improving the risk assessment across the internal market

The Supranational Risk Assessment Reportis a tool to help Member States identify, analyse and address money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It analyses the risks in the financial and non-financial sector and looks also into newly emerging risks such as virtual currencies or crowdfunding platforms. The report includes:  

an extensive mapping of risks per relevant area and a list of the means more frequently used by criminals to launder money.
recommendations to Member States how to address identified risks appropriately, for example by putting more emphasis on risk analysis or supervisory actions on specific activities.
Finally the Commission also commits to examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units.

Next steps

On the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive

The Member States should have notified the transposition of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive by today, 26 June 2017. The European Commission will now check the state of the transposition and follow up swiftly with Member States in case they have not taken the necessary measures yet.

On the Supranational Risk Assessment Report

The Commission will carry out the necessary actions outlined in the report, including examining options to enhance the operation and cross-border cooperation of Financial Intelligence Units through specific EU rules. It will also engage with Member States to monitor the implementation of the recommendations.

The Commission will continue reviewing the evolution of Anti-Money Laundry/Counter Financing Terrorism risks and will issue a new assessment of those risks at the latest by June 2019 and every two years thereafter.

Background

The new anti-money laundering framework consists of two legal instruments (IP/15/5001): ‘The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive' and ‘the Fund Transfers Regulation', both adopted on 20 May 2015.

In July 2016, the Commission presented a proposal to better counter the financing of terrorism and to ensure increased transparency of financial transactions following the so-called ""Panama Papers"" revelations (IP/16/2380). These amendments aim at ensuring a high level of safeguards for financial flows from high-risk third countries, enhancing the access of Financial Intelligence Units to information, including centralised bank account registers, and tackling terrorist financing risks linked to virtual currencies and pre-paid cards. The proposal is currently in negotiations in the Council and the European Parliament and is expected to be adopted in the course of 2017."

196	Darya	Sebastian Pinera	individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2102MF	"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced legislation on Friday to combat white collar crimes such as insider trading and collusion, the latest in a series of proposals aimed at quelling the demands of continuing protests over inequality.

Pinera shipped several bills to Congress to beef up penalties against colluding to fix prices on sensitive consumer products, while stiffening fines and jail time for financial crimes ranging from fraud to insider trading.

The legislation also provides regulators with more tools to investigate the crimes and establishes new protections for “whistleblowers” in both public and private sectors who come forward with evidence of crimes.

“The immense majority of Chileans want to build a more just, more equal Chile, without abuses or privileges. That’s the message we have heard loud and clear from the people,” Pinera said in a speech at the La Moneda presidential palace.

Price fixing and other financial crimes lie at the heart of recent protests over social and economic injustices in Chile that have left at least 31 dead and wrought billions in damages to business.

Since Chile’s return to democracy in 1990, allegations of price fixing have cropped up in markets for items from chicken to diapers, milk, drugs, asphalt and even gynecological visits, outraging many Chileans, who demand changes to the country’s economic model.

Anger over these abuses appears in graffiti spray-painted on building walls across Santiago, a city of 6 million, and in the signs carried by protesters rebuking such crimes.

“When these bills become law, we will have freer, more transparent markets, more competitive companies, products of higher quality and lower prices,” Pinera said.

Chileans will vote on whether to rewrite the country’s dictatorship-era constitution in April. Many have also called for tougher consumer protections to be worked into a new Magna Carta.

Pinera said on Friday he would soon announce further protections for consumer and worker rights."

168	Wanting	Afterpay	company	https://www.fintechdirect.net/2020/10/14/afterpay-cleared-in-australian-aml-audit/	"Payments firm Afterpay can move on with its life as it has been cleared by the Australian regulator over compliance issues with anti-money laundering (AML) rules.

It was back in June 2019 when Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ordered the appointment of an external auditor to the Tencent-backed firm to examine its compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) Act 2006.

AUSTRAC had identified concerns with the buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm – such as identification and verification of customers; and suspicious matter reporting obligations.

In November last year an independent audit found that the issues arose because Afterpay breached AML laws due to incorrect legal advice about how to comply.

Today (14 October) the regulator says in response to the findings and recommendations identified in the external audit report, Afterpay has “uplifted” its AML/CTF compliance framework and financial crime function, and completed all remediation necessary to ensure compliance.

AUSTRAC has “decided not to undertake further regulatory action”.

But it will continue to work with the Melbourne-based company to ensure its obligations, etc.

This good news for Afterpay follows the positive development in August when it entered into an agreement with NBQ to acquire Pagantis and PMT Technology for €50 million. That gave it a real boost for its European fintech ambitions.

Prior to that, Tencent grabbed a $193.3 million stake in Afterpay. Tencent, famous for its communications platforms Weixin, WeChat and QQ, got a 5% stake.

Afterpay launched in 2015 and like Klarna – another healthy BNPL firm – is doing well. Last month the Australian paytech had a market capitalisation on the ASX of around AU$22 billion ($16 billion)."

152	Shakshi	UN	Organization	https://www.natlawreview.com/article/international-state-corruption-why-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-continues-to-be	"Corruption has severe damaging effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important priorities such as health, education, and infrastructure. As stated by former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, on the passage of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption:

Corruption is an insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets, erodes the quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.

Essentially, if left unchecked, corruption becomes more than just an economic or international development issue, it begins to threaten basic human rights.

One of the primary ways corruption manifests is through bribery and improper uses of official funds. And despite the damage such crimes cause to global development, there are few mechanisms preventing corruption on a cross-boundary or international scale. For example, Transparency International’s new report, Exporting Corruption, found that only 11 major exporting countries – accounting for about a third of world exports – have active or moderate law enforcement against companies bribing abroad in order to gain mining rights, contracts for major construction projects, purchases of planes, and other deals. At the same time, perceptions of corruption have plateaued and even risen in many states in recent years. Additionally, according to the European Commission, global offshore wealth rose to an estimated EUR 7.5 trillion (USD 7.8 trillion) or 10.4% of the global GDP for 2016 alone, which (in an effort to calculate the scale of international tax evasion), for just the EU meant that an estimated EUR 46 billion in revenue was lost to international tax evasion for the same year.

Based on a review of existing national and regional legislation, the only law truly effectively deterring such violations on a larger scale appears to be the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). The FCPA, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1977, was intended to stop corrupt practices wherever they arise, create a level playing field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace. As stated by U.S. Senator Tower in a 1976 Senate Floor Hearing leading up to the passage of the FCPA:

[I]mproper payments to foreign government officials or their intermediaries is indeed a serious problem and one which is not taken lightly by responsible governments. It is also a problem more akin to a disease which deeply troubles proponents of our free enterprise system. We have built an economy in the United States based on vigorous, honest competition where price, quality, and service commingle with demand and supply to regulate economic transactions. Bribery poisons this system by destroying the organisms of mutual trust and voluntary cooperation so essential to the free flow of commerce. This ethical decay must be stopped.

To do so, the FCPA prohibits the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order to obtain a business advantage and requires publicly traded corporations to have certain internal controls in place and make and keep books and records that accurately reflect the transactions of the corporation in order to ensure that funds are used properly and not for any illicit purpose. Because the FCPA applies to both U.S. persons (including U.S. corporations, NYSE corporations, or corporations trading specific types of ADRs acting abroad) and foreign nationals as well as violations that use U.S. mechanisms or occur in part in the United States, the FCPA uniquely stretches to reach international conduct and prevents just the sort of cross-border violations that often stunt international development. U.S. persons, including corporations, cannot simply go abroad to engage in corrupt activities and take advantage of gaps in other countries’ enforcement of bribery and related misconduct.

Additionally, the FCPA is extremely effective in preventing corruption because (1) it has strong sanctions deterring wrongdoing, and (2) whistleblowers from around the world can safely report violations of its provisions under the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) whistleblower program.

First, unlike many other laws that prevent corruption, the FCPA has substantial sanctions for wrongdoers. For each violation of the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA provides that companies may be subject to a fine of up to $2 million USD and individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, may be fined of up to $250,000 and for each violation of its internal controls/recording keeping provisions. In total, the FCPA provides that corporations may be fined up to $25 million USD and individuals may be fined of up to $5 million USD. Violations of either provision may also result in jail time for individuals. Moreover, under 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d), courts can actually impose significantly higher fines, namely, up to twice the benefit that the defendant obtained by making the corrupt payment, and under 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2 the SEC may order the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from FCPA violators, often resulting in massive overall sanctions. For example, to date in 2020, the average sanction for entities for FCPA violations is $293,824,428 USD. These fines, which are largely nominal in other nations, significantly deter corporate corruption. For example, in France, the company Vitol was fined €300,000 for the same international bribery scheme that it was fined $17 million for in the United States.

Second, the FCPA is under the joint jurisdiction of the SEC and Department of Justice, which means that whistleblowers may report violations of the FCPA to the SEC under the SEC’s comprehensive and extremely successful whistleblower program. Corruption, particularly corruption transcending national boundaries, is extremely difficult to detect or prove, particularly when law enforcement is often limited to U.S.-based evidence. Therefore, in order to detect and prove legal violations such as those covered under the FCPA, it is vital to encourage whistleblowers to come forward. Whistleblowers (who are typically “insiders”) are uniquely positioned to bring corruption taking place primarily outside of the U.S. to the attention of U.S. law enforcement. They are also often best positioned to track how a fraud crosses international borders. Lastly, whistleblowers may be exclusively able to access and send evidence of U.S. persons’ wrongdoing occurring abroad to U.S. officials largely stuck in the United States.

It is important to note that this program is mutually beneficial to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are able to submit anonymous tips through to the SEC through attorneys using the SEC’s Form TCR program. If their tips then lead to sanctions over $1 million USD, they may be entitled to between 10 and 30 percent of the monies recovered depending on a variety of factors. Because, as discussed above, the FCPA was designed to combat the “ethical decay of corruption,” FCPA whistleblowers are not only protected by the strict confidentiality and anonymity provisions of the SEC whistleblower program, but may be handsomely compensated for their risk in exposing corruption due to the high sanctions violators often face and the extremely high law enforcement interest of U.S. officials in preventing bribery and associated illegal activities, one of the factors for increasing a whistleblower reward. Arguably, law enforcement interest is the sole motivating factor for the FCPA and therefore, all whistleblowers who provide information that leads to a sanction of $1 million dollars or more should receive the maximum award.

In order to prevent erosion of democratic institutions around the world, the FCPA should be replicated in other nations, particularly in the global north, where wrongdoers are more likely to try and “game” the international system. The United States cannot tackle this issue alone. Additionally, whistleblowers must be encouraged and lauded in the United States and elsewhere so that insiders continue to bravely expose corruption only they can see and track. FCPA whistleblowers have been, and continue to be, vital to ensuring that those who commit fraud face prosecution in the United States and have their ill-gotten gains disgorged. Each successful FCPA case makes it more likely that a would-be fraudster in any part of the world thinks twice before committing bribery and other malfeasance, for fear of legal repercussions brought by the might of the United States government.

As stated by former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, on the passage of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption:\n\nCorruption is an insidious plague that has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets, erodes the quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.\n\nEssentially, if left unchecked, corruption becomes more than just an economic or international development issue, it begins to threaten basic human rights.\n\nOne of the primary ways corruption manifests is through bribery and improper uses of official funds. And despite the damage such crimes cause to global development, there are few mechanisms preventing corruption on a cross-boundary or international scale. For example, Transparency International’s new report, Exporting Corruption, found that only 11 major exporting countries – accounting for about a third of world exports – have active or moderate law enforcement against companies bribing abroad in order to gain mining rights, contracts for major construction projects, purchases of planes, and other deals. At the same time, perceptions of corruption have plateaued and even risen in many states in recent years. Additionally, according to the European Commission, global offshore wealth rose to an estimated EUR 7.5 trillion (USD 7.8 trillion) or 10.4% of the global GDP for 2016 alone, which (in an effort to calculate the scale of international tax evasion), for just the EU meant that an estimated EUR 46 billion in revenue was lost to international tax evasion for the same year.\n\nBased on a review of existing national and regional legislation, the only law truly effectively deterring such violations on a larger scale appears to be the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). The FCPA, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1977, was intended to stop corrupt practices wherever they arise, create a level playing field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace. As stated by U.S. Senator Tower in a 1976 Senate Floor Hearing leading up to the passage of the FCPA:\n\n[I]mproper payments to foreign government officials or their intermediaries is indeed a serious problem and one which is not taken lightly by responsible governments. It is also a problem more akin to a disease which deeply troubles proponents of our free enterprise system. We have built an economy in the United States based on vigorous, honest competition where price, quality, and service commingle with demand and supply to regulate economic transactions. Bribery poisons this system by destroying the organisms of mutual trust and voluntary cooperation so essential to the free flow of commerce. This ethical decay must be stopped.\n\nTo do so, the FCPA prohibits the payment of anything of value to foreign government officials in order to obtain a business advantage and requires publicly traded corporations to have certain internal controls in place and make and keep books and records that accurately reflect the transactions of the corporation in order to ensure that funds are used properly and not for any illicit purpose. Because the FCPA applies to both U.S. persons (including U.S. corporations, NYSE corporations, or corporations trading specific types of ADRs acting abroad) and foreign nationals as well as violations that use U.S. mechanisms or occur in part in the United States, the FCPA uniquely stretches to reach international conduct and prevents just the sort of cross-border violations that often stunt international development. U.S. persons, including corporations, cannot simply go abroad to engage in corrupt activities and take advantage of gaps in other countries’ enforcement of bribery and related misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, the FCPA is extremely effective in preventing corruption because (1) it has strong sanctions deterring wrongdoing, and (2) whistleblowers from around the world can safely report violations of its provisions under the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) whistleblower program.\n\nFirst, unlike many other laws that prevent corruption, the FCPA has substantial sanctions for wrongdoers. For each violation of the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA provides that companies may be subject to a fine of up to $2 million USD and individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, may be fined of up to $250,000 and for each violation of its internal controls/recording keeping provisions. In total, the FCPA provides that corporations may be fined up to $25 million USD and individuals may be fined of up to $5 million USD. Violations of either provision may also result in jail time for individuals. Moreover, under 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d), courts can actually impose significantly higher fines, namely, up to twice the benefit that the defendant obtained by making the corrupt payment, and under 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2 the SEC may order the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from FCPA violators, often resulting in massive overall sanctions. For example, to date in 2020, the average sanction for entities for FCPA violations is $293,824,428 USD. These fines, which are largely nominal in other nations, significantly deter corporate corruption. For example, in France, the company Vitol was fined €300,000 for the same international bribery scheme that it was fined $17 million for in the United States.\n\nSecond, the FCPA is under the joint jurisdiction of the SEC and Department of Justice, which means that whistleblowers may report violations of the FCPA to the SEC under the SEC’s comprehensive and extremely successful whistleblower program. Corruption, particularly corruption transcending national boundaries, is extremely difficult to detect or prove, particularly when law enforcement is often limited to U.S.-based evidence. Therefore, in order to detect and prove legal violations such as those covered under the FCPA, it is vital to encourage whistleblowers to come forward. Whistleblowers (who are typically “insiders”) are uniquely positioned to bring corruption taking place primarily outside of the U.S. to the attention of U.S. law enforcement. They are also often best positioned to track how a fraud crosses international borders. Lastly, whistleblowers may be exclusively able to access and send evidence of U.S. persons’ wrongdoing occurring abroad to U.S. officials largely stuck in the United States.\n\nIt is important to note that this program is mutually beneficial to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are able to submit anonymous tips through to the SEC through attorneys using the SEC’s Form TCR program. If their tips then lead to sanctions over $1 million USD, they may be entitled to between 10 and 30 percent of the monies recovered depending on a variety of factors. Because, as discussed above, the FCPA was designed to combat the “ethical decay of corruption,” FCPA whistleblowers are not only protected by the strict confidentiality and anonymity provisions of the SEC whistleblower program, but may be handsomely compensated for their risk in exposing corruption due to the high sanctions violators often face and the extremely high law enforcement interest of U.S. officials in preventing bribery and associated illegal activities, one of the factors for increasing a whistleblower reward. Arguably, law enforcement interest is the sole motivating factor for the FCPA and therefore, all whistleblowers who provide information that leads to a sanction of $1 million dollars or more should receive the maximum award.\n\nIn order to prevent erosion of democratic institutions around the world, the FCPA should be replicated in other nations, particularly in the global north, where wrongdoers are more likely to try and “game” the international system. The United States cannot tackle this issue alone. Additionally, whistleblowers must be encouraged and lauded in the United States and elsewhere so that insiders continue to bravely expose corruption only they can see and track. FCPA whistleblowers have been, and continue to be, vital to ensuring that those who commit fraud face prosecution in the United States and have their ill-gotten gains disgorged. Each successful FCPA case makes it more likely that a would-be fraudster in any part of the world thinks twice before committing bribery and other malfeasance, for fear of legal repercussions brought by the might of the United States government.\n\nexcellent guide, which is the single best resource on the scope of the FCPA.', 'authorsList': ['Maraya Best'], 'description': 'Corruption has severe damaging effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important priorities such as health, education, and infrastruct', 'probability': 0.8327456, 'canonicalUrl': 'https://www.natlawreview.com/article/international-state-corruption-why-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-continues-to-be', 'datePublished': '2020-10-27T00:00:00', 'articleBodyRaw': '<div id=""normal-wrapper"">\n\n            <div class=""view view-content-meta view-id-content_meta view-display-id-block_2 view-dom-id-8969a3157c358deb59111cf87f1326a4"">\n        \n  \n  \n      <div class=""view-content"">\n        <div class=""views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last"">\n      \n  <div class=""views-field views-field-created"">        <span class=""field-content"">Tuesday, October 27, 2020</span>  </div>  </div>\n    </div>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n</div><p>Corruption has severe damaging effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important priorities such as health, education, and infrastructure.

116	Sebastien	Odebrecht	company	https://www.france24.com/en/20190618-brazil-debt-construction-odebrecht-bankruptcy-peru-dominican-republic-lula-da-silva	"Company lawyers filed a request with the bankruptcy court in Sao Paulo to negotiate debts of more than $20 billion dollars, officials quoted by Brazilian media said.

The demand makes it the biggest debt protection process in Brazilian history, exceeding that of telecom provider Oi in 2016.

The procedure allows Odebrecht to maintain its business activities while giving it six months to settle with its creditors.

Among the major creditors of Odebrecht are the public banks Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, Banco de Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal.

EN NW PKG BRAZIL ODEBRECHT CORRUPTION

The request for bankruptcy protection was precipitated by the suspension of the sale of the group's interest in Braskem -- a joint petrochemical company formed with Petrobras -- to Dutch firm LyondellBasell, and the May filing for bankruptcy protection by Odebrecht Atvos, the second-largest ethanol producer in the country.

Odebrecht, which is currently in the process of selling assets to limit its debt, has thus found itself in an even more precarious position vis-a-vis its creditors.

Founded in 1944, Odebrecht S.A. has long been one of Brazil 's economic giants, building everything from the Miami Heat basketball arena to a hydroelectric dam in Angola.

Often described as a construction company, Odebrecht has also been a major player in engineering, agriculture and petrochemical production.

But now, Odebrecht is at the centre of Latin America's biggest corruption scandal that has rocked governments and political parties in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and other countries, sending former presidents and senior officials to jail.

Once one of the most influential people in Brazil, company chief Marcelo Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in the scandal -- although he is now serving a reduced sentence in his luxurious Sao Paulo mansion.

Dozens of politicians have become embroiled in the affair, including former Brazil presidents Michel Temer and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year jail sentence for accepting bribes from the company.

Peru is the other country hardest-hit by the scandal: Odebrecht has admitted paying at least $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials since 2004.

Officials in Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama and the Dominican Republic have also been tainted.

According to the US Justice Department, Odebrecht paid $788 million in bribes across 12 countries, with presidents as well as former heads of state and ministers involved.

In 2018, the construction giant agreed to pay a $700 million settlement to the Brazilian government as part of a $2.6 billion package it has committed to shell out to the United States, Switzerland and Brazil."

The son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has denied allegations that he laundered public funds, including via a chocolate shop he co-owns in Rio.

Flávio Bolsonaro's shop was one of 24 properties raided by anti-corruption investigators earlier this week.

Other properties owned by him, his former advisors and members of President Bolsonaro's ex-wife's family were also raided.

Flávio Bolsonaro, now a senator, was a Rio state deputy from 2003 to 2018.

The investigation relates to the alleged practice of ""rachadinha"" - diverting the salaries of non-existent employees, which is alleged to have taken place during this period.

On Thursday, President Bolsonaro - who was elected after vowing to end corruption - declined to comment, saying: ""I can only answer for myself.""

Last month the president launched a new political party, the Alliance for Brazil, which he said would be dedicated to fighting corruption and advancing Christian values. Flávio Bolsonaro would be the party's vice-president, he said.

What happened in the raids?

Brazilian media have been reporting details of the investigation that were contained in a document allegedly leaked from the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor's office.

In a YouTube video, Flávio Bolsonaro criticised the supposed leak, denied all the allegations and said he was being persecuted.

""Now they are attacking my chocolate shop, which was bought with my wife's and my own resources,"" he said.

""If I wanted to launder money, would I open a franchise which is subject to external checks by the franchiser and auditors?"" he added.

He also rejected accusations that he had laundered money through the purchase of two apartments in Rio's Copacabana area.

""I bought them from a group of American investors that was leaving Brazil and obviously I was able to negotiate a better price because it was two properties from the same seller. Can't I buy it cheaper? Do I have to pay more to avoid suspicion?"" he said.

His lawyer Frederick Wassef has asked Brazil's Federal Supreme Court to suspend the investigation, Brazilian media reported.

Mr Wassef said the senator had reacted to news of the searches ""with surprise, but with complete peace"".

One of Flávio Bolsonaro's former aides, Fabrício Queiroz, is being investigated on suspicion of helping skim ghost workers' salaries, the Rio state prosecutor's office said in a statement.

In a statement, Mr Queiroz said he was left surprised but unworried by the raids."

71	Dan	Helen Coffey	Induvidual	https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/morocco-travel-advice-it-safe-terrorism-fco-foreign-office-a8833211.html	"Morocco has a heightened threat of terrorism, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

The FCO updated its travel advice on 20 March to “reflect an increased threat” of terrorism in the north African country.

“Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco. You should be vigilant at all times,” reads the new travel advisory.

The advice follows the murders of two women who were hiking in the Atlas Mountains in December.

In April 2011, 17 people were killed and 25 injured in a large explosion caused by a bomb in Marrakech at the Argana Restaurant in Djema el-Fna Square.

The Moroccan authorities have warned of an increased threat linked to the number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh (formerly known as ISIL) and other extremist groups, and regularly report the disruption of terrorist cells across the country, according to the FCO.

Some of these cells have intended to carry out attacks in Morocco against government installations, public spaces and tourist sites.

The FCO warns that attacks could be indiscriminate or target foreigners.

Protective security measures, including security personnel, may be visible in areas including hotels and popular tourist sites.

However, despite the updated advisory, the FCO doesn’t currently advise against travel to anywhere in Morocco, other than the disputed territory of Western Sahara.

“Around 650,000 visitors from the UK come to Morocco every year,” reads its travel summary. “Most visits are trouble-free.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605368949883-77c036a912c0369d', 'domain': 'independent.co.uk', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/morocco-travel-advice-it-safe-terrorism-fco-foreign-office-a8833211.html', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/morocco-travel-advice-it-safe-terrorism-fco-foreign-office-a8833211.html', 'author': 'Helen Coffey', 'images': ['https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/8gvdYvNe-9ygSIn9G.html', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/AbroadMarrakechEP1KH8.jpg?width=982&height=726'], 'headline': 'Morocco travel advice: Foreign Office warns UK tourists of heightened terror threat', 'mainImage': 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/AbroadMarrakechEP1KH8.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'Morocco has a heightened threat of terrorism, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).\n\nThe FCO updated its travel advice on 20 March to “reflect an increased threat” of terrorism in the north African country.\n\n“Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco.

195	Canberk	Bank of Lithuania	Company	https://fintech-bulletin.com/bank-of-lithuania-calls-for-unified-eu-approach-to-fight-money-laundering/	"Harmonisation of rules and requirements throughout the European Union (EU) would help to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) efforts in an effective manner, eliminate existing regulatory fragmentation and ensure a unified European approach, according to the Bank of Lithuania.

“With requirements for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing continuously growing more rigid and given the free movement of financial services within the single market, everyone needs more clarity and precision. This would help financial market participants operating both in Lithuania and other EU countries to expand their activities in the single market,” said Marius Jurgilas, Member of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.

On 7 May 2020, the European Commission adopted an action plan for a comprehensive Union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing and launched a public consultation. The action plan builds on six pillars, including developing a single EU rulebook for combating money laundering and terrorist financing and creating an EU level supervisory framework (mechanism).

According to the Bank of Lithuania, common rules, especially in areas such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, would bring more clarity both to financial market participants and supervisory authorities.

Currently, rules and requirements for market participants as well as supervisory practices in EU Member States vary, which gives rise to numerous questions concerning their treatment and uniform application. A common approach, possibly in the form of regulations, would help to tackle this issue.

Should a new authority be established to tackle this issue across the EU, it is important to ensure that it does not duplicate the work of national supervisory authorities, does not give rise to disproportionate administrative costs and strikes a good balance between national and European responsibilities, it added.

The central bank’s position was submitted in the framework of the European Commission’s public consultation on the review of the EU legal framework on AML/CTF."

47	Wanting	Vitalii Antonenko	individual	https://www.fintechdirect.net/2020/05/28/boston-lawmakers-charge-ukrainian-over-94m-money-laundering-case/	"Law enforcement agencies in Boston have charged a Ukrainian national with hacking, credit card trafficking and money laundering conspiracies in a $94 million case.

According to the US Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts, Vitalii Antonenko, 28, (and residing in New York), was indicted on one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorised access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorised access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

In March 2019, Antonenko was arrested and detained on money laundering charges at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after he arrived there from Ukraine carrying computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.

Last year, Antonenko’s lawyers requested a psychiatric evaluation as they said he had difficulty communicating and suggested he is covertly working for the CIA. (Reminds me of the 2002 movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.)

In this latest development, he’s only been charged, but depending on the outcome Antonenko could face 20 years in jail and be fined up to $500,000 over the money laundering conspiracy.

As alleged in the indictment, Antonenko and (unnamed) co-conspirators scoured the internet for computer networks with security vulnerabilities that were likely to contain credit and debit card account numbers, expiration dates, and card verification values (payment card data) and other personally identifiable information (PII).

They used a hacking technique known as a “SQL injection attack” to access those networks without authorisation, extracted payment card data and other PII, and transferred it for sale on online criminal marketplaces. Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership and control.

US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the US Secret Service Boston Field Office made the announcement. Assistant US Attorney Seth B. Kosto of Lelling’s Cybercrime Unit is prosecuting the case.

The US Attorney’s Office reminds everyone the details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often get a bad rap. Why? Usually because of the criminal activities linked to it. There are too many stories to mention, but just this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement action in the US against a dastardly Dane for his $1.5 million foreign currency (forex) fraud scheme and registration violations.

Client funds were withdrawn from the US bank accounts by Casper Mikkelsen through his debit card, as well as transferred from the US bank accounts to an overseas bank, and from there to a Bitcoin address for Mikkelsen’s benefit. Mikkelsen then used the money to pay certain clients purported forex trading profits as is typical in a Ponzi scheme."

laundering conspiracies in a $94 million case.</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to the US Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts, Vitalii Antonenko, 28, (and residing in New York), was indicted on one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorised access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorised access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2019, Antonenko was arrested and detained on money laundering charges at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after he arrived there from Ukraine carrying computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Antonenko’s lawyers requested a psychiatric evaluation as they said he had difficulty communicating and suggested he is covertly working for the CIA. (Reminds me of the 2002 movie <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>In this latest development, he’s only been charged, but depending on the outcome Antonenko could face 20 years in jail and be fined up to $500,000 over the money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Antonenko and (unnamed) co-conspirators scoured the internet for computer networks with security vulnerabilities that were likely to contain credit and debit card account numbers, expiration dates, and card verification values (payment card data) and other personally identifiable information (PII).</p>\n\n<p>They used a hacking technique known as a “SQL injection attack” to access those networks without authorisation, extracted payment card data and other PII, and transferred it for sale on online criminal marketplaces. Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership and control.</p>\n\n<p>US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the US Secret Service Boston Field Office made the announcement. Assistant US Attorney Seth B. Kosto of Lelling’s Cybercrime Unit is prosecuting the case.</p>\n\n<p>The US Attorney’s Office reminds everyone the details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often get a bad rap. Why? Usually because of the criminal activities linked to it. There are too many stories to mention, but just this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement action in the US against a <a href=""https://www.fintechdirect.net/2020/05/19/cftc-dishes-out-pain-to-dane-in-gntfxs-1-5m-forex-fraud/"">dastardly Dane</a> for his $1.5 million foreign currency (forex) fraud scheme and registration violations.</p>\n\n<p>Client funds were withdrawn from the US bank accounts by Casper Mikkelsen through his debit card, as well as transferred from the US bank accounts to an overseas bank, and from there to a Bitcoin address for Mikkelsen’s benefit. Mikkelsen then used the money to pay certain clients purported forex trading profits as is typical in a Ponzi scheme.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-06-01T13:32:35+00:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '28 May 2020'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	0	money laundering	Canberk		Boston lawmakers charge Ukrainian over $94m money laundering case
136	Dan	Stephen Davey	Person	https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2019-09-06/fraudster-jailed-after-posing-as-police-officer-and-solicitor-to-con-victims	"A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about £8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than £400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about £400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft."

fees.</p>\n\n<p>Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children\'s school.</p>\n\n<p>The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.</p>\n\n<p>She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""</p>\n\n<p>The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.</p>\n\n<p>Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.</p>\n\n<p>He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".</p>\n\n<p>In an email shown to the court, the defendant\'s mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can\'t and I think it\'s unfair that he\'s unable to move on.""</p>\n\n<p>Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.</p>\n\n<p>Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.</p>\n\n<p>""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""</p>\n\n<p>Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.</p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2019-09-06T09:59:08Z', 'datePublishedRaw': '2019-09-06T09:59:08Z'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion':

301	Sebastien	Penny Pritzker	individual	https://americablog.com/2013/05/how-corrupt-is-penny-pritzger-obamas-latest-cabinet-appointee.html	"How corrupt is Penny Pritzker, Obama’s latest cabinet appointee?

I mean that question literally. I don’t think we know the degree to which she is corrupt. I’m going to quote Rick Perlstein at The Nation, in part 1 of a two-part report (psst: watch for part 2).

Perlstein is the king of research. Penny Pritzker and her family are queens of the privately held, union-hating Hyatt Hotel chain.

Pay attention, kids (my emphasis and some reparagraphing):

Penny Pritzker’s Commerce (Part One)

In December of 2008, Obama’s choice for Secretary of Commerce, Chicago-based business tycoon Penny Pritzker, withdrew her name from consideration in the face of a triple-barreled onslaught.

First, there was her position on the board of Superior Bank, which her family bought with the help of $645 million in tax credits for the federal government. In 2001, Superior collapsed after pioneering the bottom-feeding trade in subprime mortgages. In In These Times, David Moberg called it a “mini-Enron scandal”; 1,406 uninsured depositors lost their savings.

Here was what one of the victims had to say: “ The Pritzkers are crooks. They don’t care anything about people who spent their whole lives trying to save.” And here is how Penny responded: “We had seven years of clean audits and then the auditors said, ‘Well, maybe we’ll change the way we calculate.’ ” Exquisite humanity, that.

The family coughed up $435 million in settlement money in exchange for not having to admit any wrongdoing. But why, Penny was asked, would they pay half a billion dollars to clean up a mess she said was none of their fault? Because, she answered, “My family is not going to litigate with the federal government at a time like this”—a reference to the September 11 attacks; classy.

Here was the second concern which kept her from the Commerce Department in 2008: “Whether she could disentangle herself,” as The Washington Post put it, from her family’s “vast financial holdings”—many of which they would prefer not to see scrutinized in public. How vast? Well, way back in 1973, The New York Times reported of “The Very Private Pritzkers,” “The family law firm, Pritzker & Prizker, hasn’t accepted an outside client for thirty years because of the potential conflict of interest with the Pritzker enterprises, which are too numerous for any one member of the family to recall at any given moment.”

In 1982, when the list became public for the very first time—more on why later—the holdings included at least 216 separate corporate entities, from mining to motels. One current holding is TransUnion—Penny is chairman of the board—which is one of three companies controlling the creepy trade in credit reports. “After widespread consumer complaints about shoddy service in the credit checking industry,” Bloomberg reported back in 2008, “the US Congress passed legislation in 2003 that allowed people to obtain free copies of credit reports so they could check for mistakes and block information obtained from identity theft.

That same year, a jury awarded Judy Thomas of Klamath Falls, Oregon, $5.3 million after she claimed TransUnion took six years to correct a mistake in her credit report.” Penny’s reaction? Public-spirited as ever: “The company has always encouraged consumers to monitor their reports, Pritzker says.

” The third reason Obama chose not to risk political capital on a Penny Pritzker nomination fight is that unions despise her.

And that just gets you started. This is truly a must-read. Perlstein marshals his facts, and his writing is as clear and accessible as it always is. Do click through. Pritzker is an Obama campaign-funds bundler, by the way. Do you smell a motive for nomination?

Perlstein closes:

If Republican senators have any strategic sense, they’ll be asking in open hearings about this sort of stuff: how the Pritzkers came by all those billions in the first place, how they’ve kept it from the view of the public and the taxman both, and what it is they’ve been so eager to hide. I’ll have more to say about that tomorrow.

To put it lightly: It’s not the kind of thing Barack Obama needs America to hear about one of his cabinet appointees.

Let’s just see if (a) Senate Republicans are so p-ed at Barack Obama that they 60-vote Penny Pritzker, or (b) Senate Republicans give a bye to Penny Pritzker, one of their own.

Why does Leona Helmsley come to mind? Dunno.

166	Shakshi	Fernain RODRIGUEZ VASQUEZ	Individual	https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-252B-3627	"The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday it placed Kingpin Act sanctions on an alleged Colombian drug trafficker, along with seven other individuals and five entities supporting him.

Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez leads an international drug-trafficking and money laundering organization based in Colombia that exported nearly 100 tons of cocaine per year, Treasury said. He also managed the daily narcotics trafficking operations of Jorge Fadlallah Cheaitelly, who was placed under sanctions in December 2011, Treasury said.

""These sanctions will expose Rodriguez Vasquez's illicit network of agents and front companies and exclude them from the legitimate financial system,"" said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in a statement.

In addition, Treasury placed sanctions on seven of Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez's associates, all of whom were indicted Feb. 14 in the Eastern District of Texas on drug-trafficking charges, Treasury said. As a result of arrest warrants and the indictment, Treasury said Colombian authorities arrested 11 people in August 2013, including Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez and four others targeted Wednesday with sanctions.

Those arrested were known to collaborate with the FARC rebels, as well as Mexico's Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Treasury said. Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez utilized FARC to protect cocaine labs in Colombia and to escort drug loads, and he provided Zetas members with tons of cocaine, which was ultimately distributed in the U.S., Treasury said."

406	Carel	Carl Ferrer	Individual	https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/november/why-the-dallas-observer-was-sold/	"In late September, Joe Tone, the young editor of the Dallas Observer, broke the news to his staff that they would soon be moving offices. But they wouldn’t be going far, just four floors down in their building on the corner of Oak Lawn and Maple. In his pleasant, Midwestern way, he explained that the paper was moving to distance itself from Backpage.com, the classified ad site owned by the Observer’s parent company. That company, Village Voice Media, was based in Phoenix, but Backpage.com, which has been associated with prostitution and underage sex trafficking, was based right here in Dallas, where it ran operations just down the hall from Tone’s office.

In a blog post that went live at 12:14 am on Monday, September 24, he offered more details about the move: “The longtime owners of the Dallas Observer have sold the paper and its 12 Village Voice Media sister publications to a group of VVM executives, creating a new holding company and cutting ties with Backpage.com, the controversial classified advertising company. So: we have new owners, but the same old bosses.” The new company, based in Denver, is called Voice Media Group.

The “longtime owners” Tone referred to are Mike Lacey and his business partner Jim Larkin, who founded Phoenix New Times in 1970 and grew it into Village Voice Media, the nation’s largest chain of alternative weeklies. (Disclosure: I worked as a staff writer for VVM for three and a half years.) Lacey is a charismatic but prickly man, known for his colorful language, his love of Scotch, and his unwillingness to back down from a fight. He once went to jail as part of a long battle against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

But it seemed the prostitution ads on Backpage.com, which have run in the Observer for years, had generated too much bad press and forced too many national advertisers to sever their ties with VVM. “Backpage.com has been a distraction, there’s no doubt about it,” Scott Tobias, head of the new Voice Media Group, told the Wall Street Journal. But the site was also too profitable to let go. The “adult” section of Backpage.com brings in an estimated $22 million a year. It appeared Lacey had decided to get out of the journalism business in favor of the sex business. He cast the move in different terms. In the few interviews he did after the separation announcement, he said his decision to sell the papers but keep Backpage.com was a “First Amendment issue.”

Backpage.com started in 2004. It’s the brainchild of a former Observer classified ad salesman named Carl Ferrer, a shadowy figure who cannot be seen or interviewed by reporters. (Liz McDougall, general counsel for Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC, would confirm nothing about the creator of Backpage.com, even his name, saying it’s for his own safety and “so he can focus on the business.”) The site is a person-to-person marketplace, similar to Craigslist. Backpage.com offers an adult section, with categories such as “escorts,” “body rubs,” “strippers & strip clubs,” and “adult jobs.” While plenty of the ads are placed by willing, adult women, the site has also been used by pimps to peddle women, some of them underage.

When Craigslist shut down its adult listings in 2010, after a serial killer used the site to lure victims, Backpage.com thrived, eventually accounting for a reported 70 percent of all prostitution ads in the country. There are now listings for every state in America and for countries on every continent except Antarctica.

The trouble for Backpage.com really began earlier this year, when New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote a series of articles excoriating the site. Kristof, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting on human rights violations in China and genocide in Africa, documented the case of a girl who had been sold as a sex slave on the site when she was 16 years old. Then he pressured VVM’s financiers (including Goldman Sachs) and national advertisers (including Warner Bros., Disney, and Target) to cut ties with the company until Backpage.com agreed to remove the escort ads.

Representatives from VVM tried to make the case that removing the ads would drive the online escort business underground and offshore, making it even more dangerous for the women and children most at risk. But a national campaign sprang up with an online petition that collected 200,000 signatures from people demanding that the ads come down. A website called Village Voice Pimps began documenting dozens of sex trafficking cases nationwide that involved Backpage.com. Activists emailed media outlets across the country with lists of local advertisers that had agreed to stop placing ads in VVM papers.
The company felt the pinch, and by the end of the summer, VVM was laying off writers across its chain of papers.

When the sale of the papers was announced, something strange happened. The management buyout, readers were told, was backed by a private equity fund. But how much money was involved and, more important, who was involved—those details were kept private. If VVM was losing ad revenue because of its ownership of Backpage.com, then it stands to reason that part of the value of the fund’s investment in the weekly papers lies in recapturing that money. And the best way to do that would be to make it plain that the new owners are, in fact, new. Shrouding the private equity fund in secrecy only invites speculation. Andrea Powell, the executive director of FAIR Girls—an organization that helps at-risk girls, including some trafficked on Backpage.com—has called the sale “a smoke-and-mirrors effort” on national television. Too, it is rare for media outlets to not reveal their ownership simply because every hard-hitting story would be open to the criticism that it was written to further the interests of a secret, faceless owner.

Before the split, VVM tried to make its case to outside reporters. Now the entire organization—both sides of it—has become tight-lipped. Through their attorney, Lacey and Larkin have declined interviews. Tone said he couldn’t comment, instead deferring to a public relations woman in New York; she would only say that all the financials are “a private matter.” Tobias, who is in charge of the Observer’s new ownership group, would only answer questions over email. When asked why his company isn’t being transparent about its new sources of income, he replied with a canned statement that read, in part: “This was a business decision involving two companies who realized they have two separate missions—one in news and entertainment and one focused exclusively in digital classifieds—and both are better off focusing on those separate missions.”

Interestingly enough, hours after the split was announced, Village Voice Pimps posted some new information on its site. The group had found the trademark registration for the new Voice Media Group logo. It was registered in July—two months before the sale—to Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC. That means the logo of the new supposedly independent company is owned by Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.

There’s also this: for all the things Lacey is known for—the drinking, the rabble-rousing—the 64-year-old multimillionaire is also known for the ink on his hands. Across his knuckles are tattooed the words “HOLD FAST.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605092728671-9c77c269c5744aa3', 'domain': 'dmagazine.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/november/why-the-dallas-observer-was-sold/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/november/why-the-dallas-observer-was-sold/', 'author': 'Michael J.

276	Darya	Piaccf	company	https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/02/11/dr-m-launches-foundation-to-support-victimised-anti-corruption-officers	"PUTRAJAYA: A foundation has been launched to provide assistance to officers of anti-corruption agencies who are victimised, persecuted or abused for carrying out their duties.

The Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion Foundation (Piaccf) is also meant to help those who have been intimidated, threatened or maliciously punished while on duty.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the foundation would be responsible for the International Anti-Corruption Champion Fund and to complement the aspirations of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (Uncac).

""We know that combating and exposing corruption is very dangerous, and the world has witnessed many who attempted to do so pay dearly, even with their lives.

""Obviously, those who involve themselves in corruption are powerful and rich, and their objectives are for more power and wealth and to have the means and resources to punish and stop those who attempt to put an end to their shenanigans.

""We are here to tell the world that all the anti-corruption officers who have paid heavy prices in the course of their duty are our champions and our heroes,"" he said when launching the foundation on Tuesday night (Feb 11).

The Prime Minister paid tribute to the contributions of several individuals in the fight against corruption.

They include former attorney-general Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, former Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief commissioner Datuk Seri Shukri Abdull in relation to the 1MDB scandal.

""It is a significant case, as it became the turning point of Malaysia’s political direction and sparked an awakening among Malaysians.

""Their collective courage and determination brought a kleptocratic regime down, in an unprecedented show of people's power.

""I would also like to express my utmost respect to all the men and women across the globe who had given their time, lives and commitment in putting an end to the corruption scourge,"" said Dr Mahathir.

The event also saw two anti-graft officers being honoured after having paid a heavy price in their efforts to combat corruption.

The recipients of the Perdana International Anti-Corruption Champion 2020 Award are Datuk Anthony Kevin Morais, a senior deputy public prosecutor who was murdered in 2015 while investigating a corruption scandal, and Novel Baswedan, an officer with Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission, who during one of his investigations in June 2016, had acid thrown at him.

It left him partially blind.

""Indeed, there are many other brave officers who suffered in upholding their integrity.

""To them, the awards to Morais and Baswedan symbolise our appreciation to all of them,"" said the Prime Minister.

Dr Mahathir said he was proud Malaysia had taken a leading role in addressing issues affecting anti-corruption officers, starting with the introduction of the foundation.

""I sincerely hope that our contribution will send the message to all the officers of the anti-corruption agency that the government of Malaysia is with you all the way.

""And, this should also send the message to the corrupt and corruptors that we do not want you in our midst,"" he said."

7	Canberk	Modulr	Company	https://thefintechtimes.com/the-fintech-modulr-has-today-launched-confirmation-of-payee-a-fraud-prevention-initiative-spearheaded-by-payuk/	"The fintech Modulr has today launched Confirmation of Payee, a fraud prevention initiative spearheaded by Pay.UK, it is officially the first non-bank or building society to do so.

The feature provides an extra layer of defence to protect Modulr’s customers from malicious redirect payment fraud, also known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud. This is the second Modulr product launch to come out of its £10m grant from the Capability and Innovation Fund (CIF) under the RBS Alternative Remedies package. Modulr, an authorised electronic money institution, is the first non-bank or building society to join Confirmation of Payee after the mandated institutions.

APP fraud describes when a person is tricked into approving a payment to a fraudster’s account, through social engineering, manipulation or deceit. These scams cost businesses and consumers millions every year – and there’s often little recourse to get back stolen money.

That’s because with push payments, users enter the beneficiary’s details and there’s an assumption of trust before the payment is made – as opposed to pull payments such as card-present payments where the user is generally protected by chargeback rights, or Direct Debits.

With Confirmation of Payee, Modulr’s customers will have greater assurance their payments are going to the right recipient when they’re paying a business or personal account. Confirmation of Payee calls on Modulr’s API and automatically checks that the recipient’s name and account details match the information held by their payment service provider.

If the details don’t match, the user will be warned so they can confirm the details with the person or organisation they’re trying to pay. Not only does this help protect against fraud, it also helps to avoid simple mistakes like accidentally mistyping account details when setting up a beneficiary.

The benefits for businesses will be significant. Confirmation of Payee can dramatically reduce the risk of direct financial losses incurred by fraud. It can also save operational costs by reducing the number of payments that need to be investigated or recalled.

Confirmation of Payee will be a powerful tool in industries such as lending. Lenders often rely on bank validation tools to protect themselves against fraud – but these are expensive, can become outdated, and are easy for fraudsters to opt-out of. Confirmation of Payee provides a much more reliable and cost-effective alternative, as it draws on the payee’s bank data in real-time.

Confirmation of Payee will also have a strong impact in the alternative banking sector. Neobanks are fighting two battles when it comes to fraud – they must protect their customers from becoming victims of scams and prevent customers from using their accounts to commit fraud. CoP can help to fight back against both, protecting the reputation of neobanks and their customers.

Myles Stephenson, Chief Executive and founder of Modulr, says: “We’re committed to delivering the very latest innovation in payments to our customers, and I’m delighted that we are the first non-bank or building society to offer Confirmation of Payee. Thousands of consumers and businesses fall victim to social engineering scams every year in the UK. Modulr is always looking for ways to help our customers keep their money safe.

“We’re pleased to announce the launch of Confirmation of Payee offers greater assurance to businesses and consumers when making payments. This is a crucial step forward in the ongoing battle against fraud and it’s going to help us build a safer payments ecosystem in the UK.”

Brian Cunnington, SME for the CoP project team, Pay.UK says: “We are delighted to see Confirmation of Payee now making a difference in the UK payments environment. The new service offers protection for consumers through the account name checking service, reducing errors and fraudulent misdirection of funds.”"	"[{'query': {'id': '1605373791941-be2afa8791b75a10', 'domain': 'thefintechtimes.com', 'userQuery': {'url': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/the-fintech-modulr-has-today-launched-confirmation-of-payee-a-fraud-prevention-initiative-spearheaded-by-payuk/', 'pageType': 'article'}}, 'article': {'url': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/the-fintech-modulr-has-today-launched-confirmation-of-payee-a-fraud-prevention-initiative-spearheaded-by-payuk/', 'author': 'Manisha Patel', 'images': ['https://thefintechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/iStock-1223732348-960x565.jpg'], 'headline': 'Modulr Launches Confirmation of Payee to Help Crack Down on Fraud', 'mainImage': 'https://thefintechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/iStock-1223732348-960x565.jpg', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'articleBody': 'The fintech Modulr has today launched Confirmation of Payee, a fraud prevention initiative spearheaded by Pay.UK, it is officially the first non-bank or building society to do so.\n\nThe feature provides an extra layer of defence to protect Modulr’s customers from malicious redirect payment fraud, also known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud.

92	Karl			http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2020-02-17/army-general-raul-castro-ruz-honored-for-contributions-to-urban-suburban-and-family-agriculture	"SEGUNDO FRENTE, Santiago de Cuba.– A plaque recognizing Army General Raul Castro Ruz for his contributions to the Urban, Suburban and Family Farming Program, since its creation, was accepted by Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz, during a national meeting here of participants in the movement, to assess progress being made.

Announcing the award, program national director Dr. Elizabeth Peña Turruellas stated that 32 years after Raul proposed generalizing the tradition of growing vegetables in family gardens, in soil enriched organically, we can say that the first part of this task has been completed.

Dr. Peña, also a member of the Council of State, added that the program has become a strong popular movement, ready to do much more to increase municipal food supplies and develop local self-sufficiency, in an effort that has always benefitted from Raúl’s accurate strategic direction.

With the participation of Lazaro Expósito Canto and Beatriz Johnson Urrutia, the province’s top Party and government authorities, respectively, as well as Minister of Agriculture Gustavo Rodriguez Rollero and leading producers from across the country, Dr. Peña presented a report on last year’s accomplishments and new goals.

She stated that the 21 sub-programs (five for targeted crops, five for animal husbandry and 11 for support), involve some 800,000 people around the country, 31% are women, while in the basic program focused on vegetables and fresh seasonings, 1,277,517 tons of food were grown in organic, intensive cultivation gardens, greenhouses, and plots with technical support.

Animal husbandry in backyards and small plots produced 100,600 tons of meat from small livestock (pigs, sheep, goats, poultry, and rabbits), as well as more than 300 million eggs and 750,000 liters of goat's milk, in addition to fish produced in ponds, reservoirs and other reservoirs.

Given its consistent efforts over the last year, Segundo Frente was declared the country’s most outstanding municipality, in recognition of results that have earned the movement here recognition as a National Reference for 16 consecutive years, while Santiago de Cuba was honored as the number one province, followed by Havana, Sancti Spíritus and Pinar del Río.

Dr. Peña reported that the suburban program now includes 147,563 farms, and that last year 34,000 individuals were trained in different programs, with a similar number expected to participate in classes this year.

Likewise, some 1,732 hectares of idle land is projected to be recovered for cultivation this year, she stated."

14	Carel	Ahmed Ouyahia	Individual	https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/4/two-former-prime-ministers-go-on-trial-for-corruption-in-algeria	"Two former prime ministers in Algeria have gone on trial on corruption charges, in the most high-profile act of transparency and accountability since a pro-democracy movement pushed out the long-serving president.

The exceptional trial, which is being televised and also involves several other former Algerian power players, comes at a time of renewed political tensions in the oil and gas-rich country, a week in advance of a controversial election to replace President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

Ahmed Ouyahia, who was forced out as prime minister in March as protests against Bouteflika escalated, and his predecessor Abdelmalek Sellal, testified Wednesday at the Sidi M’Hamed court in Algiers.

The accused face charges ranging from money laundering to abuse of office and granting undue privileges in the vehicle assembly industry.

Lawyer Mohamed Madjdoub, speaking on behalf of the defence, told the judge that “conditions … do not allow for lawyers to accomplish their mission and therefore, I inform you that the defence has decided to boycott the trial”.

The judge asked the lawyers to leave the small, crowded courtroom and said the proceedings would continue.

The nascent Algerian automotive sector got its start in 2014, via partnerships between foreign groups and large Algerian corporations, often owned by businessmen linked to Bouteflika’s entourage.

Setting a precedent

It is the first time since Algeria’s independence from France in 1962 that former prime ministers have been put on trial.

The two men argued that the court was not competent to try them, the constitution stipulating that crimes and infractions committed by prime ministers while in office fell under a “High Court of State”.

But the organic law to establish this court was not passed and the prosecutor responded that they had to answer for their actions before the ordinary court.

Called first to the stand, Ouyahia was accused of “misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office, granting undue privileges, conflict of interest, corruption, money laundering and false statements”.

He was charged with favouring certain manufacturers in the automotive sector – even if they did not fulfil brief specifications – to the detriment of competitors.

“There is no misappropriation (of public funds) and the choice … was based on the market. These manufacturers were already present and we wanted to keep them,” the former prime minister said in his defence.

Former ministers Bedda Mahdjoub (industry and mines), Youcef Yousfi, who succeeded him in the post, and Abdelghani Zaalane (public works and transport) are other defendants in the case.

Also standing trial was Ali Haddad, former head of the main Algerian employer organisation, the Forum of Business Leaders (FCE).

The 54-year-old businessman is also the founder and CEO of private construction firm ETRHB.

Among the other businessmen being tried is former FCE vice president Mohamed Bairi, CEO of the Ival group, which owns industrial vehicle plant Iveco.

Ahmed Mazouz, president of the eponymous group that assembles and distributes Chinese-brand vehicles in Algeria, and Hassane Arbaoui, head of Global Group which runs an Algerian factory for South Korean company Kia, are also defendants.

Key issue

Algerian authorities are hoping the trial helps convince the public that they are serious about fighting corruption and reforming themselves – and persuade them to go out and vote next week.

Corruption is a key issue for Algeria’s peaceful, 9-month-old protest movement, which considers the election a sham because it’s organised by the existing power structure. Protesters want a whole new political system instead.

“Only the people can judge whether we have the will to combat corruption,” Justice Minister Belkacem Zeghmati told legislator before the trial, describing the alleged corruption as “going beyond all comprehension.”

52	Sebastien			https://www.nj.com/cumberland/2020/10/police-captain-files-new-suit-alleging-retaliation-for-fighting-corruption.html	"A police captain whose federal lawsuit alleging he was retaliated against for uncovering corruption was recently dismissed has taken his case to state Superior Court.

Vineland Police Captain Adam Austino sued in February, claiming he was demoted, denied promotions and targeted with phony allegations after exposing wrongdoing in the department and the local PBA.

That suit was dismissed in September, with a judge finding Austino waited too long to file the complaint and that federal court was not the appropriate forum to address his labor grievances. The judge left open the opportunity for Austino to pursue claims in state court over alleged violations of the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act.

The Superior Court action, filed earlier this month, names the City of Vineland and Mayor Anthony Fanucci as defendants. City officials did not respond to a request seeking comment Monday morning.

Austino says retaliation began after he reported in 2012 that PBA Local 266 executive board members were embezzling funds.

Union president Steven Buglio and treasurer William Newman were charged following an investigation and Buglio pleaded guilty to two charges, while Newman entered pre-trial intervention.

After that, Austino reported in 2015 that then-police chief Timothy Codispoti was allegedly siphoning police funds for use in personal political activities. In response to the federal suit, Codispoti told NJ Advance Media in February that this matter had been investigated and no wrongdoing was found.

For making the claim, Codispoti retaliated against Austino by demoting him to a “less desirable tour of duty in the Internal Affairs Unit,” according to the suit.

While assigned there, Austino uncovered violations by the department’s street crimes unit and conducted investigations that led to serious discipline and “even criminal charges against friends and associates of the defendants.”

Wrongdoing cited in the suit included improper searches, evidence tampering, tampering with informant payment records, falsified racial profiling data, misused city funds and false reports.

Because of his work, Austino says he was falsely accused in 2016 of wiretapping PBA members and that he was ultimately exonerated of any wrongdoing. He faced more “vague and false allegations” the following year and was again cleared.

Austino says Fanucci worked with allies in the police department to create new captain positions and a deputy chief post and appointed loyalists to those jobs. Austino says he was passed over for the deputy chief job, even though a committee reviewing applicants had recommended him, and, as a result, lost out on an additional $11,000 in annual pay.

More allegations of wrongdoing against Austino followed in 2018, with the PBA targeting him and others in an attempt at intimidation, according to the suit. “Among other things, the draft complaint falsely alleged that Plaintiff had committed criminal acts.""

The multiple claims against Austino were acts of retaliation and intimidation that violate the conscientious employee protection law, the captain maintains. He seeks compensatory and punitive damages, along with appointment to the deputy chief position, which is held by Pedro Casiano.

Casiano is currently overseeing the department as acting chief.

Vineland Police Chief Rudy Beu IV is suspended pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing. He sued in March alleging he was defamed and suspended for fighting corruption in the department. Many of his allegations are similar to those raised by Austino."

The judge left open the opportunity for Austino to pursue claims in state court over alleged violations of the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act.</p>\n\n<p>The Superior Court action, filed earlier this month, names the City of Vineland and Mayor Anthony Fanucci as defendants.

149	Sebastien			https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-world-is-losing-the-money-laundering-fight/ar-BB19gttL	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- We’ve just had the closest look yet at the global battle against money laundering, and it’s deeply troubling: Banks and their regulators are nowhere near restraining the flow of trillions of dollars of illicit funds.

Both the finance industry and the authorities are to blame. Without an urgent, concerted political effort, criminals — from drug dealers and terrorists to human traffickers — will keep the upper hand.

In a year-long investigation by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, reporters pored over about 2,100 suspicious activity reports, or SARs, which lenders file to the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when they spot potential money laundering and other bad behavior.

While the number of SARs reviewed by the journalists dwarfs any previous access to these confidential documents, they’re still just a tiny fraction — 0.02% — of the 12 million or so SARs that were probably filed during the period in question, mostly 2011 through 2017. Also, the sample isn’t representative of overall banking activity. Some records stem from the U.S. congressional investigation into interference with the 2016 presidential election. Almost half of the SARs came from Deutsche Bank AG.

Still, the sums and the patterns of failings are staggering. This small number of reports alone flagged up $2 trillion of fund flows, $1.3 trillion from Deutsche Bank, that may have stemmed from criminal activity. And the FinCEN Files are just the tip of the iceberg, as Transparency International put it. (The banks’ responses to BuzzFeed are here.)

The U.K., home to more than 600 companies flagged in the reports, appears to be the biggest hub for dodgy money flows, with the U.S. second. Britain clearly hasn’t done enough to tighten laws against money launderers. A huge web of enablers, from lawyers to accountants and bankers, helps oil the wheels of illicit finance through London.

Banks, for their part, are too slow if not outright negligent in submitting SARs. More than a fifth of the documents included in the submissions related to subjects whose addresses weren’t known to the banks, including companies with whom the lenders were already banking.

SARs, which should be filed within 60 days of detecting potential criminal activity, were sometimes submitted years later. According to the BuzzFeed/ICIJ report, that was allegedly the case with JPMorgan Chase & Co., which processed payments for Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, after he resigned from the 2016 campaign amid money-laundering allegations. HSBC Holdings Plc kept moving money for an investment fund that was already under investigation over allegations it was a Ponzi scheme, the report says.

Alarmingly, banks often just rely on internet searches to find out who their clients are and only file suspicious reports after news breaks or formal investigations are launched. In the bundle of SARs reviewed by the reporters, the median filing time since the suspicious activity began was 166 days. Imagine how far those funds would have gone in half a year.

The reviewed SARs pertain to a period when many banks were already being investigated and punished for failing to adhere to money-laundering regulation. But the billions of dollars in fines levied against them haven’t changed behavior much.

Having a bigger legal stick with which to whack errant bankers and other enablers would help. So too would a rethink of how money laundering is tackled by policy makers. Police forces and national regulators don’t only struggle to cooperate across borders; even within some crime agencies, various units don’t always share information.

Tom Kirchmaier, a policing and crime researcher at the London School of Economics, suggests a three-step solution. For starters, the SARs filings must be standardized. Far too much information is submitted in narratives that are impossible to scrutinize. FinCEN employs about 270 employees, receiving up to 2 million SARs every year. “We’re still stuck in the 19th century,” Switzerland’s former top money-laundering cop Daniel Thelesklaf says of his nation’s paper-based efforts.

Second, Kirchmaier calls for far more sharing of data between regulators and enforcers. In Europe, more than 50 authorities supervise money laundering and terror financing. The European Commission will propose an EU-level supervisor next year. That’s long overdue.

Lastly, Kirchmaier says humans need to be removed from the process as far as possible. Crime agencies should be able to automate the screening of SARs and report back to banks, providing them with an assessment of the risk associated with a particular client, for example. And lenders ought to be able to stop transactions to flagged entities without so much human intervention.

A radical improvement in the fight against money laundering may not be possible overnight, but — as I’ve written before — the system isn’t working. As the speed of payments accelerates and virtual currencies proliferate, criminals will find new ways to move money. Banks and their supervisors collectively need to do much, much better.

13	Canberk	Remessa Online	Company	https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/remessa-online-raises-20-million-to-become-the-transferwise-of-latin-america/	"Remessa Online, the Brazilian money transfer service, said it has closed on $20 million in financing from one of the leading Latin American venture capital firms, Kaszek Ventures, and Accel Partners’ Kevin Efrusy, the architect of the famed venture capital firm’s Latin American investments.

Since its launch in 2016, Remessa Online has provided a pipeline for over $2 billion worth of international transfers for small and medium-sized businesses in the country. The company now boasts over 300,000 customers from 100 countries and says its fees are typically one eighth the cost of the local money transfer options.

“We understand that transferring money is just the beginning, and we are eager to build a global financial system that will make life easier for global citizens and businesses alike,” Liuzzi said.

Money transfer services are a huge business that startups have spent the last decade trying to improve in Europe and the U.S. European money transfer company, TransferWise has raised over $770 million alone in its bid to unseat the incumbents in the market. Meanwhile, the business-to-business cross-border payment gateway, Payoneer, has raised roughly $270 million to provide those services to small businesses.

Remessa Online already boasts a powerful group of investors and advisors including André Penha, the co-founder of apartment rental company QuintoAndar, and the former chief operating officer of Kraft Heinz USA, Fabio Armaganijan. With the new investment from Kaszek Ventures, firm co-founder Hernan Kazah, also the co-founder of the Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, will take a seat on the company’s board.

“We developed an online solution that is faster and substantially cheaper than traditional banking platforms, with digital and scalable processes and omnichannel customer support offered by a team of experts”, said Remessa Online’s co-founder and strategy director Alexandre Liuzzi, in a statement.

Last year, the company expanded its money transfer service to the U.K. and Europe, allowing Brazilians abroad to invest money, pay for education or rent housing without documentation or paperwork. The company’s accounts now come with an International Banking Account Number that allows its customers to receive money in nine currencies.

With the new year, Remessa has added additional services for small and medium-sized businesses and expanded its geographic footprint to include Argentina and Chile.

Latin American countries — especially Brazil — have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the economy is still reeling, the broad trends that are moving consumers and businesses to adopt e-commerce and mobile payment solutions are just as pronounced in the region as they are in the U.S., according to investors like Kazah.

“This crisis is accelerating the digitization process of several industries around the world and Remessa Online has taken the lead to transform the cross-border segment in Brazil, specially for SMBs,” he said in a statement.

Founded in 2016 by Fernando Pavani, Alexandre Liuzzi, Stefano Milo and Marcio William, Remessa Online was born from the founders own needs to find an easier way to send and receive money from abroad, according to the company.

In 2018, after a $4 million investment from Global Founders Capital and MAR Ventures, the company developed international processing capabilities and a more robust compliance tool kit to adhere to international anti-money laundering and know your customer standards. In the latter half of 2019, the company entered the SMB market with the launch of a toolkit for businesses that had been typically ignored by larger financial services institutions in Brazil.

“We believe in a world without physical borders. Our mission is to help our clients with their global financial needs, so that they can focus on what matters: their international dreams,” said Liuzzi."

11	Shakshi	Elizabeth I	Individual	https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-I	"Position under Edward VI and Mary

With her father’s death in 1547 and the accession to the throne of her frail 10-year-old brother Edward, Elizabeth’s life took a perilous turn. Her guardian, the dowager queen Catherine Parr, almost immediately married Thomas Seymour, the lord high admiral. Handsome, ambitious, and discontented, Seymour began to scheme against his powerful older brother, Edward Seymour, protector of the realm during Edward VI’s minority. In January 1549, shortly after the death of Catherine Parr, Thomas Seymour was arrested for treason and accused of plotting to marry Elizabeth in order to rule the kingdom. Repeated interrogations of Elizabeth and her servants led to the charge that even when his wife was alive Seymour had on several occasions behaved in a flirtatious and overly familiar manner toward the young princess. Under humiliating close questioning and in some danger, Elizabeth was extraordinarily circumspect and poised. When she was told that Seymour had been beheaded, she betrayed no emotion.

The need for circumspection, self-control, and political acumen became even greater after the death of the Protestant Edward in 1553 and the accession of Elizabeth’s older half sister Mary, a religious zealot set on returning England, by force if necessary, to the Roman Catholic faith. This attempt, along with her unpopular marriage to the ardently Catholic king Philip II of Spain, aroused bitter Protestant opposition. In a charged atmosphere of treasonous rebellion and inquisitorial repression, Elizabeth’s life was in grave danger. For though, as her sister demanded, she conformed outwardly to official Catholic observance, she inevitably became the focus and the obvious beneficiary of plots to overthrow the government and restore Protestantism. Arrested and sent to the Tower of London after Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion in January 1554, Elizabeth narrowly escaped her mother’s fate. Two months later, after extensive interrogation and spying had revealed no conclusive evidence of treason on her part, she was released from the Tower and placed in close custody for a year at Woodstock. The difficulty of her situation eased somewhat, though she was never far from suspicious scrutiny. Throughout the unhappy years of Mary’s childless reign, with its burning of Protestants and its military disasters, Elizabeth had continually to protest her innocence, affirm her unwavering loyalty, and proclaim her pious abhorrence of heresy. It was a sustained lesson in survival through self-discipline and the tactful manipulation of appearances.

Many Protestants and Roman Catholics alike assumed that her self-presentation was deceptive, but Elizabeth managed to keep her inward convictions to herself, and in religion as in much else they have remained something of a mystery. There is with Elizabeth a continual gap between a dazzling surface and an interior that she kept carefully concealed. Observers were repeatedly tantalized with what they thought was a glimpse of the interior, only to find that they had been shown another facet of the surface. Everything in Elizabeth’s early life taught her to pay careful attention to how she represented herself and how she was represented by others. She learned her lesson well."

65	Shakshi	China	Government	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-hongkong/chinese-official-in-hong-kong-says-some-protest-acts-terrorist-in-nature-idUSKBN2310O9	"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s foreign ministry office in Hong Kong and the city’s security chief on Monday defended proposed national security laws by describing some acts in mass pro-democracy protests last year as terrorism.

Several government departments issued statements in defence of the proposal after the biggest protest in the city since the coronavirus lockdown on Sunday.

The security legislation, some details of which were announced last week, aims to tackle secession, subversion and terrorist activities and could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, one of the world’s leading financial hubs.

Pro-democracy activists and politicians say the legislation could erode Hong Kong’s freedoms, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” agreement under which former colonial power Britain returned the territory to China in 1997.

At a briefing for diplomats, foreign business chambers and correspondents, China’s Foreign Commissioner in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, said the laws would only target a minority of “troublemakers” who had posed “imminent danger” to China’s national security.

“The legislation will alleviate the grave concerns among local and foreign business communities about the violent and terrorist forces,” Xie said.

He declined to clarify specifics of the proposed laws that have stoked concerns, including when the full legislation would be enacted, what specific acts would be outlawed, and whether it would have retroactive effect.

Asked whether the security agencies to be set up in Hong Kong would have law enforcement powers, Xie said: “Concerning the details, they are still being deliberated so I’m not in a position to tell you right now.”

Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials have come out in recent days seeking to reassure investors their interests would not be harmed and criticisng protesters.

Police Commissioner Chris Tang cited 14 cases involving explosives which he said were commonly used in terrorist attacks overseas, and five seizures of firearms and ammunition since protests began.

Secretary for Security John Lee said “terrorism is growing” and harmful activities such as calling for Hong Kong’s independence were becoming more rampant.

In scenes evoking memories of last year’s protests, crowds thronged city streets on Sunday, many chanting “Hong Kong independence, the only way out.”

Police said they arrested more than 180 people, firing tear gas and water cannon for the first time in months.

Calls for independence are anathema to Beijing, which considers Hong Kong an inalienable part of the country. The proposed framework stresses Beijing’s intent to crack down on such acts.

Protests are expected to flare again on Wednesday, with the city’s legislature set to debate a bill to criminalise abuse of China’s national anthem.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote on his blog that the national security law itself does not affect investor confidence, only the “misunderstanding” of it does.

The United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and others have expressed concerns about the legislation, widely seen as a potential turning point for China’s freest city.

Washington is considering whether to maintain Hong Kong’s special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a global financial centre.

Several foreign businessmen and diplomats expressed direct concerns towards the proposed law during Xie’s briefing.

In Bejing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the United States of “flagrantly interfering” in China’s national security legislation.

Taiwan is also considering revoking the special status it extends to Hong Kong due to China’s planned legislation, a move that could make it harder for Hong Kongers to visit and is likely to anger Beijing.

Business figures said the legislation could lead to money and talent leaving the city.

The Hong Kong Bar Association on Monday questioned the legality of a mechanism Beijing is expected to use to introduce the legislation, which annexes it to the city’s mini-constitution, bypassing public consultation and the legislature.

It also raised doubts about the legality of any new mainland agencies in the city as well as whether the independence of the judicial system will be preserved.

A Hong Kong government spokesperson said most residents and overseas investors “have nothing to fear” from the new security legislation."

"" The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed,"" more dramatically rendered in English as "" Behind every great fortune lies a great crime.""

President Obama is nominating his top fund raiser, Penny Pritzker, to be Secretary of Commerce. Incredibly - perhaps I should write, sadly - the announcement is causing hardly a stir among the liberal and progressive blogosphere. At the very least, Greg Palast's May 4, 2013 post at Smirking Chimp, Billionaire Bankster Breaks into Obama’s Cabinet, should be going viral. Palast wrote:

Pritzker’s net worth is listed in Forbes as $1.8 billion, which is one hell of a heavy magic wand in the world of politics. Her wand would have been heavier, and her net worth higher, except that in 2001, the federal government fined her and her family $460 million for the predatory, deceitful, racist tactics and practices of Superior, the bank-and-loan-shark operation she ran on the South Side of Chicago.

Superior was the first of the deregulated go-go banks to go bust – at the time, the costliest failure ever. US taxpayers lost nearly half a billion dollars. Superior’s depositors lost millions and poor folk in Sen. Obama’s South Side district lost their homes.

There were also a couple diaries on DailyKos, including by front pager Laura Clawson, who called attention to Pritzker's and her family's role in Hyatt Hotels, which has compiled what may be the worst records of labor abuses in the hotel industry. Incredibly, just to prove, I suppose, how hopelessly uninformed, ignorant, and unaware liberals and progressives can be, someone posted in one of the first comments, ""She's not the monster you think she is.""

Even President Obama rushed to show that he was likewise uninformed, ignorant, and unaware, though at this point I'm not about to attach the labels ""liberal"" or ""progressive"" to him. ""She's built companies from the ground up,"" Obama said. ""She knows from experience that no government program alone can take the place of a great entrepreneur.""

There once were, in most every city, old labor and socialist organizers, veterans of the labor strife of the 1920s and 1930s, you could sit down with in a neighborhood tavern, and during the course of an evening, well lubricated by a few pitchers of beer, tell you more than you really wanted to know about who was actually running your town. How the police chief's kids got really good paying jobs because the chief would not make too many inquiries about (in other words, would remain deliberately uninformed, ignorant, and unaware) the prostitution on the West Side; or the numbers racket along the riverfront; or the freight pilferage at the airport. How the mayor's wife was able to drive around in a brand new Cadillac because a certain tract of land had been quietly rezoned, to the advantage a mayoral crony. Such petty corruption used to be the stock in trade of good local investigative reporters at big metropolitan newspapers, back in a nearly forgotten era when FCC rules made it nearly impossible for one or two corporate behemoths to own every major newspaper, radio station, and television station in one city.

Many of you already know that I used to be an economics correspondent, and that I burned out and became depressed watching Wall Street have its way in the early 1990s in what was called, back then, ""off balance sheet liabilities"" (what we today call ""financial derivatives"" - the stuff, like credit default swaps, that blew up in 2007 through 2008, and left a dismaying amount of the world's economy in ashes). Well, that's not really the whole truth. About what got me depressed, that is. So, tonight, you're going to learn a bit more of the truth. You're going to learn some of the dark, frightful secrets hidden away in my memory; stuff I usually don't mention, because it makes a lot of people very uncomfortable.

In a word, the mob. Organized crime. The syndicate. In Chicago, it was called the Outfit. But every major city had its own crime family, or branch thereof. You see, part of what I researched and wrote about in that depressing period of nearly a quarter century ago was how the billions of dollars, nay, hundreds of billions of dollars that were fueling what was politely called mergers and acquisitions, most especially including leveraged buy outs, came from, not entirely, but in large part, organized crime. That included hundreds of billions of dollars that the Wall Street banks laundered from illegal narcotics trafficking, including heroin and cocaine. The beginnings of financial derivatives were closely tied to the mob going legit.

So, the Reagan regime of deregulation was really a double whammy. It basically decriminalized the worst behavior of banks and corporations, at the very time that some of the most immoral, ruthless, indeed murderous, people in America were buying legitimacy for themselves and their heirs by seizing control, through brazen manipulation of debt and stock markets, of America's industrial companies.

The story of the hour is Penny Pritzker becoming Secretary of Commerce. So, tonight, you're going to learn about the Pritizker family and its fortune. I suspect that it's probably more than you want to know.

The origins of the Pritzker family fortune was her grandfather's mob connections when he was a tax attorney for a lot of people in ""The Outfit,"" the Chicago mob, beginning under Al Capone, and continuing through the 1980s. This connection to organized crime was reportedly what financed the creation of Hyatt Hotels by Penny's father. There was no crime involved, but the financial backing came from organized crime, plain and simple. The details are in Gus Russo's 2006 tome Supermob: How Sidney Korshak and His Criminal Associates Became America's Hidden Power Brokers. Russo's book is crucial reading for anyone trying to understand why America's ruling elites are, well, so bad.

It's not really a matter of incompetence or ineptitude. Rather, it is a case study in how the republican (small ""r"", not capital ""R"" as in the Republican Party, or GOP - greedy old pricks) ideals of public virtue, the general welfare, and economic and political equality, are forgotten and eventually undermined by allowing a criminal class to become legitimate and amass political and economic influence. The story of the Pritzker family is an all-American story, of how a family with ties to organized crime amasses a great fortune while striving relentlessly for legitimacy, and arrives at the pinnacle of economic and political power in America. Chris Hedges is not exaggerating when he states that""the criminal class in this country has seized power.""

This ascent to America's summits is an oft-trod trek, pioneered by Boston and Newport maritime merchants who parlayed opium and millions of ruined lives in China into wealth, respectability, and power in the 1800s. Many of the mercantile banks established along the way are still with us, brightened and prettified by numerous changes in corporate branding. The one constant is the ruthless concentration on private gain. The extent to which that concentration on private gain is tempered and ameliorated by fleeting notions of public service provides the cracks and crevices in which the ebb and flow of history eddy and swirl.

Now, you can point to the Kennedy family as an example of ill-begotten gains leading to some very good minded public service. But Penny Pritzker's roles at Hyatt and Superior Bank are, to say the least, highly troubling, and cast doubt on the idea that she may be anywhere near as mindful of the general welfare as John, Bobby, and Edward Kennedy were. Instead of public service, the tradition in the Pritzker family seems focused on economic exploitation of others, skirting the law as much as possible, and shady dealings. There is a strong tradition in the Pritzker family of outright money laundering and offshore tax evasion.

Before Superior Bank, the Pritzkers controlled Frontier Finance, a loan company in Chicago that one source told Russo ""is believed to be the secret to the origins of the family's involvement with criminals."" The president of Frontier Finance was Frank Buccieri. And Buccieri's brother was the greatly feared ""collector"" for the Outfit, Fiore ""Fifi"" Buccieri, who Life magazine in May 1969 termed ""leader of [Sam] Giancana's assassination squads."" The Wikipedia entry on Fiori Buccieri is chilling:

During the bootleg wars of Prohibition, Buccieri was reportedly involved in at least 10 gangland slayings. In the 1960s, following Giancana's rise to the day-to-day ""boss"" position in the Outfit, Buccieri served as a top enforcer and personal hitman. He was also involved in labor racketeering bombing, arson and loan sharking.

As a loan shark, Buccieri would send his men to stake out employment offices. These thugs would pass out business cards to the unemployed that listed Buccieri as a, ""loan officer."" The mob generally viewed unemployed workers as poor loan prospects; however, Buccieri was so effective at intimidating his ""juice,"" or ""loan interest,"" victims that they would steal or rob to pay him off. Buccieri would often warn friends of a ""juice"" victim not to ride around with him, ""because he is going to get hit."" When the victim heard this warning, he would quickly pay up.

It is not clear whether Fiore Buccieri's ""sales pitches"" at employment offices fed ""clients"" to his brother's (and Pritzker's) Frontier Finance, but that is a reasonable assumption. Buccieri used a warehouse where he would hang his victims on a meathook (maybe Hollywood got this gruseome idea from its mob connections?), the most infamous such murder was that of loanshark William ""Action"" Jackson, in 1961. After being arrested while unloading a truck of stolen radios then released, rumor spread within the Outfit that Jackson had become an FBI informant. Buccieri and two others hung the 300-pound Jackson on a meat hook and tortured him with ice picks, baseball bats, a blow torch and an electric cattle prod for nearly three days, until Jackson finally died. Federal authorities later obtained details of Jackson's murder from conversations overheard between Buccieri and one of the other murderers.

But, you object, so far all we have is guilt by association. Uh, yeah. Get over it. In fact, learn to use it. You want a criminal indictment or conviction? Ain't going to happen. Not for the most successful criminals. As Russo quotes John P. Barnes, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois from the 1930s top 1950s: “The Syndicate could not operate without the approval of the [State's Attorney's] office.... The relationship between the State's Attorney's office, and Capone's Syndicate, under [Tom] Courtney and [Dan] Gilbert, was such that during the entire period that Courtney was in office [1932-44], no Syndicate man was ever convicted of a major crime in Cook County.""

A specialty developed and refined by the Chicago Outfit was labor racketeering. Al Capone's very own lawyer, Abe Teitelbaum got the bar rolling when he was ""hired' as the attorney for the Chicago Bar and Restaurant Association in 1932. As the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the McClellan Committee) stated in its final report in 1950, the Association, under the counsel of Teitelbaum, functioned ""principally to to defeat and destroy legitimate unionization and has callously and calculatedly used men with underworld connections to make collusive arrangements with dishonest union officials.""

Teitelbaum's labor racketeering became of forte of Sidney Korshak, who would become a key Pritzker associate. Russo writes that

In the case of unions not directly under the mob's control, it was often just a simple matter of paying off the union bosses to persuade them to accept a substandard deal, a modus operandi adopted by Sid Korshak. ""He made cash payoffs to business agents - five thousand dollars here, three thousand dollars there,"" said Leo Geffner, a Los Angeles attorney who negotiated with Korshak years later. ""I know that. That's the way it was--to keep labor peace, you'd find a corrupt business agent and pay him off."" Of course, in doing so, the racketeer stabbed both the workers and their employers in the back. Ironically, this was the very abuse suffered by Korshak's grandparents in Kiev. The ever-vigiulent Korshak gadfly, Lester Velie, succinctly described [in Readers Digest in 1957] how the treachery worked: ""The deal may be to bring a ""friendly"" union in, or to keep a union out, or to accept substandard wages.... In the deals that the go-between arranges, the union's function is perverted. Instead of serving as an instrument to win better wages and working conditions, it becomes a tool for keeping the worker in line. Thus it performs the same function as the unions do in Communist Russia.""

What do you think? Would it be impolite to ask Penny Pritizker, in her confirmation hearings, about her grandfather's relations to organized crime? Is it impolite to ask her if her ideas about suppressing workers wages are in any way informed or influenced by the role of her grandfather's associates in smashing and corrupting unions? It does seem to be a tradition in her family.

Is it impolite to ask about the similarities in the business models of Frontier Finance in the 1950s and Superior Bank in the 1990s? And is Penny Pritzker now willing, without hesitation, to condemn the type of banking practices that seem to be another family tradition among the Pritzkers? Back in February 2008, Dennis Bernstein reported, in Obama's Sub-Prime Conflict,

Though Superior Bank collapsed years before the current sub-prime turmoil that is rocking the world’s financial markets – and pushing those millions of homeowners toward foreclosure – some banking experts say the Pritzkers and Superior hold a special place in the history of the sub-prime fiasco.

“The [sub-prime] financial engineering that created the Wall Street meltdown was developed by the Pritzkers and Ernst and Young, working with Merrill Lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub-prime mortgages,” Timothy J. Anderson, a whistleblower on financial and bank fraud, told me in an interview.

“The sub-prime mortgages,” Anderson said, “were provided to Merrill Lynch, by a nation-wide Pritzker origination system, using Superior as the cash cow, with many millions in FDIC insured deposits. Superior’s owners were to sub-prime lending, what Michael Milken was to junk bonds”

In other words, if you traced today’s sub-prime crisis back to its origins, you would come upon the
role of the Pritzkers and Superior Bank of Chicago.... When it collapsed in 2001, Superior Bank represented the largest failure of a U.S.-insured depository institution for a decade.

“The failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to the Bank’s Board of Directors and executives ignoring sound risk management principles,” said FDIC Inspector General Gaston Gianni Jr. in a Feb. 7, 2002, report.

Banking whistleblower Anderson noted that “Superior failed at a time of historically low interest rates, high employment, a strong economy, and a growing housing market.… There was no reason for it to fail unless you consider gross negligence, a flawed business plan, and a conspiracy to deceive the regulators who were clearly asleep and were negligent themselves in their duties of protecting the class of underinsured depositors.”

A few voices the past few weeks have raised the issue of Hyatt Hotels and Superior Bank, but this past week, Rick Perlstein's two-part article in The Nation, raised an even more troubling chapter of Pritzker history: the family's connection to Castle Bank of the Bahamas. According to Russo (pages 439 ff.) Castle Bank was the granddaddy of offshore money laundering and tax evasion. Castle Bank was set up in 1964 by former senior Office of Strategic Services officer Paul Helliwell, who had become an important cutout for hiding CIA funds; Morris Kleinman of the Cleveland organized crime family headed by Moe Dalitz; Burton Kanter, a tax attorney for the Pritzkers, and a board member of Hyatt; and Stanford Clinton, a partner in grandpa Pritzker's law firm, and a trustee of the Teamsters Pension Fund, which was an important center of mob finances in the 1950s through 1960s. (Much of the financing for organized crime's invasion of Las Vegas came from the Teamsters Pension Fund, usually at absurdly low interest rates. Russo, p. 438, notes that Hyatt's 1972 acquisition of the Four Queens casino was financed by a loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund loan at just four percent, saving Hyatt $8 million.)

Essentially, Castle Bank pioneered the development of offshore money laundering and hiding, and served not only to launder illegally obtained money for US organized crime families, but to launder money for the CIA to fund various covert operations around the world, particularly in South America. According to Russo,

....it turned out that the Pritzkers were the largest depositors in one of the most notorious offshore tax havens ever devised, The Castle Bank of the Bahamas, which was nothing less than an intersection of the Supermob, known gangsters, pop stars, a U.S. president, and the covert branch of the CIA--all of whom had good reason to hide their money from Uncle Sam. Bahamian and Cayman Islands banks have long been valued by those wishing to hide their money because those nations absolutely refuse to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. Bank expert and author Penny Lernoux wrote of the main advantage of the Caribbean banks: ""Relying on a strict code of banking secrecy that makes Swiss banks look like blabbermouths, hundreds of banks have set up operations in the Caribbean."" To further guarantee its clients’ anonymity, Castle had arranged for Miami National Bank, which was controlled by Lansky associates, to accept the deposits, then transfer the deposit list to Castle with no names attached--only code numbers.

Agent Furfaro was among those frustrated by the government's inability to follow the money trail. ""The money was getting out of the country through Western Union,"" Furfaro recently said. ""But we weren't allowed to follow it. And the foreign banks wouldn't let us in. We had reports that money was also being shipped in railroad cars and containers placed on ships. There was so much money that they would just weigh it instead of count it....

...Given all the Pritzker associates involved in the management of Castle, it came as no surprise when Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Knut Royce determined in 1982 that the Pritzkers were in fact the bank's largest depositors. A September 1972 IRS statement noted, 'An informant [F. Eugene Poe, a former VP and director of Castle Bank] with access to the records of Castle Trust has stated that the Pritzker family of Chicago, through their Hyatt Corporation, received their initial backing from organized crime.

By 1977, IRS investigators had made things so hot for Castle Bank that it lost its banking license in the Bahamas, and moved to Panama. In April 1980, the Washington Post reported that not much more came of the IRS investigations because the CIA's Office of General Counsel warned that further pursuit of Castle ""would harm the national security."" (A scan of the Post article was online here at the time of this writing.) Russo notes that at the time the IRS investigation was terminated, the IRS Commissioner was Nixon appointee Donald Alexander, who was a senior partner in the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore, Shohl, Coates and Deupree - which law firm also had accounts with Castle Bank. Alexander either ordered or accepted the termination of the investigation into Castle Bank, despite it having already recovered $52.5 million in tax penalties.

Frontier Finance. Castle Bank. Superior Bank. If you don't see a pattern yet, Russo reports on page 521 that when the Pritzkers began to develop their Hyatt hotels in Saudi Arabia, they partnered with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), at one time the seventh largest private bank in the world. In July 1991, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and seized the branch offices of BCCI in their countries because BCCI was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes worldwide. In 1986, a US Customs undercover operation had infiltrated BCCI and found the bank actively solicited deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers, including the Medellin Cartel. Among BCCI's clients were Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe. USMC Colonel Oliver North used multiple accounts at BCCI to fund Reagan's Iran-Contra operations. And, true to the pattern, the CIA also used BCCI to finance and buy arms for the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

Maybe not all rich people are bad. Maybe there are some that made lots of money actually doing something useful. I personally don't think so. I don’t believe there are that many rich people – and I mean people in the top one percent, people with a hundred million or more, and most especially I mean billionaires – who got rich honestly and without hurting a lot of people on their way to the top. When I review the history of the Pritzker family, and its rise to political power in the person of Penny Pritzker, I think it is just the most recent example of the process the Bible describes about how a nation comes to be ruled by mean-spirited and unjust people. Then I look at the destruction of America's working class since 1980, and I see the warnings of the Bible about the disasters that befall such a nation being fulfilled.

Penny Pritzker, I’m sure, is a perfectly charming and very nice lady. I have no doubt she throws nice parties, and donates to very worthwhile charities, and is a pillar of her local community. But honestly, screw Godwin’s law: the very same was said about a lot of Germans in the 1950s who were officers and guards at Nazi death camps just a few years before. Why is it so hard to comprehend that someone can be a sweet and wonderful parent and grandparent, a rock of their church, a pillar of their community, yet make a living being the most despicably ruthless corporate banditti. I mean, who are the people who work at the banks that foreclosed on the homes of actively deployed servicemen and women? Or the people that are now overseeing the robo-signing the latest wave of fraudulent bank actions, collection of credit card debt? Maybe we don’t like to think about this; maybe we’re much more comfortable reading about the latest corporate or bankster ripoff, or corruption of our political life, or oil spill, and not actually know the people who occupy those corporate offices and cubicles day in and day out, and whose job it is that results in those ripoffs, corruption, and oil spills. Maybe it’s easier for us if we refuse to see them for who they are, and instead maintain in our mind a cartoonish caricature of a villain, with the shifty eyes, and the evil sneer, and the menacing five o’clock shadow.

But, I ask you to take a breath and think of Penny Pritzker. She was the head of a hotel chain that committed serial violations of labor law, and repeatedly, over years, systematically cheated tens of thousands of employees out of wages and benefits. And before that she directed the affairs of a bank that was among the most blatant in committing financial fraud and abuse. Is Penny Pritzker a criminal? Probably not under today's laws in the USA. We have pretty well decriminalized criminal behavior committed under a corporate guise. And now we have a new doctrine, that if there is the possibility that your enterprise is so huge and so important that its failure just might endanger the ""stability"" or the ""integrity"" of the financial system, then you will simply not be held to account. But is this the type of person you really want as your Secretary of Commerce? Is this the type of person you really want as a top adviser to the President of the United States?

Perhaps it's a good thing to let criminal families become legitimate. They hopefully are no longer committing crimes. I can assure you, this is going to be an issue many of you are going to have tpo grapple with in your own community. Just who do you think has had the money to buy real estate in inner cities and even suburbs the past five years of ""green shoots"" ""recovery""? Why, it's been your friendly neighborhood drug dealers and money launderers! Does it make a difference who are the leaders in a community? Maybe you don't think so, but it sure makes for popular movies: Frank Capra's 1946 classic, It's a Wonderful Life, in which James Stewart as bank officer George Bailey is dissuaded from suicide by an angel who shows him how debauched and evil the town becomes without his influence. Or, Robert Zemeckis' 1989 Back to the Future Part II, in which Marty and the Professor have to go back in time to stop Biff from becoming rich and totally corrupting Hill Valley. Are these just modernized fairy tales we entertain ourselves with? Or are they reflections of deeper currents of political history and social consciousness we now ignore at our peril?

Should we not be concerned about the character of our leaders at the national level as well?

To the promotion of interested Pursuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wishes, a ready sacrifice is made of the general good at the shrine of power. Then slumbers that virtuous jealousy of public men and public measures, which was wont to scrutinize not only actions but motives; then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the constitution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of resistance decreases. Thus, before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, she must be fitted for slavery by her vices.

-- Oration Delivered at Boston, March 5, 1779, by William Tudor, Esq., in On, Principles and Acts of the Revolution in America, by Hezekiah Niles, 1822.

While I am more than willing to criticize Obama about these atrocious choices for economic advisers and officials he continually makes, I would prefer people focus on the problem of the pecuniary culture of our country, rather than being distracted in a useless debate over whether or not Obama is a corporate shill or a Reaganite in disguise, or whatever. Look at it this way: what really are the political chances that someone like Bill Black or Michael Hudson will be nominated and approved for high level economic policy positions? Or, another way, why do the greediest and most selfish people, with no conception at all of the general welfare, so completely dominate economic policy making in the USA? Why, in a word, does the political culture spawned by the neo-liberal idea that market forces should dictate the destinies of nations rather than the people acting through the agency of their government, leave us with such horrible, pernicious elites? We may comfort ourselves by thinking our elites are merely incompetent, or even greedy and corrupt, but I have reached the conclusion that such analyses is dangerous as it does not strike at the criminal essence of our elites.

The older I get, the more bruises I suffer toiling to accumulate wisdom, the more I come to appreciate what an excellent book the Bible is. Penny Pritzker, oppressor of labor, smasher of unions, exploiter of the poor, consort of criminals. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” the Bible counsels. Tell me, please, exactly what policies do you expect a person like Penny Pritzker to champion? Will they be policies that help working men and women? Please, tell me.

No, wait, I don’t need to be told. Tell yourself."

Palast wrote:\n\nPritzker’s net worth is listed in Forbes as $1.8 billion, which is one hell of a heavy magic wand in the world of politics. Her wand would have been heavier, and her net worth higher, except that in 2001, the federal government fined her and her family $460 million for the predatory, deceitful, racist tactics and practices of Superior, the bank-and-loan-shark operation she ran on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nSuperior was the first of the deregulated go-go banks to go bust – at the time, the costliest failure ever. US taxpayers lost nearly half a billion dollars. Superior’s depositors lost millions and poor folk in Sen. Obama’s South Side district lost their homes.\n\nThere were also a couple diaries on DailyKos, including by front pager Laura Clawson, who called attention to Pritzker\'s and her family\'s role in Hyatt Hotels, which has compiled what may be the worst records of labor abuses in the hotel industry.

In the 1960s, following Giancana\'s rise to the day-to-day ""boss"" position in the Outfit, Buccieri served as a top enforcer and personal hitman. He was also involved in labor racketeering bombing, arson and loan sharking.\n\nAs a loan shark, Buccieri would send his men to stake out employment offices. These thugs would pass out business cards to the unemployed that listed Buccieri as a, ""loan officer."" The mob generally viewed unemployed workers as poor loan prospects; however, Buccieri was so effective at intimidating his ""juice,"" or ""loan interest,"" victims that they would steal or rob to pay him off. Buccieri would often warn friends of a ""juice"" victim not to ride around with him, ""because he is going to get hit."" When the victim heard this warning, he would quickly pay up.\n\nIt is not clear whether Fiore Buccieri\'s ""sales pitches"" at employment offices fed ""clients"" to his brother\'s (and Pritzker\'s) Frontier Finance, but that is a reasonable assumption. Buccieri used a warehouse where he would hang his victims on a meathook (maybe Hollywood got this gruseome idea from its mob connections?), the most infamous such murder was that of loanshark William ""Action"" Jackson, in 1961. After being arrested while unloading a truck of stolen radios then released, rumor spread within the Outfit that Jackson had become an FBI informant. Buccieri and two others hung the 300-pound Jackson on a meat hook and tortured him with ice picks, baseball bats, a blow torch and an electric cattle prod for nearly three days, until Jackson finally died. Federal authorities later obtained details of Jackson\'s murder from conversations overheard between Buccieri and one of the other murderers.\n\nBut, you object, so far all we have is guilt by association. Uh, yeah. Get over it. In fact, learn to use it. You want a criminal indictment or conviction? Ain\'t going to happen. Not for the most successful criminals. As Russo quotes John P. Barnes, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois from the 1930s top 1950s: “The Syndicate could not operate without the approval of the [State\'s Attorney\'s] office.... The relationship between the State\'s Attorney\'s office, and Capone\'s Syndicate, under [Tom] Courtney and [Dan] Gilbert, was such that during the entire period that Courtney was in office [1932-44], no Syndicate man was ever convicted of a major crime in Cook County.""\n\nA specialty developed and refined by the Chicago Outfit was labor racketeering. Al Capone\'s very own lawyer, Abe Teitelbaum got the bar rolling when he was ""hired\' as the attorney for the Chicago Bar and Restaurant Association in 1932. As the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the McClellan Committee) stated in its final report in 1950, the Association, under the counsel of Teitelbaum, functioned ""principally to to defeat and destroy legitimate unionization and has callously and calculatedly used men with underworld connections to make collusive arrangements with dishonest union officials.""\n\nTeitelbaum\'s labor racketeering became of forte of Sidney Korshak, who would become a key Pritzker associate. Russo writes that\n\nIn the case of unions not directly under the mob\'s control, it was often just a simple matter of paying off the union bosses to persuade them to accept a substandard deal, a modus operandi adopted by Sid Korshak. ""He made cash payoffs to business agents - five thousand dollars here, three thousand dollars there,"" said Leo Geffner, a Los Angeles attorney who negotiated with Korshak years later. ""I know that. That\'s the way it was--to keep labor peace, you\'d find a corrupt business agent and pay him off."" Of course, in doing so, the racketeer stabbed both the workers and their employers in the back. Ironically, this was the very abuse suffered by Korshak\'s grandparents in Kiev. The ever-vigiulent Korshak gadfly, Lester Velie, succinctly described [in Readers Digest in 1957] how the treachery worked: ""The deal may be to bring a ""friendly"" union in, or to keep a union out, or to accept substandard wages.... In the deals that the go-between arranges, the union\'s function is perverted. Instead of serving as an instrument to win better wages and working conditions, it becomes a tool for keeping the worker in line. Thus it performs the same function as the unions do in Communist Russia.""\n\nWhat do you think? Would it be impolite to ask Penny Pritizker, in her confirmation hearings, about her grandfather\'s relations to organized crime? Is it impolite to ask her if her ideas about suppressing workers wages are in any way informed or influenced by the role of her grandfather\'s associates in smashing and corrupting unions? It does seem to be a tradition in her family.\n\nIs it impolite to ask about the similarities in the business models of Frontier Finance in the 1950s and Superior Bank in the 1990s? And is Penny Pritzker now willing, without hesitation, to condemn the type of banking practices that seem to be another family tradition among the Pritzkers? Back in February 2008, Dennis Bernstein reported, in Obama\'s Sub-Prime Conflict,\n\nThough Superior Bank collapsed years before the current sub-prime turmoil that is rocking the world’s financial markets – and pushing those millions of homeowners toward foreclosure – some banking experts say the Pritzkers and Superior hold a special place in the history of the sub-prime fiasco.\n\n“The [sub-prime] financial engineering that created the Wall Street meltdown was developed by the Pritzkers and Ernst and Young, working with Merrill Lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub-prime mortgages,” Timothy J. Anderson, a whistleblower on financial and bank fraud, told me in an interview.\n\n“The sub-prime mortgages,” Anderson said, “were provided to Merrill Lynch, by a nation-wide Pritzker origination system, using Superior as the cash cow, with many millions in FDIC insured deposits. Superior’s owners were to sub-prime lending, what Michael Milken was to junk bonds”\n\nIn other words, if you traced today’s sub-prime crisis back to its origins, you would come upon the\nrole of the Pritzkers and Superior Bank of Chicago.... When it collapsed in 2001, Superior Bank represented the largest failure of a U.S.-insured depository institution for a decade.\n\n“The failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to the Bank’s Board of Directors and executives ignoring sound risk management principles,” said FDIC Inspector General Gaston Gianni Jr. in a Feb. 7, 2002, report.\n\nBanking whistleblower Anderson noted that “Superior failed at a time of historically low interest rates, high employment, a strong economy, and a growing housing market.… There was no reason for it to fail unless you consider gross negligence, a flawed business plan, and a conspiracy to deceive the regulators who were clearly asleep and were negligent themselves in their duties of protecting the class of underinsured depositors.”\n\nA few voices the past few weeks have raised the issue of Hyatt Hotels and Superior Bank, but this past week, Rick Perlstein\'s two-part article in The Nation, raised an even more troubling chapter of Pritzker history: the family\'s connection to Castle Bank of the Bahamas. According to Russo (pages 439 ff.) Castle Bank was the granddaddy of offshore money laundering and tax evasion. Castle Bank was set up in 1964 by former senior Office of Strategic Services officer Paul Helliwell, who had become an important cutout for hiding CIA funds; Morris Kleinman of the Cleveland organized crime family headed by Moe Dalitz; Burton Kanter, a tax attorney for the Pritzkers, and a board member of Hyatt; and Stanford Clinton, a partner in grandpa Pritzker\'s law firm, and a trustee of the Teamsters Pension Fund, which was an important center of mob finances in the 1950s through 1960s. (Much of the financing for organized crime\'s invasion of Las Vegas came from the Teamsters Pension Fund, usually at absurdly low interest rates. Russo, p. 438, notes that Hyatt\'s 1972 acquisition of the Four Queens casino was financed by a loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund loan at just four percent, saving Hyatt $8 million.)\n\nEssentially, Castle Bank pioneered the development of offshore money laundering and hiding, and served not only to launder illegally obtained money for US organized crime families, but to launder money for the CIA to fund various covert operations around the world, particularly in South America. According to Russo,\n\n....it turned out that the Pritzkers were the largest depositors in one of the most notorious offshore tax havens ever devised, The Castle Bank of the Bahamas, which was nothing less than an intersection of the Supermob, known gangsters, pop stars, a U.S. president, and the covert branch of the CIA--all of whom had good reason to hide their money from Uncle Sam. Bahamian and Cayman Islands banks have long been valued by those wishing to hide their money because those nations absolutely refuse to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. Bank expert and author Penny Lernoux wrote of the main advantage of the Caribbean banks: ""Relying on a strict code of banking secrecy that makes Swiss banks look like blabbermouths, hundreds of banks have set up operations in the Caribbean."" To further guarantee its clients’ anonymity, Castle had arranged for Miami National Bank, which was controlled by Lansky associates, to accept the deposits, then transfer the deposit list to Castle with no names attached--only code numbers.\n\nAgent Furfaro was among those frustrated by the government\'s inability to follow the money trail. ""The money was getting out of the country through Western Union,"" Furfaro recently said. ""But we weren\'t allowed to follow it. And the foreign banks wouldn\'t let us in. We had reports that money was also being shipped in railroad cars and containers placed on ships. There was so much money that they would just weigh it instead of count it....\n\n...Given all the Pritzker associates involved in the management of Castle, it came as no surprise when Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Knut Royce determined in 1982 that the Pritzkers were in fact the bank\'s largest depositors. A September 1972 IRS statement noted, \'An informant [F. Eugene Poe, a former VP and director of Castle Bank] with access to the records of Castle Trust has stated that the Pritzker family of Chicago, through their Hyatt Corporation, received their initial backing from organized crime.\n\nBy 1977, IRS investigators had made things so hot for Castle Bank that it lost its banking license in the Bahamas, and moved to Panama. In April 1980, the Washington Post reported that not much more came of the IRS investigations because the CIA\'s Office of General Counsel warned that further pursuit of Castle ""would harm the national security."" (A scan of the Post article was online here at the time of this writing.) Russo notes that at the time the IRS investigation was terminated, the IRS Commissioner was Nixon appointee Donald Alexander, who was a senior partner in the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore, Shohl, Coates and Deupree - which law firm also had accounts with Castle Bank. Alexander either ordered or accepted the termination of the investigation into Castle Bank, despite it having already recovered $52.5 million in tax penalties.\n\nFrontier Finance. Castle Bank. Superior Bank. If you don\'t see a pattern yet, Russo reports on page 521 that when the Pritzkers began to develop their Hyatt hotels in Saudi Arabia, they partnered with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), at one time the seventh largest private bank in the world. In July 1991, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and seized the branch offices of BCCI in their countries because BCCI was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes worldwide. In 1986, a US Customs undercover operation had infiltrated BCCI and found the bank actively solicited deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers, including the Medellin Cartel. Among BCCI\'s clients were Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe. USMC Colonel Oliver North used multiple accounts at BCCI to fund Reagan\'s Iran-Contra operations. And, true to the pattern, the CIA also used BCCI to finance and buy arms for the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nMaybe not all rich people are bad. Maybe there are some that made lots of money actually doing something useful. I personally don\'t think so. I don’t believe there are that many rich people – and I mean people in the top one percent, people with a hundred million or more, and most especially I mean billionaires – who got rich honestly and without hurting a lot of people on their way to the top. When I review the history of the Pritzker family, and its rise to political power in the person of Penny Pritzker, I think it is just the most recent example of the process the Bible describes about how a nation comes to be ruled by mean-spirited and unjust people. Then I look at the destruction of America\'s working class since 1980, and I see the warnings of the Bible about the disasters that befall such a nation being fulfilled.\n\nPenny Pritzker, I’m sure, is a perfectly charming and very nice lady. I have no doubt she throws nice parties, and donates to very worthwhile charities, and is a pillar of her local community. But honestly, screw Godwin’s law: the very same was said about a lot of Germans in the 1950s who were officers and guards at Nazi death camps just a few years before. Why is it so hard to comprehend that someone can be a sweet and wonderful parent and grandparent, a rock of their church, a pillar of their community, yet make a living being the most despicably ruthless corporate banditti. I mean, who are the people who work at the banks that foreclosed on the homes of actively deployed servicemen and women? Or the people that are now overseeing the robo-signing the latest wave of fraudulent bank actions, collection of credit card debt? Maybe we don’t like to think about this; maybe we’re much more comfortable reading about the latest corporate or bankster ripoff, or corruption of our political life, or oil spill, and not actually know the people who occupy those corporate offices and cubicles day in and day out, and whose job it is that results in those ripoffs, corruption, and oil spills. Maybe it’s easier for us if we refuse to see them for who they are, and instead maintain in our mind a cartoonish caricature of a villain, with the shifty eyes, and the evil sneer, and the menacing five o’clock shadow.\n\nBut, I ask you to take a breath and think of Penny Pritzker. She was the head of a hotel chain that committed serial violations of labor law, and repeatedly, over years, systematically cheated tens of thousands of employees out of wages and benefits. And before that she directed the affairs of a bank that was among the most blatant in committing financial fraud and abuse. Is Penny Pritzker a criminal? Probably not under today\'s laws in the USA. We have pretty well decriminalized criminal behavior committed under a corporate guise. And now we have a new doctrine, that if there is the possibility that your enterprise is so huge and so important that its failure just might endanger the ""stability"" or the ""integrity"" of the financial system, then you will simply not be held to account. But is this the type of person you really want as your Secretary of Commerce? Is this the type of person you really want as a top adviser to the President of the United States?\n\nPerhaps it\'s a good thing to let criminal families become legitimate. They hopefully are no longer committing crimes. I can assure you, this is going to be an issue many of you are going to have tpo grapple with in your own community. Just who do you think has had the money to buy real estate in inner cities and even suburbs the past five years of ""green shoots"" ""recovery""? Why, it\'s been your friendly neighborhood drug dealers and money launderers! Does it make a difference who are the leaders in a community? Maybe you don\'t think so, but it sure makes for popular movies: Frank Capra\'s 1946 classic, It\'s a Wonderful Life, in which James Stewart as bank officer George Bailey is dissuaded from suicide by an angel who shows him how debauched and evil the town becomes without his influence. Or, Robert Zemeckis\' 1989 Back to the Future Part II, in which Marty and the Professor have to go back in time to stop Biff from becoming rich and totally corrupting Hill Valley. Are these just modernized fairy tales we entertain ourselves with? Or are they reflections of deeper currents of political history and social consciousness we now ignore at our peril?\n\nShould we not be concerned about the character of our leaders at the national level as well?\n\nTo the promotion of interested Pursuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wishes, a ready sacrifice is made of the general good at the shrine of power. Then slumbers that virtuous jealousy of public men and public measures, which was wont to scrutinize not only actions but motives; then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the constitution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of resistance decreases. Thus, before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, she must be fitted for slavery by her vices.\n\n-- Oration Delivered at Boston, March 5, 1779, by William Tudor, Esq., in On, Principles and Acts of the Revolution in America, by Hezekiah Niles, 1822.\n\nWhile I am more than willing to criticize Obama about these atrocious choices for economic advisers and officials he continually makes, I would prefer people focus on the problem of the pecuniary culture of our country, rather than being distracted in a useless debate over whether or not Obama is a corporate shill or a Reaganite in disguise, or whatever. Look at it this way: what really are the political chances that someone like Bill Black or Michael Hudson will be nominated and approved for high level economic policy positions? Or, another way, why do the greediest and most selfish people, with no conception at all of the general welfare, so completely dominate economic policy making in the USA? Why, in a word, does the political culture spawned by the neo-liberal idea that market forces should dictate the destinies of nations rather than the people acting through the agency of their government, leave us with such horrible, pernicious elites? We may comfort ourselves by thinking our elites are merely incompetent, or even greedy and corrupt, but I have reached the conclusion that such analyses is dangerous as it does not strike at the criminal essence of our elites.\n\nThe older I get, the more bruises I suffer toiling to accumulate wisdom, the more I come to appreciate what an excellent book the Bible is. Penny Pritzker, oppressor of labor, smasher of unions, exploiter of the poor, consort of criminals. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” the Bible counsels. Tell me, please, exactly what policies do you expect a person like Penny Pritzker to champion? Will they be policies that help working men and women? Please, tell me.\n\nNo, wait, I don’t need to be told.

Incredibly - perhaps I should write, sadly - the announcement is causing hardly a stir among the liberal and progressive blogosphere. At the very least, Greg Palast\'s May 4, 2013 post at Smirking Chimp, <a href=""http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/greg-palast/49397/billionaire-bankster-breaks-into-obama-s-cabinet"">Billionaire Bankster Breaks into Obama’s Cabinet</a>, \xa0should be going viral.

How the police chief\'s kids got really good paying jobs because the chief would not make too many inquiries about (in other words, would remain deliberately uninformed, ignorant, and unaware) the prostitution on the West Side; or the numbers racket along the riverfront; or the freight pilferage at the airport. How the mayor\'s wife was able to drive around in a brand new Cadillac because a certain tract of land had been quietly rezoned, to the advantage a mayoral crony. Such petty corruption used to be the stock in trade of good local investigative reporters at big metropolitan newspapers, back in a nearly forgotten era when FCC rules made it nearly impossible for one or two corporate behemoths to own every major newspaper, radio station, and television station in one city.<br></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=""row"">\n<div class=""col-sm-12"">\n<div id=""read-more""></div>\n<div class=""story-intro-divider""></div>\n<div class=""story-body story-content"">\n<p>Many of you already know that I used to be an economics correspondent, and that I burned out and became depressed watching Wall Street have its way in the early 1990s in what was called, back then, ""off balance sheet liabilities"" (what we today call ""financial derivatives"" - the stuff, like credit default swaps, that blew up in 2007 through 2008, and left a dismaying amount of the world\'s economy in ashes). Well, that\'s not really the whole truth. About what got me depressed, that is. So, tonight, you\'re going to learn a bit more of the truth. You\'re going to learn some of the dark, frightful secrets hidden away in my memory; stuff I usually don\'t mention, because it makes a lot of people <i>very uncomfortable</i>. \xa0</p>\n<p>In a word, the <i>mob</i>. Organized crime. The syndicate. In Chicago, it was called <i>the Outfit</i>. But every major city had its own crime family, or branch thereof. You see, part of what I researched and wrote about in that depressing period of nearly a quarter century ago was how the billions of dollars, nay, <i>hundreds of billions</i> of dollars that were fueling what was politely called <i>mergers and acquisitions</i>, most especially including leveraged buy outs, came from, not entirely, but in large part, organized crime. That included hundreds of billions of dollars that the <a href=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/166517NCJRS.pdf"">Wall Street banks laundered from illegal narcotics trafficking</a>, including heroin and cocaine. \xa0The beginnings of financial derivatives were closely tied to the mob going legit.</p>\n<p>So, the Reagan regime of deregulation was really a double whammy. It basically decriminalized the worst behavior of banks and corporations, at the very time that some of the most immoral, ruthless, indeed murderous, people in America were buying legitimacy for themselves and their heirs by seizing control, through brazen manipulation of debt and stock markets, of America\'s industrial companies.</p>\n<p>The story of the hour is Penny Pritzker becoming Secretary of Commerce. So, tonight, you\'re going to learn about the Pritizker family and its fortune. I suspect that it\'s probably more than you want to know.</p>\n<p>The origins of the Pritzker family fortune was her grandfather\'s mob connections when he was a tax attorney for a lot of people in ""The Outfit,"" the Chicago mob, beginning under Al Capone, and continuing through the 1980s. This connection to organized crime was reportedly what financed the creation of Hyatt Hotels by Penny\'s father. There was no crime involved, but the financial backing came from organized crime, plain and simple. \xa0The details are in Gus Russo\'s 2006 tome <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Supermob-Korshak-Criminal-Associates-Americas/dp/B001FA23R2"">Supermob: How Sidney Korshak and His Criminal Associates Became America\'s Hidden Power Brokers</a>. Russo\'s book is crucial reading for anyone trying to understand why America\'s ruling elites are, well, so <i>bad</i>.</p>\n<p>It\'s not really a matter of incompetence or ineptitude. Rather, it is a \xa0case study in how the republican (small ""r"", not capital ""R"" as in the Republican Party, or GOP - greedy old pricks) ideals of public virtue, the general welfare, and economic and political equality, are forgotten and eventually undermined by allowing a criminal class to become legitimate and amass political and economic influence. The story of the Pritzker family is an all-American story, of how a family with ties to organized crime amasses a great fortune while striving relentlessly for legitimacy, and arrives at the pinnacle of economic and political power in America. Chris Hedges is not exaggerating when he <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/09/chris-hedges-occupy-wall-street-is-where-the-hope-of-america-lies/"">states that</a> ""the criminal class in this country has seized power.""</p>\n<p>This ascent to America\'s summits is an oft-trod trek, pioneered by Boston and Newport maritime merchants who parlayed opium and millions of ruined lives in China into wealth, respectability, and power in the 1800s. Many of the mercantile banks established along the way are \xa0still with us, brightened and prettified by numerous changes in corporate branding. The one constant is the ruthless concentration on private gain. The extent to which that concentration on private gain is tempered and ameliorated by fleeting notions of public service provides the cracks and crevices in which the ebb and flow of history eddy and swirl. \xa0</p>\n<p>Now, you can point to the Kennedy family as an example of ill-begotten gains leading to some very good minded public service. But <a href=""http://org2.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=qxdTh40W95P%2BlywDB2hYK33wNl4%2FZnQ3"">Penny Pritzker\'s roles at Hyatt and Superior Bank are, to say the least, highly troubling</a>, and cast doubt on the idea that she may be anywhere near as mindful of the general welfare as John, Bobby, and Edward Kennedy were. Instead of public service, the tradition in the Pritzker family seems focused on economic exploitation of others, skirting the law as much as possible, and shady dealings. There is a strong tradition in the Pritzker family of outright money laundering and offshore tax evasion.</p>\n<p>Before Superior Bank, the Pritzkers controlled Frontier Finance, a loan company in Chicago that one source told Russo ""is believed to be the secret to the origins of the family\'s involvement with criminals."" The president of Frontier Finance was Frank Buccieri. And Buccieri\'s brother was the greatly feared ""collector"" for the Outfit, Fiore ""Fifi"" Buccieri, who Life magazine in May 1969 termed ""<span class=""st"">leader of [Sam] Giancana\'s assassination squads</span>."" The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiore_Buccieri"">Wikipedia entry on Fiori Buccieri</a> is chilling:</p>\n<blockquote>During \xa0the bootleg wars of Prohibition, Buccieri was reportedly involved in at least 10 gangland slayings. In the 1960s, following Giancana\'s rise to the day-to-day ""boss"" position in the Outfit, Buccieri served as a top enforcer and personal hitman. He was also involved in labor racketeering \xa0bombing, arson and loan sharking.\n<p>As a loan shark, Buccieri would send his men to stake out employment offices. These thugs would pass out business cards to the unemployed that listed Buccieri as a, ""loan officer."" The mob generally viewed unemployed workers as poor loan prospects; however, Buccieri was so effective at intimidating his ""juice,"" or ""loan interest,"" victims that they would steal or rob to pay him off. Buccieri would often warn friends of a ""juice"" victim not to ride around with him, ""because he is going to get hit."" When the victim heard this warning, he would quickly pay up.</p>\n</blockquote>\nIt is not clear whether Fiore Buccieri\'s ""sales pitches"" at employment offices fed ""clients"" to his brother\'s (and Pritzker\'s) Frontier Finance, but that is a reasonable assumption. Buccieri used a warehouse where he would hang his victims on a meathook (maybe Hollywood got this gruseome idea from its mob connections?), the most infamous such murder was that of loanshark William ""Action"" Jackson, in 1961. After being arrested while unloading a truck of stolen radios then released, rumor spread within the Outfit that Jackson had become an FBI informant. \xa0Buccieri and two others hung the 300-pound Jackson on a meat hook and tortured him with ice picks, baseball bats, a blow torch and an electric cattle prod for nearly three days, until Jackson finally died. Federal authorities later obtained details of Jackson\'s murder from conversations overheard between Buccieri and one of the other murderers. \xa0\n<p>But, you object, so far all we have is guilt by association. Uh, yeah. Get over it. In fact, learn to use it. You want a criminal indictment or conviction? Ain\'t going to happen. Not for the most successful criminals. As Russo quotes John P. Barnes, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois from the 1930s top 1950s: “The Syndicate could not operate without the approval of the [State\'s Attorney\'s] office.... The relationship between the State\'s Attorney\'s office, and Capone\'s Syndicate, under [Tom] Courtney and [Dan] Gilbert, was such that during the entire period that Courtney was in office [1932-44], no Syndicate man was ever convicted of a major crime in Cook County.""</p>\n<p>A specialty developed and refined by the Chicago Outfit was labor racketeering. Al Capone\'s very own lawyer, Abe Teitelbaum got the bar rolling when he was ""hired\' as the attorney for the Chicago Bar and Restaurant Association in 1932. As the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Improper_Activities_in_Labor_and_Management"">U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management</a> (also known as the McClellan Committee) stated in its final report in 1950, the Association, under the counsel of Teitelbaum, functioned ""principally to to defeat and destroy legitimate unionization and has callously and calculatedly used men with underworld connections to make collusive arrangements with dishonest union officials.""</p>\n<p>Teitelbaum\'s labor racketeering became of forte of Sidney Korshak, who would become a key Pritzker associate. Russo writes that</p>\n<blockquote>In the case of unions not directly under the mob\'s control, it was often just a simple matter of paying off the union bosses to persuade them to accept a substandard deal, a modus operandi adopted by Sid Korshak. ""He made cash payoffs to business agents - five thousand dollars here, three thousand dollars there,"" said Leo Geffner, a Los Angeles attorney who negotiated with Korshak years later. ""I <i>know</i> that. That\'s the way it was--to keep labor peace, you\'d find a corrupt business agent and pay him off."" Of course, in doing so, the racketeer stabbed both the workers and their employers in the back. Ironically, this was the very abuse suffered by Korshak\'s grandparents in Kiev. The ever-vigiulent Korshak gadfly, Lester Velie, succinctly described [in <i>Readers Digest</i> in 1957] how the treachery worked: ""The deal may be to bring a ""friendly"" union in, or to keep a union out, or to accept substandard wages.... In the deals that the go-between arranges, the union\'s function is perverted. Instead of serving as an instrument to win better wages and working conditions, it becomes a tool for keeping the worker in line. Thus it performs the same function as the unions do in Communist Russia.""</blockquote>\nWhat do you think? Would it be impolite to ask Penny Pritizker, in her confirmation hearings, about her grandfather\'s relations to organized crime? Is it impolite to ask her if her ideas about suppressing workers wages are in any way informed or influenced by the role of her grandfather\'s associates in smashing and corrupting unions? It does seem to be a tradition in her family.\n<p>Is it impolite to ask about the similarities in the business models of \xa0Frontier Finance in the 1950s and Superior Bank in the 1990s? And is Penny Pritzker now willing, without hesitation, to condemn the type of banking practices that seem to be another family tradition among the Pritzkers? \xa0Back in February 2008, Dennis Bernstein reported, in <a href=""http://www.consortiumnews.com/2008/022708a.html"">Obama\'s Sub-Prime Conflict</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>Though Superior Bank collapsed years before the current sub-prime turmoil that is rocking the world’s financial markets – and pushing those millions of homeowners toward foreclosure – some banking experts say the Pritzkers and Superior hold a special place \xa0in the history of the sub-prime fiasco.\n<p>“The [sub-prime] financial engineering that created the Wall Street meltdown was developed by the Pritzkers and Ernst and Young, working with Merrill Lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub-prime mortgages,” Timothy J. Anderson, a whistleblower on financial and bank fraud, told me in an interview.</p>\n<p>“The sub-prime mortgages,” Anderson \xa0said, “were provided to Merrill Lynch, by a nation-wide Pritzker origination system, using Superior as the cash cow, with many millions in FDIC insured deposits. Superior’s owners were to sub-prime lending, what Michael Milken was to junk bonds”</p>\n<p>In other words, if you traced today’s sub-prime crisis back to its origins, you would come upon the<br>\nrole of the Pritzkers and Superior Bank of Chicago.... When it collapsed in 2001, Superior Bank represented the largest failure of a U.S.-insured depository institution for a decade.</p>\n<p>“The failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to the Bank’s Board of Directors and executives ignoring sound risk management principles,” said FDIC Inspector General Gaston Gianni Jr. in a Feb. 7, 2002, report.</p>\n<p>Banking whistleblower Anderson noted that “Superior failed at a time of historically low interest rates, high employment, a strong economy, and a growing housing market.… There was no reason for it to fail unless you consider gross negligence, a flawed business plan, and a conspiracy to deceive the regulators who were clearly asleep and were negligent themselves in their duties of protecting the class of underinsured depositors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\nA few voices the past few weeks have raised the issue of Hyatt Hotels and Superior Bank, but this past week, <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/174197/penny-pritzkers-commerce-part-two"">Rick Perlstein\'s two-part article in <i>The Nation</i></a>, raised an even more troubling chapter of Pritzker history: \xa0the family\'s connection to Castle Bank of the Bahamas. According to \xa0Russo (pages 439 ff.) Castle Bank was the granddaddy of offshore money laundering and tax evasion. Castle Bank was set up in 1964 by former senior Office of Strategic Services officer <a href=""http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKhelliwell.htm"">Paul Helliwell</a>, who had become an important cutout for hiding CIA funds; Morris Kleinman of the Cleveland organized crime family headed by Moe Dalitz; Burton Kanter, a tax attorney for the Pritzkers, and a board member of Hyatt; and Stanford Clinton, a partner in grandpa Pritzker\'s law firm, and a trustee of the <a href=""http://www.laborers.org/Commission_IBT.html"">Teamsters Pension Fund, which was an important center of mob finances</a> in the 1950s through 1960s. (Much of the financing for organized crime\'s invasion of Las Vegas came from the Teamsters Pension Fund, usually at absurdly low interest rates. Russo, p. 438, notes that Hyatt\'s 1972 acquisition of the Four Queens casino was financed by a loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund loan at just four percent, saving Hyatt $8 million.)\n<p>Essentially, Castle Bank pioneered the development of offshore money laundering and hiding, and served not only to launder illegally obtained money for US organized crime families, but to launder money for the CIA to fund various covert operations around the world, particularly in South America. According to Russo,</p>\n<blockquote>....it turned out that the Pritzkers were the largest depositors in one of the most notorious offshore tax havens ever devised, The Castle Bank of the Bahamas, which was nothing less than an intersection of the Supermob, known gangsters, pop stars, a U.S. president, and the covert branch of the CIA--all of whom had good reason to hide their money from Uncle Sam. Bahamian and Cayman Islands banks have long been valued by those wishing to hide their money because those nations absolutely refuse to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. Bank expert and author Penny Lernoux wrote of the main advantage of the Caribbean banks: ""Relying on a strict code of banking secrecy that makes Swiss banks look like blabbermouths, hundreds of banks have set up operations in the Caribbean."" To further guarantee its clients’ anonymity, Castle had arranged for Miami National Bank, which was controlled by Lansky associates, to accept the deposits, then transfer the deposit list to Castle with no names attached--only code numbers.\n<p>Agent Furfaro was among those frustrated by the government\'s inability to follow the money trail. ""The money was getting out of the country through Western Union,"" Furfaro recently said. ""But we weren\'t allowed to follow it. \xa0And the foreign banks wouldn\'t let us in. We had reports that money was also being shipped in railroad cars and containers placed on ships. There was so much money that they would just weigh it instead of count it....</p>\n<p>...Given all the Pritzker associates involved in the management of Castle, it came as no surprise when Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Knut Royce determined in 1982 that the Pritzkers were in fact the bank\'s largest depositors. A September 1972 IRS statement noted, \'An informant [F. Eugene Poe, a former VP and director of Castle Bank] with access to the records of Castle Trust has stated that the Pritzker family of Chicago, through their Hyatt Corporation, received their initial backing from organized crime.</p>\n</blockquote>\nBy 1977, IRS investigators had made things so hot for Castle Bank that it lost its banking license in the Bahamas, and moved to Panama. In April 1980, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that not much more came of the IRS investigations because the CIA\'s Office of General Counsel warned that further pursuit of Castle ""would harm the national security."" (A scan of the <i>Post</i> article was <a href=""http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/C%20Disk/CIA%20Assets%20and%20Appropriations/Item%2010.pdf"">online here</a> at the time of this writing.) Russo notes that at the time the IRS investigation was terminated, the IRS Commissioner was Nixon appointee Donald Alexander, who was a senior partner in the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore, Shohl, Coates and Deupree - which law firm also had accounts with Castle Bank. Alexander either ordered or accepted the termination of the investigation into Castle Bank, despite it having already recovered $52.5 million in tax penalties.\n<p>Frontier Finance. Castle Bank. Superior Bank. If you don\'t see a pattern yet, Russo reports on page 521 that when the Pritzkers began to develop their Hyatt hotels in Saudi Arabia, they partnered with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International"">Bank of Credit and Commerce International</a> (BCCI), at one time the seventh largest private bank in the world. In July 1991, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and seized the branch offices of BCCI in their countries because BCCI was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes worldwide. In 1986, a US Customs undercover operation had infiltrated BCCI and found the bank actively solicited deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers, including the Medellin Cartel. Among BCCI\'s clients were Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe. USMC Colonel Oliver North used multiple accounts at BCCI to fund Reagan\'s Iran-Contra operations. And, true to the pattern, the CIA also used BCCI to finance and buy arms for the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. \xa0</p>\n<p>Maybe not all rich people are bad. Maybe there are some that made lots of money actually doing something useful. I personally don\'t think so. I don’t believe there are that many rich people – and I mean people in the top one percent, people with a hundred million or more, and most especially I mean billionaires – who got rich honestly and without hurting a lot of people on their way to the top. When I review the history of the Pritzker family, and its rise to political power in the person of Penny Pritzker, I think it is just the most recent example of the process the Bible describes about how a nation comes to be ruled by mean-spirited and unjust people. Then I look at the destruction of America\'s working class since 1980, and I see the warnings of the Bible about the disasters that befall such a nation being fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Penny Pritzker, I’m sure, is a perfectly charming and very nice lady. I have no doubt she throws nice parties, and donates to very worthwhile charities, and is a pillar of her local community. But honestly, screw Godwin’s law: the very same was said about a lot of Germans in the 1950s who were officers and guards at Nazi death camps just a few years before. Why is it so hard to comprehend that someone can be a sweet and wonderful parent and grandparent, a rock of their church, a pillar of their community, yet make a living being the most despicably ruthless corporate banditti. I mean, who are the people who work at the banks that foreclosed on the homes of actively deployed servicemen and women? Or the people that are now overseeing the robo-signing the latest wave of <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/economy/vicious-new-bank-shakedown-could-seriously-ruin-your-life?akid=10451.103280.rOtZ8F&amp;rd=1&amp;src=newsletter841937&amp;t=7&amp;paging=off"">fraudulent bank actions, collection of credit card debt</a>? Maybe we don’t like to think about this; maybe we’re much more comfortable reading about the latest corporate or bankster ripoff, or corruption of our political life, or oil spill, and not actually know the people who occupy those corporate offices and cubicles day in and day out, and whose job it is that results in those ripoffs, corruption, and oil spills. Maybe it’s easier for us if we refuse to see them for who they are, and instead maintain in our mind a cartoonish caricature of a villain, with the shifty eyes, and the evil sneer, and the menacing five o’clock shadow.</p>\n<p>But, I ask you to take a breath and think of Penny Pritzker. She was the head of a hotel chain that committed serial violations of labor law, and repeatedly, over years, systematically cheated tens of thousands of employees out of wages and benefits. And before that she directed the affairs of a bank that was among the most blatant in committing financial fraud and abuse. Is Penny Pritzker a criminal? Probably not under today\'s laws in the USA. We have pretty well decriminalized criminal behavior committed under a corporate guise. And now we have a new doctrine, that if there is the possibility that your enterprise is so huge and so important that its failure just might endanger the ""stability"" or the ""integrity"" of the financial system, then you will simply not be held to account. But is this the type of person you really want as your Secretary of Commerce? Is this the type of person you really want as a top adviser to the President of the United States?</p>\n<p>Perhaps it\'s a good thing to let criminal families become legitimate. They hopefully are no longer committing crimes. I can assure you, this is going to be an issue many of you are going to have tpo grapple with in your own community. Just who do you think has had the money to buy real estate in inner cities and even suburbs the past five years of ""green shoots"" ""recovery""? Why, it\'s been your friendly neighborhood drug dealers and money launderers! Does it make a difference who are the leaders in a community? Maybe you don\'t think so, but it sure makes for popular movies: Frank Capra\'s 1946 classic, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life"">It\'s a Wonderful Life</a>, in which James Stewart as bank officer George Bailey is dissuaded from suicide by an angel who shows him how debauched and evil the town becomes without his influence. Or, Robert Zemeckis\' 1989 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II"">Back to the Future Part II</a>, in which Marty and the Professor have to go back in time to stop Biff from becoming rich and totally corrupting Hill Valley. Are these just modernized fairy tales we entertain ourselves with? Or are they reflections of deeper currents of political history and social consciousness we now ignore at our peril?</p>\n<p>Should we not be concerned about the character of our leaders at the national level as well?<br></p>\n<blockquote>To the promotion of interested Pursuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wishes, a ready sacrifice is made of the general good at the shrine of power. Then slumbers that virtuous jealousy of public men and public measures, which was wont to scrutinize not only actions but motives; then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the constitution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of resistance decreases. Thus, before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, she must be fitted for slavery by her vices.\n<p>-- Oration Delivered at Boston, March 5, 1779, by William Tudor, Esq., in <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%2Fabout%2FRepublication_of_the_Principles_and_acts.html%3Fid%3DSVvUAAAAMAAJ&amp;ei=ZITOTofDCcrDgQfV9PHBDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEheLs9jUSXzFWsqIR_vHNWnFc1OA&amp;sig2=IQ07Vi4-E-IGFxwH-uliAg"">On, Principles and Acts of the Revolution in America, by Hezekiah Niles</a>, 1822.</p>\n</blockquote>\nWhile I am more than willing to criticize Obama about these atrocious choices for economic advisers and officials he continually makes, I would prefer people focus on the problem of the pecuniary culture of our country, rather than being distracted in a useless debate over whether or not Obama is a corporate shill or a Reaganite in disguise, or whatever. Look at it this way: what really are the political chances that someone like Bill Black or Michael Hudson will be nominated and approved for high level economic policy positions? Or, another way, why do the greediest and most selfish people, with no conception at all of the general welfare, so completely dominate economic policy making in the USA? \xa0Why, in a word, does the political culture spawned by the neo-liberal idea that market forces should dictate the destinies of nations rather than the people acting through the agency of their government, leave us with such horrible, pernicious elites? We may comfort ourselves by thinking our elites are merely incompetent, or even greedy and corrupt, but I have reached the conclusion that such analyses is dangerous as it does not strike at the criminal essence of our elites.\n<p>The older I get, the more bruises I suffer toiling to accumulate wisdom, the more I come to appreciate what an excellent book the Bible is. Penny Pritzker, oppressor of labor, smasher of unions, exploiter of the poor, consort of criminals. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” the Bible counsels.

292	Wanting	China's central bank	company	https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/14/WS5f5f5cd0a3101ccd0bee04a3.html	"China's central bank is steadily promoting research and development pilot work for the digitalized currency, or the ""digital RMB"". Some key characteristics were further explained by a senior official on Monday.

The ""digital RMB"" is China's legal tender issued by the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Only designated institutions can participate in the digital RMB's operational system and exchange the currency with the public, relying on an ""account-based system"", the central bank's vice governor Fan Yifei said in an article for Financial News, an official newspaper of the central bank.

As the digital RMB is a replacement of cash in circulation, or the M0, instituions and individuals should accept any private or public debt repayment by the digital RMB. ""It is not allowed to reject the digital currency payment,"" the central bank official wrote.

The new type of currency should also follow the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, as well as regulations for the management methods of large amount of cash, according to the article.

The value of the digital currency is equivalent to banknotes and coins, which has the feature of ""controllable anonymity"", according to Fan, who added the issuance and management system of the digital RMB is centralized, with PBOC at the core.

The PBOC is responsible for the ""wholesaling"" of digital RMB to designated commercial banks, and in charge of the whole ""life-cycle"" management of the system. Commercial banks and other institutions are responsible for providing digital RMB exchange and circulation services to the public.

The central bank will control the issuance quota of the digital RMB, working out unified technical, security and application standards. In addition, it will manage digital RMB wallets, which allow users to deposit money into an account stored on their electronic devices.

""The digital RMB is a public product provided by the central bank. It does not pay interest, nor does the central bank charge for services such as exchange and circulation,"" the article said."

295	Sebastien	Gerhard Schroeder	individual	https://qz.com/1232384/putins-relationship-with-germanys-ex-leader-has-created-a-new-word-for-corruption/	"As Vladimir Putin returns to office for a fourth term, criticism is bubbling back up over former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s close relationship with the Russian president.

A spokesman for current chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday (March 19) had to reject the suggestion that the EU sanction Schroeder for supporting Putin while the German was chancellor, and then taking well-paid jobs by the Russian state after leaving office. Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin had backed a call for sanctions made in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall) during the weekend.

“It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin’s projects abroad,” Klimkin told the German newspaper Bild. “Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin worldwide. So it should be examined how the EU can act here.”

The two men’s relationship is so notorious that it has spawned a word used by political analysts and human rights activists in three languages: “Schroederization” in English, “Schröderisierung” in German, and “Schroederizatsia” (“Шрёдеризация”) in Russian. In English and Russian, “it means ‘the corruption of a political elite in another country,'” said Boris Reitschuster, a German former Moscow correspondent and author of Putin’s Hidden War, at PutinCon, a gathering of the world’s biggest Kremlin critics on March 16.

In German, the word seems to have extra nuances. While some use it to refer to corruption, one politician from Merkel’s Christian Democrats recently employed it to describe a closeness to the Kremlin. He appealed (link in German) to Schroeder’s old Social Democratic Party to not develop uncomfortably close ties to Moscow or help Kremlin propaganda, which he characterized a potential “Schroederization.”

The phrase has been attributed to Edward Lucas, a hawkish former Moscow correspondent for The Economist, but Lucas says former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves coined the word.

Schroeder and Putin go way back, first becoming close as two alpha-male European leaders in the early 2000s. Just before the German was ejected from office after losing his 2005 re-election campaign to Merkel, he gave Putin a parting gift: approval of the Kremlin’s controversial Nord Stream pipeline. The project directed Russian gas into Europe via Germany, upping Moscow’s leverage over the continent. (Russia had previously relied on a route through Ukraine, which was a source of various disputes between the two countries, often leading to Moscow temporarily shutting off the pipeline.) Straight after his election defeat, Schroeder took a well-remunerated job as chairman of the project. After its completion, he became chair of its second iteration, Nord Stream 2, and last year was named chairman of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Bad bromance?

The two men share more than just a passion for Russian oil and gas expansion, though. They’ve long enjoyed having a good hug.

Like that time in April 2001.

And September 2001.

And November 2001.

And December 2001.

The AP and Reuters have no documented hugs in 2002. But the news organizations caught Schroeder and Putin finding each other again in October 2003.

And their wives awkwardly watching the two connect again in April 2004.

The two men found a furtive corner in July 2005.

By October 2005, they’d got that walking side-hug down.

After Schroeder left office in November 2005, the press wasn’t around as much to document any potential embraces. But in 2014, just after Putin’s annexation of Crimea, the European Press Association snapped him giving Schroeder a cuddle in St Petersburg on the German’s 70th birthday. The German media wasn’t impressed."

Earlier in the day,\xa0Ukraine’s foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin had <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-calls-for-sanctions-against-gerhard-schroder/"">backed a call</a> for sanctions made in a Wall Street Journal <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/putins-key-oligarch-escapes-sanctions-1521239535"">op-ed</a>\xa0(paywall) during the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>“It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin’s projects abroad,” Klimkin told the German newspaper Bild. “Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin worldwide. So it should be examined how the EU can act here.”</p>\n\n<p>The two men’s relationship is so notorious that it has spawned a word used by political analysts and human rights activists in three languages: “Schroederization” in English, “Schröderisierung” in German, and “Schroederizatsia” (“Шрёдеризация”) in Russian. In English and Russian, “it means ‘the corruption of a political elite in another country,\'” <a href=""https://twitter.com/MddeH/status/974721820493537280"">said</a> Boris Reitschuster, a German former Moscow correspondent and author of\xa0<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073QZF8WW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=washpost-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B073QZF8WW""><em>Putin’s Hidden War</em></a>, at PutinCon, a gathering of the world’s biggest Kremlin critics on March 16.</p>\n\n<p>In German, the word seems to have extra nuances. While some use it to refer to corruption, one politician from Merkel’s Christian Democrats recently employed it to describe a closeness to the Kremlin. He\xa0<a href=""http://www.maz-online.de/Nachrichten/Politik/CDU-SPD-droht-Schroederisierung"">appealed</a>\xa0(link in German) to Schroeder’s old Social Democratic Party to not develop uncomfortably close ties to Moscow or help Kremlin propaganda, which he characterized a potential “Schroederization.”</p>\n\n<p>The phrase has <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ge4XDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT83&amp;lpg=PT83&amp;dq=Edward+Lucas+termed+the+schroederization+of+the+European+political+classes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ChkzFOBngS&amp;sig=TKI_-WySQSxV92L1F2UxAGC1G6M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDq_LCyPjZAhWErFkKHUEUAUEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Lucas%20termed%20the%20schroederization%20of%20the%20European%20political%20classes&amp;f=false"">been attributed</a> to Edward Lucas, a hawkish former Moscow correspondent for The Economist, but Lucas\xa0<a href=""https://twitter.com/edwardlucas/status/841748157818101760?s=19"">says</a> former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves coined the word.</p>\n\n<p>Schroeder and Putin go way back, first becoming close as two alpha-male European leaders in the early 2000s. Just before the German was ejected from office after losing his 2005 re-election campaign to Merkel, he gave Putin a parting gift: approval of the Kremlin’s controversial Nord Stream pipeline. The project directed Russian gas into Europe via Germany, upping Moscow’s leverage over the continent. (Russia had previously relied on a route through Ukraine, which was a source of <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29521564"">various</a> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/world/europe/russia-cuts-off-gas-to-ukraine-in-cost-dispute.html"">disputes</a> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/07/gas-ukraine"">between</a> the two countries, often leading to Moscow temporarily shutting off the pipeline.) Straight after his election defeat, Schroeder took a well-remunerated job as chairman of the project. After its completion, he became chair of its second iteration, Nord Stream 2, and last year was named chairman of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft.</p>\n\n<h2>Bad bromance?</h2>\n\n<p>The two men share more than just a passion for Russian oil and gas expansion, though. They’ve long enjoyed having a good hug.</p>\n\n<p>Like that time in April 2001.</p>\n\n<p>And September 2001.</p>\n\n<p>And November 2001.</p>\n\n<p>And December 2001.</p>\n\n<p>The AP and Reuters have no documented hugs in 2002.

116	Shakshi	Indian Govt	Organization	https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-loses-rs-13000-crore-every-year-due-to-illegal-cigarettes-report-911228.html	"India loses a revenue of about Rs 13,000 crore every year due to illegal cigarettes trade.

India now accounts for as much as one-fourth of the world's illegal cigarette market, according to a report by tobacco industry body The Tobacco Institute of India (TII). Illegal cigarettes have more than doubled from 12.5 billion sticks in 2005 to 26.5 billion sticks in 2018, the report noted quoting Euromonitor International data.

One of the key reasons behind the rise in illegal cigarettes trading, which hit a record high during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, is extremely high tax. “Extremely high and constantly increasing tax rates on cigarettes provide a profitable opportunity for tax evasion thereby encouraging growth in illegal trade,” the report noted.

The report points out that the legal cigarette industry in India is suffering due to high taxation on cigarettes over the years particularly between 2012-13 and 2017-18.

""The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime introduced in July 2017, increased the tax burden on cigarettes by increasing the GST compensation cess rates by a weighted average of about 13 per cent over the pre-GST tax rates,” the report found.

It further added, ""The huge increase in National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 is likely to provide a further boost to the illicit tax evaded cigarette trade in the country.""

India is the world’s second-largest producer and a major exporter of tobacco, which provides livelihood to 45.7 million people. The industry body pointed out that tobacco products generate tax revenue to the tune of Rs 43,000 crore annually.

Yes, illegal cigarettes are cheap but what at what cost?

43	Canberk	WareIQ	Company	https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/wareiq-raises-1-65m-for-its-amazon-like-delivery-platform-for-sellers-india/	"Despite e-commerce firms Amazon and Walmart and others pouring billions of dollars into India, offline retail still commands more than 95% of all sales in the world’s second largest internet market.

The giants have acknowledged the strong hold neighborhood stores (mom and pop shops) have in the country, and in recent quarters scrambled for ways to work with them. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, has made the dynamics more interesting in the past year as he works to help these neighborhood stores sell online.

But the market opportunity is still too large, and there are many aspects of the old retail business that could use some tech. That’s the bet WareIQ, a Bangalore-headquartered, Y Combinator-backed startup is making. And it has just raised a $1.65 million seed financing round from YC, FundersClub, Pioneer Fund, Soma Capital, Emles Venture Advisors and founders of Flexport.

The one-year-old startup operates a platform to leverage the warehouses across the country. It has built a management system for these warehouses, most of which largely engage in offline business-to-business commerce and have had little to no prior e-commerce exposure.

“We connect these warehouses across India to our platform and utilize their infrastructure for e-commerce order processing,” said Harsh Vaidya, co-founder and chief executive of WareIQ, in an interview with TechCrunch. The company offers this as a service to retail businesses.

Who are these businesses? Third-party sellers (some of whom sell to Amazon and Flipkart and use WareIQ to speed up their delivery), e-commerce firms, social commerce platforms, as well as neighborhood stores and social media influencers.

Any online store, for instance, can send its products to WareIQ, which has integrations with several popular e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. It works with courier partners to move items from one warehouse to another to offer the fastest delivery, explained Vaidya.

The infrastructure stitched together by WareIQ also enables an online seller to set up their own store and engage with customers directly, thereby saving fees they would have paid to Amazon and other established e-commerce players.

“The sellers were not able do this on their own before because it required them to talk directly to warehousing companies that maintain their own rigid contracts, and high-security deposits, and they still needed to work with multiple technology providers to complete the tech-stack,” he said. WareIQ also offers these sellers last-mile delivery, cash collection and fraud detection among several other services.

“In a way, we are building an open-source Amazon fulfilment service, where any seller can send their goods to any of our warehouses and we fulfil their Amazon orders, Myntra orders, Flipkart orders or their own website orders. We also comply with the standard of these individual marketplaces, so our sellers get a Prime tag on Amazon,” he said.

WareIQ is free for anyone to sign up with any charge and it takes a cut by the volume of orders it processes. The startup today works with more than 40 fulfilment centres and plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its network to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, he said. It’s also hiring for a number of tech roles."

A seaport never sleeps. Cargo shipping is vital for keeping supply chains moving and the country fed and well-supplied during the current pandemic. Port employees have continued working throughout the pandemic. They’ve not shut down like so many industries have.

Another industry that has never shut down is human trafficking. In fact, as much of the world has turned its attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, the crime of human trafficking has been able to flourish.

Although it is quietly hidden, human trafficking thrives during times of chaos and vulnerability. The maritime community can benefit from an improved understanding of human trafficking and learning how employees at seaports can play a key role in helping vulnerable people.

Victims of human trafficking include children, women and men who are subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labor through the use of force, fraud or coercion. At seaports in particular, traffickers can take advantage of discrepancies in maritime law in order to exploit their victims, making a tremendous profit.

It is easier for traffickers to operate at sea. Especially in the COVID-19 era, crewmembers can be forced to work long hours, manipulated into extending their contracts, be paid less than they agreed to work for, or see their wages withheld entirely.

It is not just labor trafficking that seaports need to watch for. Sex trafficking can happen at ports as well. Survivors of human trafficking report that sailors can be sex buyers. In these instances, the sex buying can happen at port facilities or onboard docked ships. The U.S. Department of Justice Human Trafficking Task Force reports that 83 percent of U.S. sex trafficking victims are U.S. citizens, and that the average age a victim is first exploited for commercial sex is between 12-14 years old.

Preventing labor and sex trafficking is becoming more of a priority for the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This year, the DOT launched a new national pledge program against human trafficking, where they’ve asked transportation leaders to commit to helping end the practice. Signing the pledge includes committing to train employees to recognize and report the signs of human trafficking.

So far, more than 200 groups—including airports, transportation authorities, and seaports, have joined the DOT’s pledge. And in January 2020, DHS released a new report outlining their commitment to ending human trafficking. This report summarized their priorities for the next five years, including plans for prevention, protection, prosecution and partnership—which includes key security checkpoints.

Seaports are a critical checkpoint for stopping human trafficking. Employees working at ports can be turned into advocates for human trafficking victims when they are properly trained to know how to spot a potential trafficking situation. As more ports increasingly recognize their interdependence with the local community, it will serve ports well to recognize that they have a valuable asset in the fight against human trafficking—their workers. When port employees receive human trafficking awareness training, they can learn how to spot a potential trafficking situation happening at maritime facilities and know how to report it quickly and safely. This can allow more exploited people the chance to escape their traffickers and rebuild their lives.

The nonprofit organization Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking (BEST) has created a 30-minute, video-simulated training specifically for port employees. This new training is labeled Ports to Freedom, and it can help front line employees and managers learn the indicators of human trafficking and how they can report it to the proper authorities. When ports begin providing training, it can help save lives by generating more eyes and ears looking out for the warning signs of human trafficking at seaports.

Arrest: Mariano Abete is the son of Mafia super-boss Archangel Abete
A baby-faced mafia don thought to be one of Italy's youngest-ever gang bosses has been captured by police in Italy.
Mariano Abete, 21, who is nicknamed 'baby-boss' in the Italian media, was arrested hiding in a secret room concealed behind a remote-controlled wall at his mother's house.
He had been leading the family in a turf war between rival factions of the Neapolitan Camorra which has already claimed dozens of lives.  
Abete had taken the helm after his father was arrested and his uncle murdered, and was wanted by police for mafia association and conspiracy to sell drugs. 
Despite his age, he was said to be powerful and dangerous.
Police swooped on the the house in Naples in the early hours of Saturday before closing in on his hiding place.
But as they began to break through the wall his terrified mother, herself aged only 39, is said to have intervened, begging: 'Please don't hurt him, I'll open it.'
Video of his hiding place, a minute cell hidden between two walls accessible only by a moveable wall operated by remote control, was last night circulating on the web. 
The narrow cavity contained only a mattress, a pillow, a crucifix and a cannister of oxygen.
￼
Abete is considered mafia royalty, being the son of the super-boss Archangel Abete, so-called because he led a splinter group rebellion against the ruling family.
He is also the nephew of another notorious mafia don killed in an ambush in September in a suspected revenge attack for the murder of a notorious mafioso known as  'Wooden Hands'. 
The nickname derived from the fact that he wore prosthetics after losing his hands a decade ago when a home-made bomb exploded.
The hit was the latest murder in the vicious gang war being waged for control of drug trafficking in the Naples districts of Scampia and Secondigliano."

42	Canberk	Michael Milken	Person	https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/michaelmilken.asp	"Who Is Michael Milken?

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute. Milken was an executive at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s and used high-yield junk bonds for corporate financing and mergers and acquisitions. Milken amassed an enormous personal fortune and was indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury and eventually spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud. While he is credited with founding the high-yield debt market, he was banned for life from the securities industry.

Key Takeaways

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute.
He joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969 and started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s.
Milken was indicted and spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud.
Milken was banned for life from the securities industry.

Understanding Michael Milken

Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. It was during his time with the firm that he started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s. These bonds provide much-needed capital for companies that don't necessarily have ready access to credit. During his time at the firm, he was able to raise a huge amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. This allowed him to eventually expand his high-yield bond department. At the height of his success, Milken earned between $200 million and $550 million a year.

On April 24, 1990, Milken plead guilty to five technical counts of violating securities laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, but was released after two years for good behavior. He was also fined $600 million. Since his release, Milken has been remaking his image and is attempting to secure a pardon for the charges he plead guilty to in 1990.

Following his release from prison, he worked as a strategic consultant. This was in violation of his probation, and he was subsequently fined $42 million for these actions. In 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since then, he has devoted much of his time and resources to the pursuit of a cure for the disease.

After being released from prison, Milken was fined for working as a consultant—a violation of his probation.

According to Forbes, Milken's net worth is estimated at $3.7 billion as of September 2019. He co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation as well as the Milken Institute, an economic think tank that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.

Special Considerations

Early in his career, Milken saw an opportunity to leverage junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. He saw a way for investors to see high returns—on a risk-adjusted basis—by buying bonds that were issued by companies with low credit ratings compared with acquiring bonds from AAA-rated companies. At the time, the availability of such bonds was limited and Milken anticipated demand would quickly outpace supply for this investment opportunity. The firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham Lambert, launched an effort to underwrite more junk bonds by convincing such companies to issue them.

The companies in question may have been early-stage or otherwise not well-established. Their low credit rating may not necessarily have been a result of poor financial health, but rather from a lack of an extensive track record to base their credit ratings on. Such circumstances are typically seen with new and emerging industries. From the companies’ perspective, issuing bonds was a way to potentially access more capital that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue. Milken’s efforts at Drexel Burnham are credited with launching this market.

As the junk bond market grew, Milken sought to maintain a dominant position over this sector, and some of his efforts led to engaging in business activities that eventually led to his arrest and conviction for securities fraud."

32	Shakshi	Devis Leonel RIVERA MARADIAGA	Individual	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-honduras-drugs-idUSKBN1WX24K	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduran politician Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernandez was found guilty of U.S. drug trafficking charges on Friday after a two-week trial that featured dramatic accusations of corruption against his brother, the Central American nation’s president.

The verdict against Hernandez, 41, on all counts was handed up by a jury in federal court in Manhattan. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17 and faces up to life in prison.

“They reached a verdict that was inconsistent with the truth,” one of Hernandez’s lawyers, Omar Malone, told journalists outside the courthouse. “We plan to appeal on behalf of Mr. Hernandez.”

Members of Hernandez’s family who attended the trial were swarmed by protesters as they left the courthouse. Some protesters chanted “Fuera JOH,” meaning “Out with JOH,” referring to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in 2018 and charged with drug trafficking and possessing illegal weapons. U.S. prosecutors accused him of helping smuggle almost 200,000 kilograms (220 tons) of cocaine into the United States while enjoying the protection of his brother. President Hernandez has repeatedly denied the allegation.

In a Twitter post, he said that he received news of the verdict with “great sadness.” The verdict was “based on testimonies of confessed murderers,” referring to former drug traffickers who cooperated with U.S. authorities in the trial.

The two-week trial featured testimony from Honduran drug traffickers who are now in U.S. custody and cooperating with authorities, including, Amilcar Alexander Ardon, a former mayor, and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Honduras’ Cachiros gang.

Some of the most explosive testimony was from Ardon, who told jurors that Tony Hernandez promised Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1 million donation to his brother’s presidential campaign in 2013.

Rivera Maradiaga, who admitted to murdering 78 people, testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandez’s lawyers urged jurors not to trust the prosecutors’ cooperating witnesses, describing them as career criminals willing to lie to get their prison sentences reduced.

The president, who began his second term in January 2018 amid allegations of electoral fraud, has not been charged with a crime. He has represented himself as tough on narcotics and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing 24 traffickers to the United States. He said traffickers were using his brother’s trial to seek revenge.

308	Wanting	General	Authority	https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/police-report-uptick-in-scams-financial-fraud-cyberfraud-criminal-cybercrimnals/	"The Hawaii Police Department said Friday that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has experienced an increase in reporting of financial crimes by individuals and businesses.

Those include identity thefts, theft offenses related to credit cards, computer-related crimes, forgery and financial exploitation.

“We’ve certainly had an uptick in fraud-type incidents,” said Lt. Rio Amon-Wilkins of the department’s Criminal Investigations Section in Hilo.

For example, he said there has been increase in scam calls to people’s cellphones.

“And then there’s been a fair amount of mail thefts … people reporting that credit cards and loan applications were applied for and granted in their name,” he said. “There’s also been a handful of cyber crime issues involving apps. Somehow, these mobile apps are being linked to people’s bank accounts, and (criminals) are able to withdraw money from there. They’re able to withdraw great sums of money from their checking and savings accounts, and tracing that is extremely difficult.”

“Particularly during crisis situations, there is always an uptick in bad actors who take advantage of honest people,” said Krishna Jayaram, a special assistant to the state attorney general. “During this pandemic, we urge our communities to exercise extra caution and follow the recommendations of the Hawaii Island police.”

Police say many of the offenses are sophisticated crimes perpetuated by cyber criminals through “phishing” and “spoofing” — which are fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords and financial information by electronic communication.

Forms of communications include emails, phone calls and websites that originate from an unknown source but appear as being from a known or trusted source. The goal is to gain access a victim’s personal financial information, or spreading malware through infected links or attachments.

With the heavy reliance of computers, mobile devices and networks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber criminals are exploiting the vulnerability of individuals and businesses through data breaches of financial accounts. They also are targeting online shoppers, as well as focusing on stealing stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and paycheck protection program payments.

“Social distancing and lockdowns are not slowing the business of fraud,” said Keali‘i Lopez, AARP Hawaii state director. “The pandemic — and having more people staying home and working from home — has given scammers more opportunities to come up with new ways to take your money.

“We’re seeing it at AARP Hawaii in the kinds of emails and text messages we’re getting. For example, one of our staff recently got text messages that appear to be a package scam, something the Federal Trade Commission recently warned us about. Don’t click on the links in emails or text messages. Even messages from friends or government agencies can be spoofed and may not really be from them.”

Package scams are a phishing scam where the victim receives an email saying they have a package waiting for them and contains a link. That link leads to questions that ask for financial and personal information that shouldn’t be given to unknown parties, and also allows the scammers to download malware on the victim’s device that could steal passwords and financial information.

While not totally eliminating the possibility of becoming a victim, police recommend taking the following precautions.

Conduct regular checks of your banking statements for accuracy and report any irregularities to your financial institution.

If your occupation requires you to work from home, you should consider a separate router to separate your home and work network traffic and using the strongest security configuration for online protection.

When examining an email to determine its legitimacy, look for unusual phrases, grammatical or spelling errors, or transposing of letters in the URL, also referred to as the “web address,” because these are often indicators of spoofing or phishing attempts.

Don’t click on unfamiliar links or download attachments you may receive in any emails. Instead, delete them.

If using mobile or computer applications to perform banking online, set up strong passwords and change them regularly.

You should also set up “two-factor authentication” which involves logging into your account with your user name and password and requiring a time-sensitive code sent to the device which needs to be entered by the user for verification.

If you receive a mobile or land-line call from an unknown or unfamiliar number, do not answer it. Instead, let the call go to your voice mail. These “robocalls” often use applications to display an area code from your area along with a random or unused phone number. If you happen to answer the call or hear a recording, do not provide any personal or financial information. Simply hang up.

To prevent further robocalls, consider looking for a “call-blocking solution” or download the “donotcall” app from the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

Finally, if you become a victim of a financial crime, prepare a packet that includes your financial statements as well as documents supporting the crime, such as emails, invoices, receipts, and others, to turn over to police when reporting the incident. It is recommended that you also retain a copy of all of your documents for file.

“Stay vigilant. Log into your accounts regularly,” said Amon-Wilkins. “If you see any suspicious activity at all, contact the police and contact the financial institution. And I always recommend not putting anything with a check or anything with confidential personal information in your mailbox at home. You should take it to the post office.

“… It think it’s also a great recommendation for people to get mailboxes that lock, so when you do put mail in there, it’s a lot more difficult for people to steal it from the box.”

In addition, the AARP Fraud Watch Network offers resources and help for victims of fraud. It’s available at aarp.org/fraud or by calling 1-877-908-3360.

“Whether they are phishing with emails from your utility company or calling pretending to be contact tracers, the bottom line is they are trying to get your data and your money,” Lopez said.

122	Canberk	Anisul Huq	Person	https://www.thedailystar.net/country/news/bangladesh-committed-curb-corruption-minister-1749664	"Law Minister Anisul Huq today said Bangladesh is firmly committed to fight against corruption and thus graft is being curbed in the country day by day.

He came up with the observation while addressing the 10th session of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) Implementation Review Group (IRG) in Vienna, capital of Austria, law ministry sources said.

“We also expect that the international community would extend their full support to us, in order to materialize corruption free society which was a dream of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is the liberator of Bangladesh, and the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in 1971 for establishing a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh,” Minister Huq said.

He said, “Article 20 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh provides that as a general principle, no person shall be able to enjoy unearned incomes meaning that the Constitution being the supreme law of Bangladesh prohibits corruption”.

Minister Anisul is leading the Bangladesh delegation, including senior officials from Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division of Ministry of Law, Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh mission in Vienna at the thee-day conference.

He said, “I would like to mention here that the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947; the Criminal Law amendment Act, 1958; the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 (with latest amendment in 2013); the Right to Information Act, 2009; the Whistle Blower Protection Act, 2011; the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012; the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, 2012; the Extradition Act, 1974; the Public Procurement Act, 2006 and the Rules made thereunder; the Anti-terrorism Act, 2009; the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2009 etc. are major legal instruments in Bangladesh towards implementation of UNCAC provisions”.

“Apart from this, Bangladesh has established the National Human Rights Commission and the Information Commission. Bangladesh has also adopted the National Integrity Strategy (NIS) by the Cabinet Division to build up a golden prosperous corruption free society,” Anisul said.

“Corruption Prevention Committees have been formed by the Anti-Corruption Commission in 9 Metropolitan Cities, 62 Districts and 421 Upazillas (local Govt. unit) with a view to creating integrity and honesty among members of the society by massive awareness programs. ‘Honesty & Integrity Units’ have been set up in Schools, Colleges and other educational institutions all over the country”, the law minister added."

The authorities fined Ms. Fan, 37, the equivalent of nearly $70 million in unpaid taxes and penalties after an investigation found that she and employees of her production company had underreported her earnings from her blockbuster films — a practice that is said to be common in China, and not only in the entertainment industry.

In her first public statement since dropping from public view four months ago, Ms. Fan offered a contrite apology and pledged to pay the fine to avoid a criminal investigation.

322	Kristjan	Kaloti	Company	https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54238918	"A gold refiner that was used by criminals to launder drug money has been allowed to sell gold into global supply chains used to make smartphones and cars.

International investigators concluded that the Dubai-based trader Kaloti was buying gold from criminal networks.

The US Treasury was urged by law enforcement six years ago to warn the world that it was a ""primary money laundering concern"".

But the warning was never given.

As a result, Kaloti has continued to sell tonnes of gold to companies in the supply chains of Apple, General Motors and Amazon, which use the precious metal in components. This has put firms and millions of consumers at risk of unwittingly funding criminal activity.

The US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

Kaloti's representatives said it ""vehemently denied"" it was knowingly involved in any crime or misconduct.

'Honey Badger'

Confidential documents seen by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the BBC reveal the US Treasury was urged by investigators in 2014 to issue the warning after a three-year investigation.

Codenamed ""Honey Badger"" and led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the investigation concluded that Kaloti was involved in a scheme to transport or transfer ""tremendous amounts of illicit value through the use of gold as a commodity"".

Under the scheme described in the documents, criminals anywhere in the world could use drug money or other unlawfully obtained cash to buy scrap gold such as second-hand jewellery and bring it to Kaloti.

In exchange for the gold, according to investigators, Kaloti would offer bulk cash or send a wire transfer to them.

In 2014, the DEA recommended that the US Treasury should publicly designate Kaloti a ""primary money laundering concern"" under the US Patriot Act, which would have made it too risky for global banks to do business with them, freezing the group out of the global financial system.

But the US Treasury never took action against Kaloti. Former officials said it put off a decision on the recommendation, concerned about the reaction of the United Arab Emirates, a key diplomatic ally, where Kaloti was based.

When the UAE failed to act on its own initiative, the investigation was shelved.

Suspicious activity

Kaloti did not have the chance to see or challenge any of the evidence as they were not questioned by investigators and there could be undisclosed reasons justifying why the report wasn't acted upon. Attempts to obtain an explanation from the US Treasury failed to draw a response.

The investigation, which the US government has never made public, was supported by a flood of reports of suspicious activity from banks across the world handling Kaloti's money.

Lenders including Deutsche Bank and Barclays submitted 34 separate reports about Kaloti to the US Treasury's Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), highlighting as suspicious thousands of transactions from 2007 to 2015 totalling $9.3bn (£7.26bn).

In 2017 a money laundering gang was convicted in France of laundering the proceeds of drug sales all over Europe including the UK.

Last October, BBC Panorama revealed that a company controlled by the gang, Renade International, had sold $146m (£114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone - part of $5.2bn of gold purchases paid for with cash.

Kaloti vehemently denies ever acting improperly and says it has never been accused or contacted by any US authority about wrongdoing.

It says it performs full due diligence on all customers and suppliers.

Lawyers for the firm said it had successfully passed audits each year against all regulatory and legal standards.

Supply chain fears

The DEA-led taskforce investigating Kaloti submitted a report of their investigation and recommended the primary money laundering designation in August 2014.

But after the designation didn't materialise, gold sold by Kaloti has continued to end up in major supply chains.

Apple's list of approved suppliers includes entities which have purchased tonnes of gold from Kaloti, including Valcambi, one of the largest gold refiners in the world, based in Switzerland.

All modern smartphones feature components made with gold, which is a highly conductive metal.

This year the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness reported that in 2018 and 2019, Valcambi purchased up to 20 tonnes of gold directly from Kaloti and a further 60 tonnes from a related entity.

A further report by the Tech Transparency Project listed two further Swiss refiners which had purchased gold from Kaloti and were also on Apple's list of suppliers.

Valcambi said it would not confirm or deny buying gold from Kaloti. The company said it only purchases gold from its suppliers ""where the company can fully ensure the identification of the origin of the gold"".

In a statement, Apple said it was committed to responsibly sourcing for its products: ""If a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. Since 2015, we've stopped working with 63 refiners of gold for this reason.

""Several thorough and independent reviews have been conducted since 2015, and there is no evidence that any gold from Kaloti enters Apple products.""

Kaloti is listed as being in the supply chain for General Motors and Amazon, according to data submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator.

General Motors, which uses gold in car parts such as catalytic converters, said it was committed to responsible sourcing of goods used in its manufacturing and had not done business with Kaloti directly.

It said none of its suppliers had shared any compliance issues or concerns regarding Kaloti.

Amazon said it was ""committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights and the environment. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles.

""We expect suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products.""

Investigators who had worked for years to expose money laundering linked to Kaloti describe themselves as ""incredibly frustrated"" by the US Treasury's handling of the matter.

""We put a tremendous amount of work and effort over three years into the case - we all lived and breathed it,"" said one of the people on the DEA-led taskforce, speaking anonymously."

86	Dan	Robert T. Brockman	Person	https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/10/16/texas-billionaire-robert-brockman-charged-2-billion-tax-fraud-scheme/	"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Federal prosecutors charged Texas billionaire Robert Brockman on Thursday with a $2 billion tax fraud scheme in what they say is the largest such case against an American.

Department of Justice officials said at a news conference that Brockman, 79, hid capital gains income over 20 years through a web of offshore entities in Bermuda and Nevis and secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. Prosecutors announced that the CEO of a private equity firm that aided in the schemes would cooperate with the investigation.

The 39-count indictment unsealed Thursday charges Brockman, the chief executive officer of Ohio-based software company Reynolds and Reynolds Co., with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses.

Prosecutors also announced that Robert F. Smith, founder and chairman of Vista Equity Partners, will cooperate in the investigation and pay $139 million to settle his own tax probe. Smith, 57, stunned a senior class last year when he promised to wipe out the student loan debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse, a historically Black all-male college.

“Complexity will not hide crime from law enforcement. Sophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges,” said David L. Anderson, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California. “We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.”

Brockman appeared in federal court from Houston via Zoom Thursday. He entered a plea of not guilty to all counts and was released on $1 million bond, said Abraham Simmons, spokesman for the Northern District of California.

“Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,” said his attorney, Kathryn Keneally, in an email.

Prosecutors said Brockman used encrypted emails with code names, including Permit, Snapper, Redfish and Steelhead, to carry out the fraud and ordered evidence to be manipulated or destroyed.

Brockman, a resident of Houston and Pitkin County, Colorado, is chairman and CEO of Reynolds and Reynolds, a 4,300-employee company near Dayton, Ohio, that sells accounting, sales and management software to auto dealerships. The software helps set up websites, including live chats with potential customers, find loans and calculate customer payments, manage payroll and pay bills.

Reynolds & Reynolds issued a statement saying the allegations were outside Brockman’s work with the company and that the company is not alleged to have participated in any wrongdoing.

In 2013, a charitable trust set up by Brockman’s late father withdrew a pledged $250 million donation to Centre College, a small liberal arts school in Danville, Kentucky, where Brockman attended class and once served as chairman of the board of trustees.

At the time the school said it was due to a “significant capital market event” that didn’t pan out. A spokesman for Reynolds and Reynolds said in 2013 that the event was a proposed refinancing deal involving Vista Equity Partners, Smith’s company.

According to the indictment, Brockman gave an unnamed individual detailed instructions regarding the proposed gift to the college, including talking points, and directed the person to threaten to pull out if his demands were not met. In August, he instructed the person to cancel the gift.

Prosecutors say that Smith used about $2.5 million in untaxed funds to buy and upgrade a vacation home in Sonoma, California; purchase two ski properties in France; and spend $13 million to buy a property and fund charitable activities at his property in Colorado.

Anderson applauded Smith for stepping up, despite the serious nature of his crimes, which occurred from 2000 to mid-2015.

“Smith’s agreement to cooperate has put him on a path away from indictment,” he said.

In 2019, Smith announced to the graduating class at Morehouse College that he would pay off the student loan debt of the entire class, saying that he expected the graduates to “pay it forward.” The estimated cost was $40 million.

Forbes lists Smith as #461 on its billionaires list, with a net worth of more than $5 billion.

He founded the tech investment firm Vista in 2000 and Forbes reports that it now has over $50 billion in assets and is “one of the best-performing private equity firms, posting annualized returns of 22% since inception.” Vista has offices in San Francisco and Oakland.

Vista did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee was swimming in cash, and by the time the festivities had ended, it had raised over $107 million—far more than any other presidential inaugural in history. But it also spent extravagantly, and according to documents recently revealed as part of a lawsuit, staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with them—much of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

The records made public as part of the lawsuit reveal that there was a real lack of separation between the Trumps as business owners and the Trumps as the incoming first family. Shortly after the 2016 election, as the newly formed committee was scrambling to organize inaugural events, Rick Gates, the committee’s deputy chair, received a quote from the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the cost of using the hotel’s ballroom. The price tag for the luxury DC establishment, housed in the historic Old Post Office building and owned and operated by the family of the president-elect was huge: $3.6 million for eight days of use, or $450,000 per day. Gates emailed Ivanka Trump, who owns a piece of the hotel, to raise his concerns.

Staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with them—much of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

“First, the cost itself seems quite high compared to other property buyouts for the week,” Gates wrote. “Second, I am a bit worried about the optics of PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee] paying Trump Hotel a high fee and the media making a big story out of it.”

A few days later, Ivanka Trump told Gates that she had called the general manager of the property and the hotel came back to the inaugural committee with a new quote—better, but still asking for $175,000 a day. That rate far exceeded the hotel’s own internal pricing guidelines, and it seems likely that Ivanka Trump, as a part-owner, knew that. (For comparison, the new court filing shows that another nonprofit paid just $5,000 to use part of the Trump Hotel ballroom for part of one of the days the Inaugural Committee had rented it, which matched the internal guidelines.)

At this point, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump who managed much of the inaugural planning, warned Ivanka Trump and Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here—audits on what locations were used and how much was paid to use them would be made public. “I understand that compared to the original pricing this is great but we should look at the whole context,” Winston Wolkoff wrote, adding that she thought $85,000 a day was the most she considered to be reasonable.

Winston Wolkoff’s concerns were ignored. The Presidential Inaugural Committee ended up paying the Trump Hotel $1 million for four days use of the hotel’s ballroom.

They probably should have heeded Winston Wolkoff’s warnings. The lawsuit bringing these records to light was filed by Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, DC, against the Inaugural Committee and the Trump Organization. Racine is arguing that the district has the right to seek the repayment of funds because nonprofits operating in Washington, DC, which the Inaugural Committee did, may not work to create profits for a private organization or individual. According to Racine, the Inaugural Committee “coordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel.” The attorney general is asking that the money be returned and given to charities that promote civic engagement. (Racine is also separately involved with one of the emoluments lawsuits against the president regarding the Trump Old Post Office hotel, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland.)

If the new lawsuit, which was filed this week, goes forward, it could release a further avalanche of details on how the most lavishly funded inaugural celebration frittered away tens of millions of dollars—and more details about how involved the Trump family itself was in the decision-making.

Unsurprisingly, representatives of the inaugural committee issued a statement to the Washington Post insisting that there was no misconduct.

Racine’s lawsuit also highlights how negotiations between the inaugural committee and the hotel happened specifically in the context of profits for the hotel. In early January 2017, when the committee was considering pulling out of at least one event at the hotel, the hotel’s manager emailed Gates highlighting his concerns: “Just heard that the Friday night reception had been canceled. Is it accurate? Tough on us if it is as it was a lot of revenue for 1,250 people,” Mickael Damelincourt wrote. Gates continued the negotiation.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump, warned Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here. Her concerns were ignored.

Racine’s supporting documents also offer a sense of the (sometimes comical) internal decisions being made for the most expensive inaugural celebration ever, which featured sparse crowds and far fewer events than normal. (Lists of tasks for inaugural committee staff are included in the suit because of the explicit references in them to the negotiations over use of the hotel space.) For instance, there are repeated mentions of Trump’s desire to arrive at a celebration on the mall in a military helicopter, flanked by members of the military. This idea was apparently nixed because at the time of the celebrations, Trump was not yet commander in chief. The documents also describe the president-elect’s hopes for military helicopters and tanks to flank the stage at the outdoor celebration. Another note describes how Donald and Ivanka Trump jointly decided that the Beach Boys would not be performing. At one point, a to-do list item includes asking Melania Trump about a family-and-friends tea reception at the White House, followed by a note from an inaugural committee staffer, “There should be NO reception.” Later, a more adamant note appeared: “Confirmed that NO tea will be hosted at WH and must be removed from schedule.”

Still, some of the most damning material revealed here has nothing to do with the Trump family and their over-the-top plans for the celebration. The documents repeatedly mention that inaugural committee staff should consult with Steve Wynn, the billionaire owner of Wynn Resorts who is a longtime GOP donor and personal friend of Donald Trump. The suggestions are highly specific—Wynn directing that the song “40 Hours a Week” by the band Alabama be played at an inaugural event. In 2018, Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct, which led him to step down as CEO of his casino company and as a finance chair for the Republican National Committee."

Zimbabwe's vice-president says she is taking legal action against state-owned media for linking her to an alleged plot to kill President Robert Mugabe.

Joyce Mujuru said she had ordered her lawyers to restore her ""political standing"" after being falsely accused of treason and corruption.

The Sunday Mail newspaper reported that a hit-man had planned to kill Mr Mugabe so that Mrs Mujuru could take power.

Last month, Mr Mugabe, 90, said he did not plan to step down.

He has governed Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.

'Demonic'

Mr Mugabe and Mrs Mujuru were once close comrades, but have now fallen out as a succession war rages in the ruling Zanu-PF party ahead of its elective congress next month, says the BBC's Brian Hungwe in the capital, Harare.

Mr Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe has recently led a sustained public campaign against Mrs Mujuru, calling on her to resign.

She has accused the vice-president of being ""demonic"" and divisive"", and extorting money from companies, the AFP news agency reports.

Mrs Mujuru's statement, denying she is plotting against Mr Mugabe, is unprecedented, our reporter says.

Although she does not give any indication that she plans to quit, she is under intense pressure and has few options, he adds.

The Sunday Mail made the sensational claim that top government officials linked to Mrs Mujuru sought to hire a hit-man to assassinate Mr Mugabe in order to open the way for her to become president, he adds.

""I deny any and all allegations of treason, corruption, incompetence and misuse of public office being routinely made against me in The Herald and The Sunday Mail newspapers,"" Mrs Mujuru said in a statement.

She had asked her lawyers to take the ""necessary steps at law to restore my good reputation, political standing and dignity"", she said.

'Spill Blood'

Mrs Mujuru and Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who in the past controlled the secret police and military, are seen as the leading contenders to succeed Mr Mugabe.

Mrs Mugabe's surprise entry into politics this year, and her nomination to lead Zanu-PF's women's wing, has also fuelled speculation that she could be planning to take over from her husband.

Last month, Mr Mugabe said he did not plan to step aside for young politicians who did not appreciate his role in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

Mrs Mujuru took part in the 1970s guerrilla war against white-minority rule, led by Mr Mugabe.

Her nom de guerre was Teurai Ropa (Spill Blood).

She married Solomon Mujuru, the former army chief seen as Zimbabwe's king-maker in 1977."

167	Shakshi	Aguila Saleh Issa	Individual	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguila_Saleh_Issa	"(Arabic: عقيلة صالح عيسى‎; born January 11, 1944 [1]) is a Libyan jurist and politician who is President of the Libyan House of Representatives since 5 August 2014. He is also a representative of the town of Al Qubbah, in the east of the country. [2] [3] [4]

Aguila Saleh Issa was born on January 11, 1944, in the town of Al Qubbah, Libya.

Following the 2014 Libyan Parliamentary election, Aguila Saleh Issa was elected as parliament speaker, but was forced to flee to Tobruk along with the rest of the Libyan House of Representatives after Tripoli was seized by militias. [5]

On February 20, 2015, Aguila Saleh Issa's residence was the target of bombing by ISIL militants in the town of Al Qubbah. In what became known as Al Qubbah bombings, bombs also targeted a petrol station and a police station. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Libya since the end of the 2011 civil war, resulting in a total of at least 40 people killed, although it was not clear how many died in the attack on his residence. ISIL said that the attacks were carried out in retaliation for the 2015 Egyptian military intervention in Libya.

174	Dan	Donald Trump	Induvidual	https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-business-bribe-companies-law-legal-change-a9289666.html	"Donald Trump ’s administration is considering making changes to a law that makes it illegal for American companies to bribe foreign officials in exchange for business.

In a press conference at the White House on Friday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters the administration was “looking at” the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

“I would just say: We are aware of it, we are looking at it, and we’ve heard complaints from some of our companies,” said Mr Kudlow in response to a question about the FCPA.

“I don’t want to say anything definitive policy-wise, but we are looking at it.”

Mr Kudlow would not go into specifics about the possible changes and told reporters to “wait until we get a better package”, according to CNBC.

According to Mr Rucker and Ms Leonnig, Mr Trump expressed his unhappiness at the FCPA, calling it “unfair”.

The FCPA was established in 1977 and states it is “unlawful for certain classes or persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business”.

Mr Trump in 2017 reportedly told former secretary of state Rex Tillerson: “It’s just so unfair that American companies aren’t allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas.

“We’re going to change that.”

Mr Trump reportedly told Mr Tillerson to “get rid of that law”, which Mr Tillerson said would be almost impossible to get Congress to do.

The president then reportedly instructed Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the FCPA.

89	Sebastien			https://allafrica.com/stories/202010160849.html	"Luanda — Angolan President, João Lourenço, renewed last Thursday, in Luanda, his commitment to the fight against corruption, stressing that this evil has already damaged the Angolan State by at least US $24 billion.

""We say at least because as the investigations around some ongoing processes and their likely protagonists are taking place, new things are being discovered"", said the statesman, during the message on the State of the Nation.

According to João Lourenço, it is likely that later, much larger numbers will be announced, which in itself already exceeds the value of Angola's debt to its main creditor.

Government data indicate that, in the context of the asset recovery process, the State has already recovered real estate and money worth more than USD 4.9 billion, of which more than USD 2.7 billion in cash.

The other part, estimated at more than USD 2.1 billion, results from the seizure of real estate, factories, port terminals, office buildings, housing buildings, radio and television stations, graphic units, commercial establishments and others.

The fight against corruption and impunity is one of the banners of President João Lourenço's governance.

However, it is part of the government's measures to ensure the creation of a more favourable environment for private investment.

This fight is being conducted by the judicial authorities, based on the Law on Coercive Repatriation and Extended Loss of Property, approved by Parliament, which has allowed the seizure of several assets built with public funds.

Currently, the State has been preparing the process of selling the assets to private entities.

The State of the Nation Speech was the highest point of the Solemn Session of the opening of the New Parliamentary Year, penultimate of the current legislature (2017-2022)."

307	Wanting	Afeez Olajide Adebara	individual	https://nationalcybersecuritynews.today/men-plead-guilty-in-okla-money-laundering-conspiracy-connected-to-nigerian-romance-scheme-onlinescams-scams-internetscams/	"TULSA, Okla. – A Norman man pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court for his role as a money launderer in a Nigerian romance scam that defrauded multiple victims, including elder Americans, of millions, announced U.S. Attorney Trent Shores.

Afeez Olajide Adebara, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering before U.S. District Court Judge Gregory K. Frizzell. Adebara’s sentencing hearing is set for Feb. 3, 2021.

“Adebara organized and led a money laundering operation from Oklahoma in order to conceal the proceeds of a Nigerian Romance Scam. He and his co-conspirators defrauded an Oklahoman and two other victims of more than $1.5 million,” said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. “Romance scams inflict the highest reported financial losses yearly, totaling about $200 million in 2019, when compared to other online scams. Con artists like Adebara have no shame. They care not if their victims are elders, veterans, or hard working Americans living paycheck to paycheck. I commend the FBI agents and federal prosecutors who took down this international money laundering operation.”

In his plea agreement, Adebara admitted that he knew the money involved in the financial transactions involved the proceeds from unlawful activity. He further stated that he knew the financial transactions were designed, in whole or in part, to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of the unlawful activity.

From 2017 through and November 2019, Adebara knowingly concealed the proceeds of a romance scam operation by moving money between and among multiple bank accounts that were opened under various aliases using fake passports and other fraudulent identification documents to obscure the source of the funds and the identities of the co-conspirators. Court documents state that he and his co-conspirators took further steps to conceal the source of the funds, took a commission, and directed the remainder of the funds back to the online romance scammers in Nigeria, including in the form of vehicles and vehicle parts.

According to court documents, Adebara coordinated with overseas co-conspirators who had assumed false identities on online dating websites and social media platforms with the intent to defraud victims. Adebara opened multiple accounts using fraudulent identities then provided the account and routing numbers to the overseas co-conspirators. The overseas co-conspirators told victims they were U.S. residents working abroad. In fact, the investigation revealed that these overseas co-conspirators were located in Nigeria. As these online “relationships” continued, the overseas co-conspirators’ would request increasingly larger sums of money, claiming that the funds were needed to complete business projects or to return to the United States. The victims were directed by the overseas co-conspirators to send funds to Adebara and others’ bank accounts, assuring the victims that he would allocate the money as needed.

Adebara was charged on Nov. 13, 2019, along with nine co-defendants. John Oluwaseun Ogundele, 31, formerly of Norman, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2020.

The remaining defendants are Joshua Naandom Ditep, 25, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Paul Usoro, 26, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Chibuzo Godwin Obiefuna, Jr., 27, U.S. citizen residing in Long Beach, California; Tobiloba Kehinde, 28, Nigerian citizen residing in Norman; Jamiu Ibukun Adedeji, 24, Nigerian citizen, residing in Norman; First and last name unknown #1, who maintained an address in Brooklyn, New York; First and last name unknown #2, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas; and First and last name unknown #3, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas. Ditep, Usoro, Obiefuna, Kehinde, and Adedeji await trial while the three additional co-defendants remain fugitives. These remaining defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The FBI’s Oklahoma City Field Office conducted the investigation. Trial Attorney Babasijibomi Moore of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Nassar of the Northern District of Oklahoma are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of an ongoing national effort by the Department of Justice to address online fraud schemes often based out of Nigeria that target U.S. citizens. The public is encouraged to report potential online fraud activity or scams to the FBI."

296	Dan	Philip Righter	Person	https://apnews.com/article/baea69f641674995d6b280e0a26585f6	"MIAMI (AP) — A California man was sentenced Wednesday to five years in federal prison for trying to sell forged art to a South Florida gallery.

A federal judge in Miami sentenced Philip Righter, 43, who pleaded guilty in March to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft, according to court records.

Righter’s scheme involved buying forgeries of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, investigators said. He made the forgeries appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity and elaborate backstories to establish their provenance and then offered them to galleries, auction houses and others.

In the South Florida case, Righter sent several forgeries from Los Angeles to a Miami gallery. He was asking more than $1 million for the forgeries, which were seized by the FBI. In total, Righter’s scheme attempted to scam victims out of more than $6 million and caused losses of more than $750,000.

Righter pleaded guilty Wednesday to additional counts of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraud for a Los Angeles case. He received an additional five years for that case, but the two sentences will run concurrently. The tax fraud totaled more than $100,000.

A consolidated restitution hearing is set for Sept. 30."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors filed charges against the country’s Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating a bribery scheme in 2009 when he was governor of Mato Grosso state.

Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutor’s office.

Maggi denies any wrongdoing, said the press office of the agriculture minister in a written statement.

Under Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision.

Dodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court 12 million reais ($3.4 million) in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.

Almeida was removed from the court last year and faces a trial in a lower-level federal court in connection with the supposed scheme.

Almeida could not be reached for comment."

The heir to the Nina Ricci perfume and fashion fortune has been convicted of tax fraud by a Paris court after hiding millions in an offshore HSBC account.

Arlette Ricci, 73, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay a €1 million (£720,000;$1.1m) fine.

The court also confiscated two properties worth four million euros (£2.9m;$4.2m).

HSBC's Swiss private banking arm is being investigated after a leak revealed large scale tax fraud.

Ms Ricci, who can appeal, was given a two-year suspended sentence on top of her one-year custodial sentence.

Her daughter, Margot Vignat, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Ms Ricci was accused of hiding millions of euros from the French authorities to evade tax using an offshore HSBC account.

She was ordered by the court to pay millions in back taxes for the period of 2007-2009, with the exact amount to be set at a later date.

Ms Ricci's lawyer, Jean-Marc Fedida, claimed his client had been made an example of, calling her sentence ""extremely severe"".

Mr Fedida said he may ask the judge to let Ms Ricci serve the sentence under lenient conditions, such as partial liberty or wearing an electronic tag.

But telephone recordings quoted in court apparently showed that the perfume heiress was aware she was breaking the law.

In one phone conversation, she said, laughing, ""I believe I did the right thing and I never heard from Bercy so all is well,"" referring to the French finance ministry.

""Yes, inevitably, necessarily because all that is illegal anyway,"" she said.

'Unacceptable' practices

Ms Ricci, who has consistently denied the accusations against her, will now have to decide whether to appeal against her conviction.

She was the first of around 50 French nationals to face trial over tax evasion in the HSBC case. Her prosecution was seen as a test case for the so-called ""Swissleaks"" scandal.

A list of thousands of HSBC's clients was passed to the French government in 2009 by whistleblower Herve Falciani, a former employee of the bank's private operation in Switzerland.

But the bank's tax-evasion practices didn't come to light until the documents were reported by the BBC's Panorama programme and a host of other international media outlets in 2015.

Widespread media coverage led to criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina but not in the UK, where HSBC is based.

The UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted."

Among recent enforcement actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission shut down a $78 million pump-and-dump scheme involving a coffee company with ties to the late reggae great Bob Marley.

In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Deutsche Bank Securities $1.4 million on short interest reporting failures and fined Signator Investors $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding consolidated reports.

SEC Investigating Pump-and-Dump of Marley Coffee Stock

The SEC charged several individuals in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the stock of the stock of Jammin’ Java, a company that operates as Marley Coffee and uses trademarks of late reggae artist Bob Marley to sell coffee products.

According to the agency, Jammin’ Java’s former CEO Shane Whittle put together the scheme with the aid of three individuals living abroad and the offshore entities they control. Whittle utilized a reverse merger to secretly gain control of millions of Jammin’ Java shares, and he spread the stock to the offshore entities controlled by Wayne Weaver of the U.K. and Canada, Michael Sun of India and René Berlinger of Switzerland.

Charged with fraudulently promoting Jammin’ Java stock to investors are British twin brothers Alexander and Thomas Hunter, who were previously charged in a separate SEC case for touting multiple penny stocks using a fake stock picking robot. Others charged in the SEC’s complaint with pushing the illegal offering through their offshore entities are U.K. citizens Stephen Wheatley and Kevin Miller and Oman resident Mohammed Al-Barwani.

Stock promoter Whittle befriended Rohan Marley — a son of Bob Marley — in Los Angeles. When he learned that Marley had bought a small Jamaican coffee farm, Whittle proposed the creation of a large-scale coffee distribution business built on the Marley name.

To raise capital for the venture, Whittle identified publicly traded shell company Global Electronic Recovery Corp. (GERC), which was a purported waste management business in Los Angeles. He executed a reverse merger between GERC and Marley Coffee, which later became Jammin’ Java and trades under the ticker symbol JAMN. In connection with the reverse merger, Whittle secretly gained control of millions of shares that previously had been issued to foreign nominees.

Using his access and control of Jammin’ Java and its stock, Whittle and others put together an illegal offering and the fraudulent promotion of Jammin’ Java’s stock in a pump-and-dump scheme that culminated in the middle of 2011. In anticipation of the promotion, Whittle distributed some of the nominee stock to offshore entities controlled by Weaver, Sun and Berlinger.

To boost the stock price and provide cash to Jammin’ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun and Berlinger created a fake financing arrangement to make it look as if there were legitimate third-party interest and investment in the company. Jammin’ Java’s announcement of the financing agreement and other company announcements, along with coordinated trading by entities connected to the scheme, boosted the stock price.

Whittle hid his control of the stock and other aspects of the scheme, lying in beneficial ownership reports that he filed with the SEC. He also distributed another large block of stock to offshore entities, including those controlled or owned by Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller and Al-Barwani. Whittle, Weaver, Sun, and Berlinger hid their beneficial ownership of Jammin’ Java stock.

The Hunters published false stock newsletters and took other actions to raise the stock’s price; then, when the price was up, the defendants and others coordinating with them dumped 45 million shares on the public market without registering the transactions, making at least $78 million in illicit profits. Weaver, Sun and Berlinger funneled $2.5 million in profits to Jammin’ Java under the guise of the phony financing arrangement that launched the promotion.

Jammin’ Java’s share price and volume began to collapse a few days after the company disclosed on May 9, 2011, that it became aware of an unauthorized and unaffiliated online stock promotion. Disappointing financial results in its annual report took the price down even more.

Marley was not accused of wrongdoing.

Jammin’ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller, Al-Barwani and the Hunter brothers face various charges. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars against all of the individuals and an officer-and-director bar against Whittle.

Deutsche Bank Securities Hit by FINRA for $1.4 Million

FINRA has fined Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. $1.4 million for violations of the short interest reporting rule and related supervisory failures.

According to the agency, for more than 10 years, Deutsche Bank has been improperly including securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate in numerous aggregation units when determining each unit’s net position.

Firms are generally allowed to track their positions in a security from certain trading operations or trading desks separately from other positions maintained at the firm through the use of an “aggregation unit.” But in determining the net positions of aggregation units, firms cannot include the securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate. In addition, FINRA requires firms, with some exceptions, to regularly report their total “short” positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts in equity securities. These short positions must be reported on a gross, rather than a net basis.

But from April 2004 to September 2012, Deutsche Bank reported the netted positions in its financial aggregation account as the firm’s short interest positions for that particular day.

FINRA also found that, during the period when the violations occurred, Deutsche Bank’s supervisory system, with respect to its aggregation unit structure and short interest reporting, was not designed to detect and prevent them.

The firm neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the sanctions.

FINRA Censures, Fines Signator Investors $450,000

FINRA censured Signator Investors Inc. and fined it $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding registered representatives’ use of consolidated reports. In addition, Gregory Joseph Mitchell was assessed a deferred fine of $10,000 and suspended from association with any FINRA member in any supervisory capacity for seven months.

According to the agency, Mitchell failed to enforce the firm’s policies and procedures related to client file reviews and branch audits by providing advance notice of which client files would be reviewed, as well as advance notice of unannounced branch audits to registered representatives. In addition, despite being reprimanded by the firm’s director of compliance for surveillance, Mitchell continued to notify registered representatives in advance which files would be reviewed, and the firm did nothing to stop him.

The firm made a consolidated reporting system available to its registered representatives that allowed the representatives to enter customized values for assets and accounts held away from the firm into a consolidated report. However, the firm not only lacked an adequate supervisory system to review those reports, including the accuracy of manually entered valuations provided to the customers, but its procedures never mentioned either supervising consolidated reports or how to use the system — in fact, there was no review process for consolidated reports; as a result, the firm’s supervisors didn’t even know who was responsible for reviewing the reports.

FINRA found other procedural failures, including failure to adequately review incoming and outgoing correspondence, failure to maintain consolidated reports that were sent to its customers and failures in its written supervisory procedures regarding its client file review and branch audit programs."

197	Canberk	Raj Kumar Singh	Person	https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/a-deadly-new-form-of-terrorism-sms-and-photoshop/	"A fatal mass exodus has gripped southern India as residents flee in response to images and messages of impending attacks. The problem is the pictures are faked and false rumors of impending doom are being circulated through SMS. “Morphed pictures, false messages were used to provocate people and trigger panic,” Indian Home Secretary R.K. Singh told reporters. “A total of 76 websites were identified where morphed images were uploaded, and the bulk of these were uploaded in Pakistan.” A ban on bulk texting had attempted to stem earlier threats as officials assured residents of their safety, but this cheap new form of terrorism is overwhelming.

The unknown source of the Indian rumors exploited recent sectarian violence in the northeastern city of Assam that have left 75 dead and 300,000 stranded in shelters. Northeastern migrants, many of whom had recently moved to the south to find work, were supposedly threatened by retaliatory attacks if they did not return home. “We have seen the messages on our phones and on the internet. It is not safe to stay here, we are safer at home,” said one student.

Panicked stampedes have already claimed the the lives of two and injured 9 others after fearful residents pushed victims from a moving train. Indian authorities have been shuttering websites and social media accounts like a game of whack-a-mole, but it’s difficult to see how they can keep up.

The incident underscores both the accessibility of new forms of cyber-terrorism and the tricky credibility of social media.

Having experienced SMS rumors of a deadly gunman myself as graduate student at UC Irvine, I know how powerfully credibly social media can seem. Mild panic gripped the campus in 2009 when rumors of a gunman began circulating through Facebook and SMS. UCI authorities alerted students to stay inside. Getting official reports was difficult, since the university website was crippled by incoming traffic. Facebook and Twitter, which were much better sources of real-time information, spread conflicting reports.

The university did eventually send out official emergency messages via text, but waiting 10 or 15 minutes to receive them was a disturbingly long amount of time. In the midst of (perceived) threats, we updated Facebook and Twitter by the second. Ultimately, the “gunman” was just some guy with a paintball gun, but that didn’t stop me and my students from fearfully hiding inside until well after the incident was over.

Since Twitter and Facebook are both faster sources of information and are relaying potential first-hand accounts, they’re a tempting source of credibility, especially when fear leads one to err on the side of believing the more dangerous rumors.

India is unfortunately vulnerable to prolonged rumors, but its easy to see how this new form of terrorism, combining realistic images and SMS, could cause crowds in any country to panic. The situation brings renewed urgency for Congress to start making real gains on cybersecurity legislation, which has thus far been blocked by partisan gridlock. While the the most recent bill only deals with direct cyber attacks, it’s imperative that our government be able to make steady progress on national security."

379	Dan	Stephen Davey	Person	https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/fraudster-stephen-davey-posed-police-16873683	"A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about £8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than £400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about £400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

Magistrates' court

Most criminal cases are heard in a magistrates' court. The magistrates are usually people who live in the local community, sometimes called justices of the peace. There are usually three magistrates who are supported by a legally trained advisor. Sometimes cases are tried by one magistrate, called a district judge, who is a lawyer.

Magistrates' courts are not as formal as the Crown Court, the magistrates do not wear wigs and only the ushers (court officials who keep everything running smoothly) wear black gowns.

Crown Court

Some cases are heard in the Crown Court. There are three situations where a case may be 'tried' at the Crown Court:

Serious crimes
Cases where the defendant (the person accused of the crime) has asked to have his case tried by a jury
Magistrates may send a case to the Crown Court if they feel they do not have the power to set a sentence as severe as the crime deserves

Cases at the Crown Court are tried by a jury. These are 12 people from the general public who listen to the evidence presented during the trial and decide if the defendant is guilty of the crime. The judge decides on matters of law during the trial, such as whether certain evidence is allowed to be presented. The judge also makes sure the trial proceeds in a fair way. At the end of the trial if the defendant is found guilty the judge decides the sentence for the crime (for example how long the defendant must spend in prison).

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft."

66	Canberk	Western Union	Company	https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/western-union-often-disrupted-by-startups-partners-a-startup-for-digital-push-in-the-philippines/	"Global money mover Western Union is commonly a target for fintech companies, but the firm is teaming up with a startup to help increase its presence in the world’s third-most lucrative remittance market: the Philippines.

Coins, the Manila-based fintech startup that was recently acquired by $10 billion ride-hailing company Go-Jek, said today that it will integrate Western Union, which is valued at $8 billion on the NYSE, into its app to allow Philippines-based users to receive money sent to them from overseas.

The Philippines is a mighty country when it comes to money transfers. There are some 10 million Philippine nationals based overseas and a recent World Bank report ranked the company the world’s third-most lucrative corridor with an estimated $34 billion sent home from overseas last year. (That’s the same as Mexico, with India and China in first and second place, respectively.)

The partnership means Coins users — the company claims five million downloads to date — who receive money via Western Union won’t need to trudge out and wait in line to collect it. Instead, it can be remitted to the Coins app, from where it can be transferred on to other people (peer-to-peer transfers are free) or used on the Coins platform for other payments. Money in the app can be used to pay for utility bills, mobile top-up, public transport trips and at merchants that support its payment service.

One thing the alliance doesn’t do, however, is remove Western Union fees, but Coins founder and CEO Ron Hose is optimistic that the deal brings value for both parties and consumers in the Philippines.

“Our mission is working with banks and financial service providers to bring services to people who don’t have access,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.

Hose declined to comment on Western Union payments — which are routinely seized upon by startups that look to offer more transparent and cheaper overseas transfers — but, in theory, moving money digitally could pave the way for retail-based remitters, like Western Union, to reduce operational costs and potentially make their service cheaper for consumers in the future.

Western Union already operates its own apps, but, like a number of “old school” global money platforms, its business is inherently a retail one rather than a tech one. That’s because it has a strong physical presence — with more than 500,000 location worldwide and some 12,000 in the Philippines alone — which brings with it operational costs, while there is also KYC and other anti-laundering processes that increase expenditure.

It remains to be seen where the Coins-Western Union deal will head. Parent company Go-Jek is busily expanding into Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore while it has a strong base in its native Indonesia, so there could be potential for further alliances in the future.

The Philippines is part of the broad “Middle East, Africa, and South Asia” region in Western Union’s financial reporting. The company reported flat growth in the region last year, with it accounting for 15 percent of all revenue. It grossed $1.4 billion in sales in the final quarter, but that was down three percent year-on-year. On the positive side, Western Union said its online service grew to 12 percent of consumer sales in the quarter — deals like the Coins partnership are aimed at finding its digital future."

46	Sebastien	SHIRI Perence	individual	https://gambakwe.com/2020/07/29/the-untold-truth-of-perrence-shiri-life-and-history/	"Perence Shiri born Bigboy Samson Chikerema on 11 January 1955 died on the 28th of July 2020

Shiri was a Zimbabwean air officer and government official who served as Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe from 1 December 2017 until his death in 2020.

He was the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe and member of the Joint Operations Command which exerts day-by-day control over Zimbabwe’s government.

Perrance Shiri was a cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, he called himself “Black Jesus” because according to an anonymous claim on BBC Panorama documentary “The Price of Silence”, he “could determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or not.”

On 30 November 2017, Shiri was appointed Minister of Agriculture by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. On 18 December he was promoted from Air Marshall to Air Chief Marshall upon retirement.

Shiri was widely criticized by human-rights organizations for his part in masterminding Zimbabwe’s Gukurahundi massacres. The killings, which took place between 1982 and 1985, left as many as 20,000 dead in the country’s two Matabeleland provinces and the Midlands Province.

At the time, Shiri commanded the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, which is accused of mass executions and torture.

Shiri died on 28 July 2020. It is believed that the minister succumbed to COVID-19 and died after having being hospitalised two days earlier.

In 1992, Shiri was appointed as the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, taking over from Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai.

Shiri was in command of the Zimbabwean troops at the start of the Second Congo War. It was Shiri who decided that the Zimbabwean contingent would defend N’Djili and its airport. This was in order to maintain an air route for resupply and reinforcements if needed.

In the late-1990s and early-2000s, Shiri was reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans. In 2002, in response to the subsequent food shortage, Mugabe dispatched Shiri to South Africa to purchase maize. This undertaking was backed by a credit note for the equivalent of £17 million from the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi.

Shiri was ambushed on 13 December 2008, while driving to his farm. According to police, he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car. Thinking one of his tyres had burst he got out and was subsequently shot in the arm. It has been speculated that the assassination attempt may have been a response to Shiri’s attacks on illegal diamond miners in 2008 or because of his role in Matabeleland in the 1980s.

In October 2013, Shiri’s son, Titus Takudzwa Chikerema, died at the age of 21."

The killings, which took place between 1982 and 1985, left as many as 20,000 dead in the country’s two Matabeleland provinces and the Midlands Province.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Shiri commanded the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, which is accused of mass executions and torture.</p>\n\n<p>Shiri died on 28 July 2020. It is believed that the minister succumbed to COVID-19 and died after having being hospitalised two days earlier.</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, Shiri was appointed as the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, taking over from Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai.</p>\n\n<p>Shiri was in command of the Zimbabwean troops at the start of the Second Congo War. It was Shiri who decided that the Zimbabwean contingent would defend N’Djili and its airport. This was in order to maintain an air route for resupply and reinforcements if needed.</p>\n\n<p>In the late-1990s and early-2000s, Shiri was reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans. In 2002, in response to the subsequent food shortage, Mugabe dispatched Shiri to South Africa to purchase maize. This undertaking was backed by a credit note for the equivalent of £17 million from the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi.</p>\n\n<p>Shiri was ambushed on 13 December 2008, while driving to his farm. According to police, he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car. Thinking one of his tyres had burst he got out and was subsequently shot in the arm. It has been speculated that the assassination attempt may have been a response to Shiri’s attacks on illegal diamond miners in 2008 or because of his role in Matabeleland in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2013, Shiri’s son, Titus Takudzwa Chikerema, died at the age of 21.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<br></p>\n\n</article>', 'dateModifiedRaw': '2020-08-22T13:58:01+02:00', 'datePublishedRaw': '2020-07-29T12:49:36+02:00'}, 'webPage': {'inLanguages': [{'code': 'en'}]}, 'algorithmVersion': '20.10.1'}]"	0	contains words 'mass execution' and 'massacres' and he is accused, but he died	Carel		The Untold Truth of Perence Shiri, Life and History
217	Wanting	SoftBank Group	company	https://newsoncompliance.com/softbank-fund-invests-100-million-in-compliance-software-firm/	"NEW YORK – SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund 2 is investing $100 million in compliance and employee-monitoring software company Behavox, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The investment, which is in the form of preferred shares, values Behavox at about $500 million, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

The investment group will also be represented on the company’s board, the sources added.

The deal is among the first for the second incarnation of SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. It comes at a time when the company faces growing scrutiny from investors, including activist Elliott Management Corp., amid high-profile setbacks such as WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.

Behavox uses machine learning and advanced analytics software to help alert companies to potential wrongdoing among employees. The company’s customers include SoftBank Investment Advisers, as well as banks, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms.

“This investment will allow Behavox to further focus on and invest in the needs of our customers,” said Erkin Adylov, the firm’s founder and chief executive officer.

SoftBank Investment Advisers Managing Partner Munish Varma said Behavox is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution that will make internal communications data useful to a broad range of users, from compliance to analysis of insider threats and from archiving and data governance to CRM automation.

Adylov and key employees will remain the largest shareholders in the Behavox.

SoftBank quietly completed an initial money-raising push for its second technology fund at a fraction of its targeted $108 billion, people familiar with the matter said in November. The company raised roughly $2 billion for the second Vision Fund and was still canvassing for additional money, the people said at the time."

66	Kristjan	Rifaat al-Assad 	Person	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53077818	"The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been sentenced to four years in prison by a Paris court for money-laundering.

Rifaat al-Assad was convicted of embezzling Syrian state funds to buy homes and offices worth €90m (£80m) to build a French property portfolio.

The 82-year-old former vice-president denies any wrongdoing. His lawyers say he will appeal.

His property assets in Paris and London will be seized, the court ruled.

Assad, who was hospitalised with internal bleeding in France in December, was not in court for the ruling and is unlikely to serve his sentence due to his age. His London property is believed to be worth €29m (£26m).

Who is Rifaat al-Assad?

He was once the second most powerful man in Syria - the military commander at the right hand of his brother Hafez, who led Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000.

Rifaat is known as the ""Butcher of Hama"" by some Syrians because of his alleged role in the bloody suppression of an anti-government uprising in the city in 1982 but he has denied any responsibility for the massacre. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people are estimated to have died.

Since 1984, when he led a failed coup against his brother, Rifaat has mostly lived in exile in France and Spain.

After Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat proclaimed himself his brother's legitimate successor. But Bashar became president.

When Syria descended into civil war in 2011 he called on his nephew to step down.

His lawyers say his political past is irrelevant to an investigation into his financial activities.

What is the case about?

Rifaat al-Assad has been under investigation in France since 2014, when the legal NGO Sherpa, which defends victims of alleged economic crimes, filed a complaint saying the value of his property empire far exceeded his known income.

Five years later, the French judicial authorities decided that he should stand trial for crimes allegedly committed between 1984 and 2016, including organised money laundering, aggravated tax fraud and misappropriation of Syrian state funds.

The trial opened on 9 December last year. Assad denied the charges, saying he was given gifts by the Saudi royal family.

His reported French fortune includes two Paris townhouses, a stud farm, a chateau and 7,300 square metres of office space in Lyon. Several luxury properties have already been seized by French authorities.

Assad and his family also have a portfolio of 507 properties in Spain valued at around €695m (£585m).

The properties were seized by the Spanish authorities in 2017 as part of a separate investigation into alleged money-laundering activities by Assad and 13 other people, who have again denied any wrongdoing.

This is the second trial of a member of a foreign ruling family in France on charges of ""ill-gotten gains"".

In October 2017, Equatorial Guinea vice president Teodorin Obiang received a three-year suspended jail term after being convicted of using public money to fund a lavish lifestyle."

90	Karl			https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26866084	"Published

The European Parliament has urged EU governments to impose sanctions on 32 Russian officials over the death of a lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.

The parliament's resolution calls for visa bans and asset freezes - measures that the US has already imposed.

Magnitsky died in prison in 2009 after accusing officials of tax fraud.

A Moscow court convicted Magnitsky himself of embezzlement posthumously - a trial seen in the West as a gross miscarriage of justice.

There is evidence that he suffered torture and neglect in prison. The US blacklist, in force since 2012, drew strong condemnation from Russia.

Acting on behalf of London-based Hermitage Capital Management, Magnitsky had exposed an alleged fraud in which government officials stole $230m (£138m; 169m euros) of tax revenue.

But instead of prosecuting any of the alleged embezzlers, the police arrested Magnitsky.

Frosty relations

The MEPs' resolution comes amid heightened tensions between the EU and Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The EU and US have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on senior Russian officials considered to be linked to the annexation.

Various politicians in Europe have urged their governments to adopt a US-style Magnitsky list. Last year the Irish parliament dropped plans for such a blacklist after Russia warned that it might stop adoptions by Irish parents in retaliation.

Many of the names on the proposed European Magnitsky list are also among the 18 named in the US list, including interior ministry investigators Pavel Karpov and Oleg Silchenko, and judge Yelena Stashina.

The European Parliament said the arrest and death in custody of Magnitsky represented a ""well-documented and significant case of disrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia"", which had ""cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of its judicial institutions, and serve as a reminder of the many documented shortcomings in respect for the rule of law in Russia""."

30	Carel	Jose Irizarry	Individual	https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-dea-agent-arrested-money-laundering-scheme-colombian-cartel	"A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent known for his lavish lifestyle was arrested Friday on charges of conspiring to launder money for the same Colombian drug cartel he was supposed to be investigating.

Authorities arrested Jose Irizarry and his wife at their home near San Juan, Puerto Rico. Federal prosecutors say in a 19-count indictment that the 49-year-old used ""his position and his special access to information” to launder millions in drug profits.
They both posted $10,000 bail and were released.
“It’s a black eye for the DEA to have one of its own engaged in such a high level of corruption,"" said Mike Vigil, the DEA's former chief of international operations. ""He jeopardized investigations. He jeopardized other agents and he jeopardized informants.""
Irizarry had been a model agent after joining the DEA in Miami in 2009. He was entrusted with an undercover money-laundering operation using front companies, shell bank accounts and couriers. Irizarry resigned in January 2018 after being reassigned to Washington when his boss in Colombia became suspicious.
￼
Previous reports by The Associated Press detailed his alleged wrongdoing last year.
“His fingerprints are all over dozens of arrests and indictments,” said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami. “It could have a ripple effect and cause courts to re-examine any case he was involved in.”
Authorities said Irizarry filed false reports and misled superiors while directing the DEA to wire funds intended for undercover operations to accounts in Spain and other countries. The accounts were either controlled by him or connected to his wife and co-conspirators, prosecutors said.

The money funded a lavish lifestyle that included the purchase of a $30,000 Tiffany diamond ring, a BMW, three Land Rovers and a $767,000 home in Cartagena, as well as homes in south Florida and Puerto Rico, where the couple has been living.
A red Lamborghini with the same vehicle ID named in the indictment belongs to Jenny Ambuila, who was arrested last year in Colombia along with her father, Omar Ambuila, a customs agent in the port of Buenaventura, a major transit point for cocaine and contraband goods used to conceal the proceeds of narcotics sales. Before her arrest, Ambuila shared photos and videos of herself on Facebook posing next to the red sports car, which is valued at more than $300,000.
￼
One of two unnamed co-conspirators in the indictment is Diego Martin, a relative of Irizarry's wife, The AP reported. Martin is considered one of the top money-laundering suspects in Colombia over the past decade, according to U.S. and Colombian officials.
He was arrested in 1993 for allegedly hiding money for the Cali cartel in home appliances bound for Colombia. He was never charged and eluded prosecution ever since by leveraging relationships built over decades as an informant to multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies, the officials said.
The indictment comes a week after another DEA agent was sentenced to four years in prison for smuggling drugs from Puerto Rico to New York.

240	Dan	Hector Luis PALMA SALAZAR	Person	https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-06-25-mn-17142-story.html	"MEXICO CITY —

Federal agents called in the Mexican army to arrest one of the nation’s most powerful drug barons, a man wanted in the 1993 murder of Guadalajara’s Roman Catholic cardinal, during a late-night raid that also snared 33 federal agents who were protecting him, authorities said Saturday.

Mexico’s attorney general said Hector Luis Palma Salazar, reputed leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in an exclusive neighborhood of Guadalajara and charged with several murders and drug-related crimes.

Palma allegedly took over one of the five major cartels that U.S. drug enforcement agents say transport three-fourths of the cocaine entering the United States after its previous leader was jailed in the murder of the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. Palma was also wanted in connection with that crime, and the Mexican government had posted a $1-million reward for information leading to his capture.

The arrests late Friday were seen as a clear sign of President Ernesto Zedillo’s commitment to crack down on the cartels. They also underscored the close ties that exist between drug kingpins and some federal officials.

Confirming Palma’s arrest at an evening news conference in Mexico City, Atty. Gen. Antonio Lozano said the army was called in as a precaution because federal police were directly involved with Palma.

Mexican soldiers formed a cordon around the Guadalajara office of the federal attorney general--to guard against retaliation--while agents from Mexico City arrested Palma, along with Apolinar Pintor Aguilera, the federal judicial police commander. Jalisco state authorities said Palma identified Pintor as his “protector.”

Authorities also detained 33 federal police officers who they said had been serving as Palma’s personal bodyguards. Lozano said his agents seized large quantities of drugs and about $10,000 in cash.

Palma was reportedly a lieutenant of Joaquin (Chapo) Guzman, former leader of the cartel in Sinaloa, a state notorious for violence and marijuana production. U.S. and Mexican officials said the cartel has extensive networks in Central and South America and has been instrumental in exporting Colombian cocaine into the United States through Mexico.

Authorities said Palma became the cartel’s leader after Guzman’s arrest in 1993. Guzman has also been charged with participating in the murder of Posadas, who was shot more than a dozen times in what the previous government called a case of mistaken identity.

Lozano, the first attorney general to come from an opposition political party, has vowed to arrest the leaders of all the major cartels and to solve several high-profile political murders, among them the killing of the cardinal.

Religious leaders and human rights groups have cast doubt on the official version of the slaying on March 24, 1993, outside the Guadalajara airport. Posadas was an outspoken critic of the drug cartels that Mexican and U.S. drug enforcement officials say have infiltrated the government at high enough levels to threaten the nation’s stability.

Officials now say the airport slaying, in which six others died, was masterminded by the Arellano Felix brothers and their Tijuana drug cartel, a rival of Palma’s Sinaloa cartel. One of the four brothers, Francisco Arellano Felix, has been captured, but the three others remain at large. There is a $1-million reward for information leading to the arrest of any of the brothers.

Authorities have not released details of what roles Guzman and Palma allegedly played in the cardinal’s assassination.

The cardinal’s slaying was the first in a series of political murders that caused billions of dollars in investment to flee the country, helping to trigger Mexico’s continuing economic crisis and fueling national insecurity.

A year after Posadas’ death, ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was slain in Tijuana. And six months after that, the party’s secretary general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot to death in Mexico City."

137	Dan	Howayda Hamdan	Person	https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/former-banker-sentenced-more-seven-years-laundering-proceeds-stolen-identity-refund	"Tampa, FL – U.S. District Judge James S. Moody, Jr. has sentenced Howayda Hamdan to seven years and six months in federal prison for engaging in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. As part of her sentence, the court also entered a money judgment in the amount of $1,168,858.11, the proceeds of the conspiracy. Hamdan pleaded guilty on August 21, 2014.

According to court documents, from January 2011 to April 20, 2011, while working as a personal banker for Regions Bank, Hamdan opened 292 bank accounts using 146 stolen identities. These accounts were opened for the sole purpose of laundering fraudulently obtained federal income tax refund checks that were acquired using the stolen identities of another 219 unknowing victims.

Hamdan’s co-conspirators, Riad Sulaiman, Nedal Ahmad, and Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja, owned and operated businesses where they knowingly negotiated fraudulently obtained tax refund checks. The co-conspirators brought the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks to Hamdan so they could be deposited and the proceeds withdrawn. Many of these checks were issued in the names of deceased individuals.

Hamdan needed means of identification, including names and Social Security numbers, to open the accounts at Regions Bank. Co-conspirator Dana Brown, a police officer, provided printouts from DAVID, Florida’s driver’s license database. The printouts contained the personally identifiable information (PII) required to open the bogus bank accounts. Since the victims of the tax filing scheme were often deceased, lived outside Florida, and/or were unknown to Hamdan and her co-conspirators, the stolen identities used to open the bank accounts were different, although similar in name, than the stolen identities used by the tax filers to obtain the tax refunds.

Once Hamdan deposited the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks, she facilitated the distribution of the proceeds to her co-conspirators, including her husband, Hicham El Faoutih. In May 2011, agents searched Hamdan’s residence. Among other things, they recovered $81,460.00 in cash (still inside a Regions Bank bag and wrapped with bank wrappers); three fraudulently obtained Treasury checks; a ledger containing hundreds of names and Social Security numbers; and stolen identities that had been provided by Brown.

In total, Hamdan facilitated the deposit or receipt of $1,168,858.11 in fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The government has also identified more than 400 victims whose identities were stolen during the course of Hamdan’s activities.

The co-conspirators in this case were previously prosecuted and sentenced. In July 2014, Hicham El Faoutih was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. Nedal Ahmad was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison in June 2013. In June 2012, Ocala Police officer Dana Brown was sentenced to six years and five months in federal prison. In December 2011, Riad Sulaiman was sentenced in the Southern District of Florida to 41 months in federal prison. In August 2013, Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja was sentenced in the Western District of Virginia to 70 months in federal prison; this sentence is being served concurrent to a 37-month sentence imposed in April 2012 in the Middle District of Florida case.

This case was investigated by the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Mandy Riedel."
